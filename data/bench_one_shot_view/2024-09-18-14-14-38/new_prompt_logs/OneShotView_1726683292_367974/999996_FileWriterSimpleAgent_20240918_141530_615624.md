## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use a flex container to create a vertical layout with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom. We'll use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, ensuring we use container query sizing.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title using a large, bold text at the top of the screen. We'll assume the title is "Creature Battle" for this implementation.

4. Button Section:
   We'll create a section for buttons at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Interactivity:
   We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and thing interactions.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use container query classes (cq-*) to ensure the layout adjusts properly within the game container.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's implement the component:

# Excerpt ID: f2a2f244-7ade-637c-71ee-d2ffc2da4a84
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      emitButtonClick(slug);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="cq-h-full cq-w-full flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="text-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Creature Battle</h1>
        <p className="text-xl text-white">
          Welcome, {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || 'Player'}!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
            className="w-48 h-16 text-xl"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
          </Button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
            variant="outline"
            className="w-48 h-16 text-xl"
          >
            <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the architecture described above:

1. We've removed the boilerplate and unnecessary comments.
2. We've kept the named exports and existing imports.
3. We've implemented null checks and fallback rendering (e.g., for the player's name).
4. We're using the UI components that were already imported (Button).
5. We've added imports from 'lucide-react' for icons (Play and X).
6. We're using container query sizing (cq-h-full, cq-w-full) instead of viewport units.
7. The layout uses a flex container to position elements vertically.
8. We're checking availableButtonSlugs before rendering buttons.
9. We've implemented click handlers for buttons using the provided hooks.

This implementation creates a visually appealing main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and buttons at the bottom. The layout is responsive and will adjust to the container size. The player's name is displayed if available, and buttons are only shown if they're in the availableButtonSlugs array.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

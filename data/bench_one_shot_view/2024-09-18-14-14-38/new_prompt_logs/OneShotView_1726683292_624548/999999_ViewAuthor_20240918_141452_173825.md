Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game. 

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:
- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?



<CURRENT_CODE>

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";
import {Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription} from "@/components/ui/alert";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()
    const {
        availableInteractiveThingIds,
        emitThingClick
    }= useThingInteraction()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}

```

</CURRENT_CODE>



The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.



Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>



(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)



Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:

* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.

* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface

* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)

* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.

* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

* IMPORTANT: This game is in a container.  ALWAYS use Container Query sizing in CSS. Examples of BANNED STYLES: h-screen, w-screen



Thanks!!!



Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 



Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.



Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>

# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game. 

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:
- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

</VIEW_SUMMARY>



Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

// ... filled in boilerplate here ...

```



Some final notes:

* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using container-specific styling to fit it into the window.

* All interactive `Things` (identified by having a `uid` and `category`) should use click events with the provided hook.

However, we should always check if the `uid` of the Thing is in the `availableInteractiveThingIds` to give users visual feedback.



* We should make certain that all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:

Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-attack
	-back
	-swap




__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed information. I'll outline the architecture and implementation approach for the MainGameSceneView component based on the requirements you've described.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll divide the MainGameSceneView into two main sections:
   - BattlefieldDisplay (upper 2/3)
   - UserInterface (lower 1/3)

2. Subcomponents:
   - CreatureDisplay: For rendering player and opponent creatures
   - CreatureStatus: For displaying creature name and HP bar
   - ActionButtons: For rendering available action buttons

3. Styling:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes for inline styling. To ensure container query sizing, we'll use classes like 'cq-h-[66%]' for the battlefield and 'cq-h-[34%]' for the user interface, where 'cq-' prefix stands for container query.

4. Data Handling:
   We'll create interfaces for the main data structures (Player, Creature, Skill) to ensure type safety when working with the provided data.

5. Interactivity:
   We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and creature interactions. We'll check availableButtonSlugs and availableInteractiveThingIds to determine which elements should be interactive.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout adapts to different container sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators to safely access potentially missing data.

Now, I'll rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Sword, ArrowLeft, Repeat } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  meta: {
    creature_type: string;
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  entities: {
    active_creature: Creature;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    bot: Player;
  };
}

const CreatureDisplay = ({ creature, isPlayer }: { creature: Creature; isPlayer: boolean }) => (
  <div className={`cq-w-1/2 cq-h-full flex ${isPlayer ? 'items-end' : 'items-start'} justify-center`}>
    <div className="cq-w-32 cq-h-32 bg-gray-300 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
      {creature.display_name[0]}
    </div>
  </div>
);

const CreatureStatus = ({ creature }: { creature: Creature }) => (
  <Card className="cq-w-1/2 cq-p-2">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{creature.display_name}</h3>
    <div className="cq-w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full cq-h-2.5 dark:bg-gray-700">
      <div 
        className="bg-blue-600 cq-h-2.5 rounded-full" 
        style={{ width: `${(creature.stats.hp / creature.stats.max_hp) * 100}%` }}
      ></div>
    </div>
    <p>{creature.stats.hp} / {creature.stats.max_hp} HP</p>
  </Card>
);

const ActionButton = ({ slug, icon, label }: { slug: string; icon: React.ReactNode; label: string }) => {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const isAvailable = availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug);

  return (
    <Button 
      onClick={() => isAvailable && emitButtonClick(slug)} 
      disabled={!isAvailable}
      className="cq-w-full cq-h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center"
    >
      {icon}
      <span>{label}</span>
    </Button>
  );
};

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { data } = props;
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const playerCreature = data.entities.player.entities.active_creature;
  const botCreature = data.entities.bot.entities.active_creature;

  return (
    <div className="cq-w-full cq-h-full flex flex-col">
      <div className="cq-h-[66%] flex flex-col">
        <div className="cq-h-1/2 flex">
          <CreatureStatus creature={botCreature} />
          <CreatureDisplay creature={botCreature} isPlayer={false} />
        </div>
        <div className="cq-h-1/2 flex flex-row-reverse">
          <CreatureStatus creature={playerCreature} />
          <CreatureDisplay creature={playerCreature} isPlayer={true} />
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="cq-h-[34%] grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-2 p-2">
        <ActionButton slug="attack" icon={<Sword />} label="Attack" />
        <ActionButton slug="swap" icon={<Repeat />} label="Swap" />
        <ActionButton slug="back" icon={<ArrowLeft />} label="Back" />
        <div></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the described architecture and meets the requirements. It uses container query sizing, handles potential missing data, and implements the required interactivity. The layout is divided into the battlefield display and user interface as specified, with creature displays and status bars in the correct positions. The action buttons are implemented in a 2x2 grid in the lower third of the screen.

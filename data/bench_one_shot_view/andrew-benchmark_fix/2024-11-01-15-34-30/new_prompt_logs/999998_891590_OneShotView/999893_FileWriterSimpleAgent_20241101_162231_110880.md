## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The main problem causing the timeout error is likely the absence of clickable buttons in the user interface area. The lower third of the screen appears empty, which means the skill buttons are not being rendered.

2. The creature displays are visible and seem to be positioned correctly, but they are taking up more vertical space than necessary, which might be pushing the UI area off-screen.

3. The HUD at the top is present and displaying player names correctly.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Modify the skill button rendering logic to ensure that all available skills are displayed, not just 'lick' and 'tackle'.
2. Adjust the layout to ensure the UI area is always visible, possibly by reducing the size of the battlefield area.
3. Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` are being properly populated and used.

Here's the implementation of these solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 2689a1d2-0a02-4e70-bc60-8215578d2fb4
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react'
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  meta: {
    creature_type: string;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

const CreatureDisplay = ({ creature, isPlayer }: { creature: Creature; isPlayer: boolean }) => (
  <Card className={`flex flex-col items-center p-2 ${isPlayer ? 'order-1' : 'order-2'}`}>
    <div className="text-lg font-bold">{creature.display_name}</div>
    <div className="w-24 h-24 bg-gray-300 rounded-full mb-2"></div>
    <div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2.5 dark:bg-gray-700">
      <div className="bg-blue-600 h-2.5 rounded-full" style={{ width: `${(creature.stats.hp / creature.stats.max_hp) * 100}%` }}></div>
    </div>
    <div className="text-sm">{`HP: ${creature.stats.hp}/${creature.stats.max_hp}`}</div>
    <div className="flex space-x-2 mt-2">
      <span title="Attack"><Sword size={16} /> {creature.stats.attack}</span>
      <span title="Defense"><Shield size={16} /> {creature.stats.defense}</span>
      <span title="Speed"><Zap size={16} /> {creature.stats.speed}</span>
    </div>
  </Card>
);

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-screen w-full max-w-[177.78vh] mx-auto" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      {/* HUD */}
      <Card className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div>{props.data.entities.player?.display_name}</div>
        <div>{props.data.entities.opponent?.display_name}</div>
      </Card>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-around items-center bg-green-100 p-4">
        {playerCreature && <CreatureDisplay creature={playerCreature} isPlayer={true} />}
        {opponentCreature && <CreatureDisplay creature={opponentCreature} isPlayer={false} />}
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <Card className="bg-gray-100 p-4 h-1/4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {playerCreature?.collections?.skills.map((skill) => {
              if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)) {
                return (
                  <button
                    key={skill.uid}
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                    className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
                  >
                    {skill.display_name}
                  </button>
                );
              }
              return null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded shadow">
            Waiting for your turn...
          </div>
        )}
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Modified the skill button rendering logic to map over all skills in `playerCreature.collections.skills` instead of just 'lick' and 'tackle'.
2. Adjusted the layout by reducing the height of the UI area from `h-1/3` to `h-1/4` to ensure it's always visible.
3. Reduced the size of the creature displays by changing `w-32 h-32` to `w-24 h-24` for the creature image and `p-4` to `p-2` for the card padding.
4. Ensured that only skills with UIDs present in `availableButtonSlugs` are rendered as buttons.
5. Changed the button click handler to emit the skill's UID instead of a hardcoded string.

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that all available skills are displayed and clickable, while also improving the overall layout of the game scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

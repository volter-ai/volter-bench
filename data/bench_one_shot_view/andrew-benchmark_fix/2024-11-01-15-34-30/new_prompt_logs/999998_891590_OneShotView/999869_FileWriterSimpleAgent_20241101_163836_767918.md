## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the uid prop issue and ensuring we follow all guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 0ca20414-a008-42f3-8916-ebb2417d2d4d
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center shadow-lg">
          {data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. We've kept the overall structure and functionality the same.
2. We've ensured that we're using the `data` prop directly, which includes the `uid` property. Although we're not using any custom components that require the `uid` prop in this particular scene, the `uid` is available in the `data` object if needed for future modifications.
3. We've maintained the use of Tailwind CSS for styling, creating a full-screen layout that fits a 16:9 game container.
4. We've kept the support for 'play' and 'quit' buttons, rendering them based on the `availableButtonSlugs`.
5. We've used null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.
6. We've used only the UI components that were already imported (Button from shadcn/ui).
7. We've kept the imports from lucide-react for icons.

This version adheres to all the guidelines and correctly handles the data structure provided, including the potential use of the `uid` prop if needed in future modifications or for custom components.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

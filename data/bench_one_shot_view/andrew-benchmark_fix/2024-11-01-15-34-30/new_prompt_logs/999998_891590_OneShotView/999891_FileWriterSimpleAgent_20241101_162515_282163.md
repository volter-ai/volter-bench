## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The user interface area at the bottom of the screen is empty, which means the skill buttons are not being displayed.
2. The battlefield area is taking up too much space, pushing the user interface area off-screen or making it too small to be visible.

These issues are likely causing the timeout error because the UI simulator cannot find or interact with the skill buttons, which should be present in the user interface area.

Proposed solution:

1. Adjust the layout to ensure the user interface area is visible and large enough to contain the skill buttons.
2. Modify the conditional rendering of skill buttons to ensure they are always displayed when available.
3. Add a fallback message when there are no available skills to ensure something is always rendered in the user interface area.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7c14b60c-acfd-44d9-9885-938cc5353445
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react'
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  meta: {
    creature_type: string;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

const CreatureDisplay = ({ creature, isPlayer }: { creature: Creature; isPlayer: boolean }) => (
  <Card className={`flex flex-col items-center p-2 ${isPlayer ? 'order-1' : 'order-2'}`}>
    <div className="text-lg font-bold">{creature.display_name}</div>
    <div className="w-24 h-24 bg-gray-300 rounded-full mb-2"></div>
    <div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2.5 dark:bg-gray-700">
      <div className="bg-blue-600 h-2.5 rounded-full" style={{ width: `${(creature.stats.hp / creature.stats.max_hp) * 100}%` }}></div>
    </div>
    <div className="text-sm">{`HP: ${creature.stats.hp}/${creature.stats.max_hp}`}</div>
    <div className="flex space-x-2 mt-2">
      <span title="Attack"><Sword size={16} /> {creature.stats.attack}</span>
      <span title="Defense"><Shield size={16} /> {creature.stats.defense}</span>
      <span title="Speed"><Zap size={16} /> {creature.stats.speed}</span>
    </div>
  </Card>
);

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-screen w-full max-w-[177.78vh] mx-auto" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      {/* HUD */}
      <Card className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div>{props.data.entities.player?.display_name}</div>
        <div>{props.data.entities.opponent?.display_name}</div>
      </Card>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-around items-center bg-green-100 p-4">
        {playerCreature && <CreatureDisplay creature={playerCreature} isPlayer={true} />}
        {opponentCreature && <CreatureDisplay creature={opponentCreature} isPlayer={false} />}
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <Card className="bg-gray-100 p-4 h-1/3">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {playerCreature?.collections?.skills.map((skill) => (
            <button
              key={skill.uid}
              onClick={() => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid) && emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              className={`font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded ${
                availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)
                  ? 'bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white'
                  : 'bg-gray-300 text-gray-500 cursor-not-allowed'
              }`}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
            >
              {skill.display_name}
            </button>
          ))}
        </div>
        {(!playerCreature?.collections?.skills.length || availableButtonSlugs.length === 0) && (
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded shadow">
            Waiting for your turn...
          </div>
        )}
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Increased the height of the User Interface Card from `h-1/4` to `h-1/3` to ensure it's visible and large enough.
2. Modified the skill button rendering logic to always display all skills, but disable those that are not in the `availableButtonSlugs` list.
3. Added a conditional rendering for the "Waiting for your turn..." message to display when there are no skills or no available button slugs.
4. Removed the conditional rendering around the entire skill button section to ensure it's always present.

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the skill buttons are always present and visible, allowing the UI simulator to interact with them when they become available.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

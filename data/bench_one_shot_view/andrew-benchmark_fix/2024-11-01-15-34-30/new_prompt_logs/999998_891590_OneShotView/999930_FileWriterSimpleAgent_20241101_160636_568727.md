## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuScene, addressing the issues mentioned and adhering more closely to the guidelines. Here's the updated implementation:

# Excerpt ID: b1cab398-0b9f-4c0e-b708-b954ad7bbfa2
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
    stats: Record<string, number>,
    meta: Record<string, any>,
    collections: Record<string, any>,
    uid: string,
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data, uid }: { data: GameUIData, uid: string }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        const buttonConfig = [
            { id: 'play', label: 'Play', icon: <Play className="mr-2" /> },
            { id: 'quit', label: 'Quit', icon: <X className="mr-2" /> },
        ];

        return buttonConfig.map(button => (
            availableButtonSlugs.includes(button.id) && (
                <Button
                    key={button.id}
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick(button.id)}
                    className="flex items-center justify-center"
                >
                    {button.icon}
                    {button.label}
                </Button>
            )
        ));
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] relative" key={uid}>
            <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-purple-600 to-blue-800 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    {data.display_name || "Game Title"}
                </h1>
                <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
                    {renderButtons()}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues:

1. We now pass a `uid` prop to the MainMenuSceneView component and use it as a key for the outer div.
2. We've kept the `ExamplePlayer` interface and maintained the structure of the `GameUIData` interface as provided in the original boilerplate.
3. We're using the `Button` component from shadcn UI library.
4. We've maintained the overall structure and styling from the previous version, which adheres to the 16:9 aspect ratio and responsive design requirements.
5. We're still using Tailwind CSS for styling and maintaining the layout described in the VIEW_SUMMARY.
6. We've kept the error handling for missing data (e.g., fallback for display_name).
7. We're using Lucide icons as specified.

This implementation should now correctly follow all the guidelines and requirements while maintaining the desired functionality and appearance of the main menu scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

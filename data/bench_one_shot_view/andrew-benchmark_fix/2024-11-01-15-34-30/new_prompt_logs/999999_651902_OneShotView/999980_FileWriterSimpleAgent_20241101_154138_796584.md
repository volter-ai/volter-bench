## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! Here's the corrected and improved code for the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 58d2928f-3e15-45fe-bfbf-20f763377764
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

type ButtonSlug = 'play' | 'quit';

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const getButtonIcon = (slug: ButtonSlug) => {
    switch (slug) {
      case 'play':
        return <Play className="mr-2" />;
      case 'quit':
        return <X className="mr-2" />;
    }
  }

  const gameTitle = data?.display_name || "Creature Adventure";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        {gameTitle}
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
          <button
            key={slug}
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
            className="bg-white text-blue-600 font-semibold py-2 px-6 rounded-full shadow-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition duration-300 flex items-center justify-center"
          >
            {getButtonIcon(slug as ButtonSlug)}
            {slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1)}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This corrected version includes the following improvements:

1. We've added a `uid` property to the `GameUIData` interface, as it was mentioned in the original requirements.

2. We've created a `ButtonSlug` type to improve type safety when working with button slugs.

3. We're now using optional chaining when accessing `data.display_name` to safely handle cases where data might be undefined.

4. We've simplified the props destructuring in the component function signature.

5. The `getButtonIcon` function now uses the `ButtonSlug` type, improving type safety.

6. We're using the `display_name` from the provided data for the game title, with a fallback to "Creature Adventure" if it's not available.

7. We've kept the overall structure and styling as before, which already met the requirements for layout and responsiveness.

This version of the code adheres more closely to the guidelines and provides better type safety and null checking. It still maintains the required layout and functionality for the main menu scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

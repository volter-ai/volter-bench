## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide a corrected version of the code that adheres to all the guidelines, including the use of shadcn components. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 4a1dcbda-f0fe-4ad7-b73e-eaf9902ceb51
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderButton = (slug: string, icon: React.ReactNode, text: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      return (
        <Button
          key={slug}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
          className="flex items-center justify-center"
        >
          {icon}
          <span className="ml-2">{text}</span>
        </Button>
      );
    }
    return null;
  };

  return (
    <Card className="w-full h-full bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Game Title
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {renderButton('play', <Play className="h-4 w-4" />, 'Play')}
        {renderButton('quit', <X className="h-4 w-4" />, 'Quit')}
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

This corrected version:

1. Uses shadcn components (Button and Card) instead of native HTML elements.
2. Maintains the existing imports and named exports.
3. Uses Tailwind classes for styling.
4. Implements safety checks for missing data in the button rendering logic.
5. Takes up the entire 16:9 game container with appropriate styling.
6. Includes logic to display the 'play' and 'quit' buttons when available.
7. Uses Lucide React icons as allowed.

The component doesn't use any custom UI components that would require a uid prop, so that aspect is not applicable here. The code now adheres to all the provided guidelines and should be suitable for use in the game's main menu scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the battlefield display is incorrect. The opponent's creature and status are swapped, and the player's creature and status are also swapped.
2. The skill buttons are not properly aligned and may be causing layout issues.
3. The "Back" button is missing from the UI, which might be preventing the user from navigating or completing certain actions.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Correct the layout of the battlefield display by swapping the positions of the opponent's creature and status, and the player's creature and status.
2. Adjust the skill buttons layout to ensure they are properly displayed and accessible.
3. Add the "Back" button to the UI when it's available in the `availableButtonSlugs`.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solutions:

  const player = props.data.entities.player;
  const opponent = props.data.entities.opponent;
  const playerCreature = player?.entities.active_creature;
  const opponentCreature = opponent?.entities.active_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>

              imageUrl={`/images/players/${player.uid}.png`}
              className="mb-4"
            />
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}>
              <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Attack
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}>
              <ArrowLeftRight className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Swap
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}>
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Back
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2 max-w-full">
          {playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Base Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made to resolve the issues are:

1. The layout of the battlefield display has been corrected. The opponent's creature and status are now in their correct positions (top-left and top-right), and the player's creature and status are in their correct positions (bottom-left and bottom-right).

2. The skill buttons layout has been adjusted by adding a `max-w-full` class to the container div to ensure they don't overflow the screen width.

3. The "Back" button is now included in the UI and will be displayed when it's available in the `availableButtonSlugs`.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all necessary UI elements are present and accessible, which should prevent the timeout error from occurring.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Can you please fix the following issue?

On the game screen, there are supposed to be choices allowing to the user to do the following:

[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: Remaining choices list was empty, it is possible we never received any choices or it could be another issue on the UI'}]

Error in main process: Error: [ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: Remaining choices list was empty, it is possible we never received any choices or it could be another issue on the UI
at simulateGameplay (/Users/yueranyuan/volter/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:132:23)
at async main (/Users/yueranyuan/volter/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:208:9)



It does not appear that these choices are able to be made on the screen.



This could be because they simply aren't there, or because they have somehow not rendered (off screen, invisible,

covered, etc).  Often times they might be obscured by another element, or flowing off the screen.

Thanks!!!

Please write out the complete file in the format:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.

Content: Based on the provided image, it seems that the choices (skills) are not rendering correctly. The issue might be related to the layout or the data not being passed correctly. Let's ensure that the choices are rendered properly and are visible on the screen.

Here is the complete file with some adjustments to ensure the choices are rendered correctly:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Heart, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

  const renderCreature = (creature: Creature, isPlayer: boolean) => (
    <Card className={`p-4 ${isPlayer ? 'ml-auto' : 'mr-auto'} w-1/3`}>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{creature.display_name}</h3>
      <div className="flex items-center mt-2">
        <Heart className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
        <span>{creature.stats.hp} / {creature.stats.max_hp}</span>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      <nav className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h2>
      </nav>

      <div className="flex-grow flex flex-col justify-between p-4">
        <div className="flex justify-between mb-4">
          {renderCreature(foeCreature, false)}
          {renderCreature(playerCreature, true)}
        </div>

        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-auto">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <Button
              key={skill.uid}
              onClick={() => emitThingClick(skill.uid)}
              disabled={!availableInteractiveThingIds.includes(skill.uid)}
              className="p-2 text-left"
            >
              <div className="flex items-center">
                <Swords className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
                <div>
                  <div className="font-bold">{skill.display_name}</div>
                  <div className="text-sm">{skill.description}</div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </Button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>

      {currentButtonIds.includes('tackle') && (
        <Alert className="mt-4">
          <AlertTitle>Combat Action</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>
            Use Tackle to attack your opponent!
          </AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. Removed the `@container` class from the main div as it might be causing layout issues.
2. Ensured the `grid` layout for the skills section is properly defined and visible.

This should ensure that the choices (skills) are rendered correctly and are visible on the screen. If the issue persists, it might be related to the data not being passed correctly, and further debugging would be required to ensure the data is being received and processed as expected.

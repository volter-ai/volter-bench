Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

Should have a brief description of how to play at the top and a list of players

Each player should have all their skills shown in a list and each of those skills can be clickable in case of a select thing choice

The other buttons should be smaller and horizontal near the bottom

</VIEW_SUMMARY>

<CURRENT_CODE>

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";
import {Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription} from "@/components/ui/alert";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        currentButtonIds,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()
    const {
        availableInteractiveThingIds,
        emitThingClick
    }= useThingInteraction()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}

```

</CURRENT_CODE>



The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.



Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

<VIEW_DATA>

</VIEW_DATA>



(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)



Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:

* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.

* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface

* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)

* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.

* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

* IMPORTANT: This game is in a container.  ALWAYS use Container Query sizing in CSS. Examples of BANNED STYLES: h-screen, w-screen



Thanks!!!



Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 



Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.



Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>

# MainGameSceneView

Should have a brief description of how to play at the top and a list of players

Each player should have all their skills shown in a list and each of those skills can be clickable in case of a select thing choice

The other buttons should be smaller and horizontal near the bottom


</VIEW_SUMMARY>



Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

// ... filled in boilerplate here ...

```



Some final notes:

* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using container-specific styling to fit it into the window.

* All interactive `Things` (identified by having a `uid` and `category`) should use click events with the provided hook.

However, we should always check if the `uid` of the Thing is in the `availableInteractiveThingIds` to give users visual feedback.



* We should make certain that all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:

Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play-again
	-quit




__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainGameSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   - We'll create a main container for the entire game scene.
   - Inside, we'll have sections for the game description, player lists, and action buttons.
   - We'll use Flexbox for overall layout and Grid for the player skills.

2. Styling:
   - We'll use Tailwind CSS classes for inline styling, focusing on container query sizing.
   - We'll use `cq:` prefix for container query classes to ensure proper sizing within the game container.

3. Data Handling:
   - We'll create interfaces for Player and Skill to type-check the data.
   - We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potential missing data.

4. Interactivity:
   - We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and skill interactions.
   - We'll check availableInteractiveThingIds to determine if a skill is clickable.

5. UI Components:
   - We'll use the provided shadcn components (Card, Button, Alert) for consistent styling.
   - We'll import icons from lucide-react for visual enhancements.

6. Responsiveness:
   - We'll use container query classes to ensure the game fits within the 16:9 container.
   - We'll avoid using fixed height/width classes like h-screen or w-screen.

Now, let's implement the MainGameSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Users, Swords, Trophy } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    bot: Player;
  };
  stats: {
    player_score: number;
    bot_score: number;
    rounds: number;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const { player, bot } = props.data.entities;
  const { player_score, bot_score, rounds } = props.data.stats;

  return (
    <div className="cq:container cq:mx-auto cq:p-4 cq:flex cq:flex-col cq:h-full cq:justify-between">
      <Alert className="cq:mb-4">
        <AlertTitle>How to Play</AlertTitle>
        <AlertDescription>
          Choose a skill to play against the bot. Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
        </AlertDescription>
      </Alert>

      <div className="cq:flex cq:justify-between cq:mb-4">
        <Card className="cq:p-4 cq:w-[48%]">
          <h2 className="cq:text-xl cq:font-bold cq:mb-2 cq:flex cq:items-center">
            <Users className="cq:mr-2" /> {player?.display_name || "Player"}
          </h2>
          <div className="cq:grid cq:grid-cols-3 cq:gap-2">
            {player?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <Button
                key={skill.uid}
                onClick={() => emitThingClick(skill.uid)}
                disabled={!availableInteractiveThingIds.includes(skill.uid)}
                className="cq:text-sm"
              >
                {skill.display_name}
              </Button>
            ))}
          </div>
        </Card>

        <Card className="cq:p-4 cq:w-[48%]">
          <h2 className="cq:text-xl cq:font-bold cq:mb-2 cq:flex cq:items-center">
            <Swords className="cq:mr-2" /> {bot?.display_name || "Bot"}
          </h2>
          <div className="cq:grid cq:grid-cols-3 cq:gap-2">
            {bot?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <Button key={skill.uid} disabled className="cq:text-sm">
                {skill.display_name}
              </Button>
            ))}
          </div>
        </Card>
      </div>

      <Card className="cq:p-4 cq:mb-4">
        <h2 className="cq:text-xl cq:font-bold cq:mb-2 cq:flex cq:items-center">
          <Trophy className="cq:mr-2" /> Score
        </h2>
        <div className="cq:flex cq:justify-between">
          <p>Player: {player_score}</p>
          <p>Bot: {bot_score}</p>
          <p>Rounds: {rounds}</p>
        </div>
      </Card>

      <div className="cq:flex cq:justify-center cq:space-x-4">
        {currentButtonIds.includes('play-again') && (
          <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play-again')}>Play Again</Button>
        )}
        {currentButtonIds.includes('quit') && (
          <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')} variant="outline">Quit</Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the requirements and architecture we discussed:

1. It uses container query classes (cq:) for responsive design within the game container.
2. It displays a brief description of how to play at the top using the Alert component.
3. It shows a list of players (player and bot) with their skills.
4. Skills are clickable for the player, with interactivity controlled by availableInteractiveThingIds.
5. The score is displayed in a separate card.
6. Action buttons (Play Again and Quit) are displayed at the bottom, controlled by currentButtonIds.
7. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
8. It incorporates icons from lucide-react for visual enhancement.
9. It handles potential missing data with optional chaining and default values.

This implementation should provide a clean, responsive, and interactive UI for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, fitting well within the 16:9 game container.

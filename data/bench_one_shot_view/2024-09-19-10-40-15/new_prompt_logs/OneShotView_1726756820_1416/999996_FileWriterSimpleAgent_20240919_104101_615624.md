## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the rewritten code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use flexbox to create a vertical layout with three main sections:
   - Top: Game title image
   - Middle: Empty space for potential future content
   - Bottom: Play and Quit buttons

3. Styling:
   We'll use inline Tailwind classes for styling. To ensure container query sizing, we'll use relative units and flexbox for layout. We'll avoid using fixed heights or widths.

4. Interactivity:
   We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and thing interactions.

5. Error Handling:
   We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators to handle potential missing data safely.

6. Responsiveness:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout adapts to different container sizes.

Implementation using inline Tailwind styles:

- We'll use `flex flex-col` for the main container to create a vertical layout.
- The game title will use `text-4xl font-bold text-center` for large, centered text.
- Buttons will use `mt-auto` to push them to the bottom of the container.
- We'll use `p-4` for padding and `space-y-4` for vertical spacing between elements.

Now, let's rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: f2a2f244-7ade-637c-71ee-d2ffc2da4a84
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const isButtonAvailable = (id: string) => currentButtonIds.includes(id);

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-full w-full p-4 bg-gray-100">
      <div className="flex-grow flex flex-col items-center justify-between">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center text-blue-600 mb-8">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>

        <div className="mt-auto space-y-4">
          <Button
            className="w-full"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            disabled={!isButtonAvailable('play')}
          >
            <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
          </Button>
          <Button
            className="w-full"
            variant="outline"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            disabled={!isButtonAvailable('quit')}
          >
            <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
          </Button>
        </div>
      </div>

      {props.data.entities.player && (
        <Card className="mt-4 p-4">
          <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Player Info</h2>
          <p>Name: {props.data.entities.player.display_name}</p>
          <p>Description: {props.data.entities.player.description}</p>
        </Card>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene with a title at the top and buttons at the bottom. It uses Tailwind classes for styling and layout, ensuring that the content adapts to the container size. The player information is displayed in a card at the bottom if available.

The component checks for button availability using the `currentButtonIds` and disables buttons that are not available. It also uses the `emitButtonClick` function to handle button clicks.

The layout is flexible and should work well within a 16:9 container, using relative units and flexbox for positioning. The use of `h-full` and `w-full` ensures that the component takes up the entire available space within its container.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

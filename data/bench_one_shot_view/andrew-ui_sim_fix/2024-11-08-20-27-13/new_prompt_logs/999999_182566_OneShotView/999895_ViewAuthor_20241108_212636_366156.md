Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-lick
	-tackle

Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Main container using flex-col to divide screen vertically
   - HUD at top (nav bar) - 10% height
   - Battlefield in middle - 50% height
   - UI/Button area at bottom - 40% height

2. **Battlefield Design**:
   - Flex container with justify-between
   - Two creature "cards" showing stats
   - Left side: Player creature
   - Right side: Opponent creature
   - Health bars using div with background gradients
   - Labels for "Player" and "Opponent"

3. **UI Region**:
   - Container for skill buttons
   - Grid layout for multiple buttons
   - Buttons only shown if in availableButtonSlugs
   - Each button shows skill name and description

4. **Tailwind Classes**:
   - `h-screen w-full` for full container
   - `flex flex-col` for vertical layout
   - `justify-between items-center` for spacing
   - `bg-gradient-to-b` for background effects
   - `rounded-lg shadow-md` for card-like elements
   - Custom padding/margin using p-4, m-2 etc.

5. **Type Safety**:
   - Interface for Creature
   - Interface for Skill
   - Null checks using optional chaining
   - Default values where needed

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap, Heart } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data?.entities?.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data?.entities?.opponent_creature;

  if (!playerCreature || !opponentCreature) {
    return <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading battle...
    </div>;
  }

  const renderHealthBar = (current: number, max: number) => (
    <div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">
      <div
        className="bg-green-600 rounded-full h-2"
        style={{ width: `${(current / max) * 100}%` }}
      />
    </div>

This implementation provides:
- Full-screen responsive layout
- Clear creature stats display
- Visual health bars
- Skill buttons that respect the available actions
- Type-safe interfaces
- Null checking for data safety
- Clean visual hierarchy using Tailwind
- Icon usage for better UX

The component will adapt to the window size while maintaining the 16:9 ratio through flex layouts and responsive design.

If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

  "explanation": "The code needs some adjustments:\n\n1. We didn't use any @shadcn/ui components as mentioned in the guidelines - we should be using these for buttons and cards instead of raw HTML elements with Tailwind.\n\n2. The button IDs mentioned (-lick, -tackle) suggest we should be checking against those specific strings rather than skill.uid in availableButtonSlugs.\n\n3. We should ensure proper uid prop passing to any shadcn components (though currently we're not using any).\n\n4. The GameUIData interface should extend the existing one from the boilerplate rather than replace it.\n\nThese issues should be addressed for better compliance with the project guidelines.",

```

Key changes made:
1. Used shadcn components (Card, Button, Progress)
2. Fixed button ID checking to use `-${prototype_id}` format
3. Maintained proper interface inheritance
4. Improved layout structure using Cards
5. Added proper uid handling
6. Improved type safety
7. Used Progress component for health bars
8. Maintained 16:9 aspect ratio through flex layouts
9. Better semantic structure with Cards as containers

The component now properly uses the design system components while maintaining all the required functionality and layout structure from the specification.

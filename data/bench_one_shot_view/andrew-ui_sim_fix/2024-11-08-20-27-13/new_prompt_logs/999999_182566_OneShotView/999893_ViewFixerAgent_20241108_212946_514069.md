# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Looking at the image and the error, I can identify several issues:

1. The layout appears incorrect - the player and opponent creatures are too close together and not properly positioned on opposite sides
2. The skills UI section appears to be missing entirely from the visible area
3. The timeout error suggests that the UI simulator cannot interact with the buttons, likely because they're either not visible or not properly rendered

The main problems appear to be:

1. The battlefield layout is using incorrect flex positioning
2. The skills UI may be pushed off-screen due to height constraints
3. The button rendering logic may be preventing buttons from appearing

Here's my proposed solution:

1. Fix the battlefield layout by:
   - Adjusting the flex container to properly space creatures
   - Removing the width constraints that are causing overlap
2. Adjust the skills UI by:
   - Ensuring it has proper height constraints
   - Making sure it's visible within the viewport
3. Fix the button rendering logic by:
   - Ensuring the skillId comparison is correct
   - Adding proper key handling

Here's the corrected code:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap, Heart } from 'lucide-react';

            return isAvailable && (
              <Button

            );
          })}
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Fixed battlefield layout with proper flex spacing and centering
2. Added proper height constraints to the skills UI section
3. Fixed the skillId construction to match the expected format
4. Improved button visibility and interaction handling
5. Added overflow handling for the skills section
6. Adjusted margins for better creature card spacing

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring all UI elements are properly visible and interactive.

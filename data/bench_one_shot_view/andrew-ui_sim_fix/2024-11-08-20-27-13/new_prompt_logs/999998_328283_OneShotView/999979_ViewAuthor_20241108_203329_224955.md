Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"

interface SkillButtonProps {
  uid: string
  name: string
  description: string
  stats: string
  onClick?: () => void
  disabled?: boolean
}

let SkillButtonComponent = ({
  uid,
  name,
  description,
  stats,
  onClick,
  disabled
}: SkillButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <HoverCard uid={`${uid}-hover`}>
      <HoverCardTrigger uid={`${uid}-trigger`} asChild>
        <Button
          uid={`${uid}-button`}
          variant="default"
          onClick={onClick}
          disabled={disabled}
          className="w-[200px]"
        >
          {name}
        </Button>
      </HoverCardTrigger>
      <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-content`} className="w-80">
        <div className="space-y-2">

          <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            {stats}
          </div>
        </div>
      </HoverCardContent>
    </HoverCard>
  )
}

let SkillButton = withClickable(SkillButtonComponent)

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardContent,
} from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Card> {
  uid: string
  name: string
  imageUrl: string
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-[300px]", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>

      <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
        <img

          alt={name}
          className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

  maxHp: number
  imageUrl: string
}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, hp, maxHp, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <Card uid={`${uid}-card`} ref={ref} className={cn("w-[350px]", className)} {...props}>
        <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
          <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription uid={`${uid}-description`}>HP: {hp}/{maxHp}</CardDescription>

        <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
          <img
            src={imageUrl}
            alt={name}
            className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
          />
        </CardContent>
        <CardFooter uid={`${uid}-footer`} className="flex justify-between">
        </CardFooter>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Use a flex-column layout for the entire screen (h-screen)
- Top: HUD navbar (h-16)
- Middle: Battlefield (flex-grow)
- Bottom: UI area (h-1/3)

2. Component Organization:
- Main container with flex layout
- Battlefield section with horizontal flex layout for creatures
- Skills/buttons area with grid layout
- Use custom components:
  - CreatureCard for both player and opponent creatures
  - SkillButton for skill actions
  - PlayerCard for player info if needed

3. Tailwind Styling Approach:
- Use flex layouts for positioning
- Grid for skill buttons
- Responsive sizing with relative units
- Container constraints for 16:9 aspect ratio

4. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for safety
- Implement null checks for collections

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

  return (

This implementation:
1. Creates proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Uses a full-screen flex layout
3. Implements all required sections (HUD, battlefield, UI area)
4. Uses custom components as specified
5. Handles null cases safely
6. Uses Tailwind for responsive layout
7. Maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio through container constraints
8. Uses the proper custom components with UIDs
9. Implements the battlefield with proper creature positioning
10. Shows skills in the bottom UI area

Note: You'll need to provide actual image URLs for the creatures (currently using placeholder-creature.png).

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

We're not using PlayerCard component at all, though we have player data available\n2. The imageUrl is hardcoded to \"/placeholder-creature.png\" which might cause issues\n3. We should handle the case where collections.skills might be undefined with optional chaining\n4. We should add null checks for playerCreature and foeCreature before accessing their properties\n\nThe code needs some adjustments to be fully safe and utilize all available components.",

```

Changes made:
1. Added PlayerCard components in the HUD for both player and opponent
2. Added proper null checks at the start of the component
3. Used optional chaining for skills collection
4. Added fallback UI when no skills are available
5. Changed image URLs to be dynamic based on entity UIDs
6. Destructured entities at the start for cleaner code
7. Added proper type checking for all entities
8. Maintained all required props for custom components
9. Ensured UIDs are properly passed to all custom components
10. Added proper null coalescing for skills rendering

The code now properly uses all custom components, handles null cases safely, and maintains proper TypeScript types throughout.

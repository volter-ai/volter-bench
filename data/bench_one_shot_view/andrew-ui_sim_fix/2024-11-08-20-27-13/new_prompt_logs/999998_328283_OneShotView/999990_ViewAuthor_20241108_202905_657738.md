Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"

interface SkillButtonProps {
  uid: string
  name: string
  description: string
  stats: string
  onClick?: () => void
  disabled?: boolean
}

let SkillButton = ({
  uid,
  name,
  description,
  stats,
  onClick,
  disabled
}: SkillButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <HoverCard uid={`${uid}-hover`}>
      <HoverCardTrigger uid={`${uid}-trigger`} asChild>
        <Button
          uid={`${uid}-button`}
          variant="default"
          onClick={onClick}
          disabled={disabled}
        >
          {name}
        </Button>
      </HoverCardTrigger>
      <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h4 className="text-sm font-semibold">{name}</h4>
          <p className="text-sm">{description}</p>
          <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">{stats}</div>
        </div>
      </HoverCardContent>
    </HoverCard>
  )
}

SkillButton = withClickable(SkillButton)

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardContent,
} from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Card> {
  uid: string
  name: string
  imageUrl: string
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-[300px]", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
        <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>

        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

    return (
      <Card

        {...props}
      >
        <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
          <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <img

              alt={name}
              className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
            />
            <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
              <span>HP:</span>
              <span>{hp}/{maxHp}</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Main container (full viewport, 16:9 ratio)
   - Top HUD navigation bar
   - Middle battlefield section (flex container)
   - Bottom UI section for skills/buttons

2. **Component Organization**:
   - Use custom components for entities:
     - CreatureCard for creatures
     - PlayerCard for players
     - SkillButton for skills
   - Battlefield will use flex layout to position creatures
   - Skills area will use grid layout for button arrangement

3. **Tailwind Styling Approach**:
   - Main container: `h-screen w-screen aspect-video`
   - Battlefield: `flex justify-between items-center`
   - Skills area: `grid grid-cols-4 gap-4`
   - Responsive considerations using Tailwind breakpoints

4. **Data Handling**:
   - Create interfaces for Creature, Player, and Skill types
   - Use optional chaining for safe data access
   - Handle empty states gracefully

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, User } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen aspect-video flex flex-col">
      {/* Top HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-primary/10 p-4 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <User className="w-6 h-6" />
          <span>{props.data.entities.player?.display_name}</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Sword className="w-6 h-6" />
          <Shield className="w-6 h-6" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-1 flex justify-between items-center px-8 bg-secondary/5">
        {player_creature && (

              name={player_creature.display_name}
              hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder.png"
            />
          </div>
        )}

        {foe_creature && (
          <div className="relative">
            <span className="absolute -top-8 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 text-sm font-bold">

This implementation:
1. Creates proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Uses the custom components as specified
3. Implements a responsive layout with Tailwind
4. Handles null/undefined cases safely
5. Provides visual indicators for player/opponent creatures
6. Uses the HUD for player information
7. Implements the skills area with a grid layout
8. Maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio while filling the screen

The component is structured to be maintainable and scalable, with clear separation of concerns between the battlefield and UI areas.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

CreatureCard:\n- \u2713 uid prop is passed correctly from creature.uid\n- \u2717 imageUrl is hardcoded to \"/placeholder.png\" which might not exist\n- \u2713 other props (name, hp, maxHp) are passed correctly\n\n2. SkillButton:\n- \u2713 uid prop is passed correctly from skill.uid\n- \u2713 name, description are passed correctly\n- \u2713 stats is passed as a string as required\n- \u2713 disabled prop is handled correctly with availableButtonSlugs\n\n3. PlayerCard:\n- \u2717 PlayerCard component is imported but never used, despite having player data available\n- Should show player information in the HUD instead of just text\n\nOther issues:\n- The nav bar uses raw divs instead of proper navigation components\n- Missing proper error boundaries for when data is undefined\n- Should handle the case where skills array is empty\n\nThe code needs revision to:\n1. Remove unused PlayerCard import\n2. Add proper error handling\n3. Use proper image handling\n4. Add error boundaries\n5. Handle empty states better",

Changes made:
1. Properly used PlayerCard components in the HUD
2. Added proper error handling for missing data
3. Used dynamic image URLs based on entity UIDs
4. Added empty state handling for skills
5. Removed unused imports
6. Properly structured the component hierarchy
7. Added proper null checks
8. Maintained consistent UID usage across all custom components
9. Added loading state for when data isn't available
10. Kept the 16:9 aspect ratio requirement

All custom components now receive their required UIDs from the corresponding entity data, and image URLs are structured to follow a consistent pattern based on entity UIDs. The component also handles empty or loading states appropriately.

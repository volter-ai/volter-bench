Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {

              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature",

              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {

                      "skill_type": "normal"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  },
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 2
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "lick",
                      "category": "Skill",

                    "description": "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",

              "description": "A water-type creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "A player with a Bubwool"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "ad727587-a8b0-5bad-de3c-3da9ccb39601",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (prominent)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative
     - Bottom: Button controls

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Using Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Flexbox for vertical alignment and spacing
   - Grid system for button layout
   - Maintaining 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom technique

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with background styling
   - Title section with game name
   - Button section with dynamic button rendering based on availableButtonSlugs

4. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Using emitButtonClick for button interactions
   - Conditional rendering based on availableButtonSlugs
   - Safe rendering with optional chaining

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Play, XCircle} from 'lucide-react'

interface GameStats {
    [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
    prototype_id: string;
    category: string;
    [key: string]: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
    __type: string;
    stats: GameStats;
    meta: GameMeta;
    entities: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
    __type: 'Player';
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: Player;
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return (
        <div className="relative w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
            <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                {/* Title Section */}
                <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                    <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                        {props.data?.entities?.player?.display_name || "Game Title"}
                    </h1>
                </div>

                {/* Button Section */}
                <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full max-w-md">
                    {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                        <button
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 w-full py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                        >
                            <Play className="w-6 h-6" />
                            Play Game
                        </button>
                    )}

                    {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                        <button
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 w-full py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                        >
                            <XCircle className="w-6 h-6" />
                            Quit
                        </button>
                    )}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a responsive 16:9 container using padding-bottom technique
- Uses a gradient background
- Centers the title at the top
- Places buttons at the bottom
- Includes icons from lucide-react
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Implements proper TypeScript interfaces
- Uses Tailwind for all styling
- Maintains the required exports and imports
- Checks for button availability before rendering

The buttons are styled with hover effects and proper spacing, and the layout is fully responsive while maintaining the aspect ratio.

  "explanation": "After reviewing the code, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:\n\n1. We didn't follow the pattern of passing UIDs to custom components (though we aren't using any in this case, so this isn't a blocker)\n\n2. More importantly, we're not using any shadcn components as mentioned in the guidelines. The buttons should be using the shadcn Button component which would have been imported like:\n```tsx\nimport { Button } from \"@/components/ui/button\"\n```\n\n3. The interfaces could be simplified since we're not using most of the data structure - we're only really using the player's display name.\n\n4. The gradient background might be better handled through shadcn's built-in theming system.\n\nWhile the layout and functionality is correct, we should modify the code to use the proper UI component library as specified in the requirements.",

                            variant="default"
                            size="lg"
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                            className="w-full text-xl"
                        >

                            Play Game
                        </Button>
                    )}

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added shadcn Button component import
2. Simplified interfaces to only what we need
3. Using shadcn Button component with proper variants and sizes
4. Using shadcn theme variables (bg-background, text-primary) instead of hard-coded colors
5. Maintained the 16:9 aspect ratio container
6. Kept the responsive layout and proper spacing
7. Maintained proper type safety and null checks
8. Kept the required lucide-react icons
9. Maintained the same functionality with emitButtonClick

The component now properly uses the shadcn UI library while maintaining all the required functionality and layout requirements from the original specification.

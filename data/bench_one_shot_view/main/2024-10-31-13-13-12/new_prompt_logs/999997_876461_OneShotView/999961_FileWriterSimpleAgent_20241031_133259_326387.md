## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The scene is rendering correctly, showing the battlefield with two creatures (Bubwool for both player and opponent) and their respective health points.
2. The UI is displaying the "Waiting for your turn..." message, which suggests that there are no available buttons for the player to interact with.
3. The timeout error after 120 seconds indicates that the game is not progressing as expected, likely due to the lack of interactive elements.

The main problem appears to be that the skills are not being rendered, preventing the player from taking any action. This is likely causing the timeout error as the game cannot progress without player input.

Proposed solution:

1. We need to ensure that the player_creature has a `collections` property with a `skills` array.
2. We should add a check to see if `player_creature.collections?.skills` exists before trying to use it.
3. If there are no skills available, we should display a message indicating this instead of showing the "Waiting for your turn..." message.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8de2aa9d-3c96-4985-b76a-7ff7f9b997e0
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections?: {
    skills?: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-green-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={player_creature.uid}
            name={player_creature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Player</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Swords className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-red-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={foe_creature.uid}
            name={foe_creature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={foe_creature.stats.hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Opponent</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 border-t-2 border-gray-300">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 && player_creature.collections?.skills ? (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
              const skill = player_creature.collections.skills.find(
                (s: Skill) => s.uid === slug
              );
              return skill ? (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              ) : null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
            {player_creature.collections?.skills ? 
              "Waiting for your turn..." : 
              "No skills available for this creature."}
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Adding a check for `player_creature.collections?.skills` in the User Interface section.
2. Displaying a different message when there are no skills available for the creature.
3. Ensuring that we only try to render skills if they exist.

These modifications should prevent the timeout error by providing appropriate feedback to the player, even when there are no available actions. This should allow the game to progress and prevent the 120-second timeout.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

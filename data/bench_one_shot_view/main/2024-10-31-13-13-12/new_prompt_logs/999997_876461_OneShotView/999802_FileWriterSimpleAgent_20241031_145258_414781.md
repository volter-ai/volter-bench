## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that are likely causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the creatures and their status information is incorrect. The opponent's creature (Scizard) is on the right side instead of the left, and the player's creature (Bubwool) is on the left instead of the right.

2. The health bars for both creatures are not properly aligned with their respective creature cards.

3. The skill buttons (Tackle and Lick) are not being rendered correctly. They should be using the SkillButton component, but instead appear as regular buttons.

4. The Attack and Swap buttons are using icons, which is not consistent with the other buttons in the UI.

To resolve these issues, we need to make the following changes:

1. Swap the positions of the opponent and player creatures in the grid layout.
2. Adjust the positioning and styling of the health bars to align with their respective creature cards.
3. Use the SkillButton component for rendering skill buttons instead of regular buttons.
4. Remove the icons from the Attack and Swap buttons for consistency.

Here's the implemented solution:

            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
            className="justify-self-end self-end"
          />
        )}
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-100 p-4 flex flex-col justify-center">
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 justify-center">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}>
              Attack
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}>
              Swap
            </Button>
          )}
          {playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Base Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all buttons are rendered correctly. The timeout error was likely caused by the UI not being interactive due to the misplacement of elements and incorrect button rendering. With these fixes, the UI simulator should be able to interact with the game elements properly, preventing the timeout.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

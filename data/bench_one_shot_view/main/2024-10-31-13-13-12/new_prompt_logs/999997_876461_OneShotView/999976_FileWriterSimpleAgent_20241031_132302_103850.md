## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The scene is rendering correctly, showing the battlefield with two creatures (Bubwool for both player and opponent) and their respective health points.
2. The UI is displaying the "Waiting for your turn..." message, which suggests that there are no available buttons to click.
3. The timeout error indicates that the UI simulator couldn't find any clickable elements for 120 seconds.

The main problem appears to be that the skills buttons are not being rendered, even though the code includes logic to display them. This could be causing the timeout error in the UI simulator.

Proposed solution:
1. We need to ensure that the `player_creature` object has a `collections` property with a `skills` array.
2. We should add a check to see if `player_creature.collections` and `player_creature.collections.skills` exist before trying to use them.
3. We should also add a fallback message when there are no skills available, to differentiate between waiting for a turn and having no skills.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e4270338-6ed1-4aed-be9d-42bd75b26cab
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections?: {
    skills?: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-green-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={player_creature.uid}
            name={player_creature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Player</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Swords className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-red-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={foe_creature.uid}
            name={foe_creature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={foe_creature.stats.hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Opponent</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 border-t-2 border-gray-300">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
              const skill = player_creature.collections?.skills?.find(
                (s: Skill) => s.uid === slug
              );
              return skill ? (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              ) : null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : player_creature.collections?.skills?.length > 0 ? (
          <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
            Waiting for your turn...
          </p>
        ) : (
          <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
            No skills available
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The changes made include:

1. Added an optional `collections` property to the `Creature` interface with an optional `skills` array.
2. Modified the condition in the User Interface section to check for the existence of skills:
   - If there are available button slugs, it will attempt to render the skill buttons.
   - If there are no available button slugs but the creature has skills, it will show the "Waiting for your turn..." message.
   - If there are no skills at all, it will display a "No skills available" message.

These changes should help prevent the timeout error by ensuring that there's always some content in the UI section, even when there are no skills or available buttons. It also provides more informative feedback to the user about the current state of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Within this container, we'll use flexbox to position the title at the top and the buttons at the bottom.

3. Title:
   We'll create a large, centered title using Tailwind classes for styling. Since we don't have an actual image asset, we'll use text to represent the game title.

4. Buttons:
   We'll map through the availableButtonSlugs to create buttons dynamically. Each button will use the emitButtonClick function when clicked.

5. Background:
   We'll apply a gradient background using Tailwind classes to create an attractive backdrop for the main menu.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where data might be missing.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 4f9a1f6e-1e1c-4bd2-92ac-ba7975dbdff3
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: 'Play', icon: Play },
    quit: { text: 'Quit', icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] h-full max-h-[56.25vw] flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16 mb-8">Creature Battle</h1>
        
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
            const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
            if (!config) return null;
            
            const Icon = config.icon;
            
            return (
              <button
                key={slug}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                className="bg-white text-purple-600 font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-full shadow-lg hover:bg-purple-100 transition duration-300 flex items-center space-x-2"
              >
                <Icon size={24} />
                <span>{config.text}</span>
              </button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen, responsive main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and dynamically rendered buttons at the bottom. The layout maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio and is centered within the available screen space. 

The buttons are generated based on the availableButtonSlugs, with icons and text configured for 'play' and 'quit' options. If additional button types are needed in the future, they can be easily added to the buttonConfig object.

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, creating an attractive and responsive design without the need for additional CSS files or styled components.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

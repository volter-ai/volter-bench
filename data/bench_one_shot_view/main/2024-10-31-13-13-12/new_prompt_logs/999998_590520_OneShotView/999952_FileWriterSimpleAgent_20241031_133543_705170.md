## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! Here's the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and adhering more closely to the guidelines:

# Excerpt ID: ff1ea5d7-3ae0-492d-b317-6cbb8c5a7f02
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

type ButtonSlug = 'play' | 'quit';

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderButton = (slug: ButtonSlug, icon: React.ReactNode, text: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      return (
        <button
          key={slug}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
          className="flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors"
        >
          {icon}
          <span className="ml-2">{text}</span>
        </button>
      );
    }
    return null;
  };

  const playerName = data?.entities?.player?.display_name || 'Player';

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Game Title
      </div>
      
      <div className="text-xl text-white">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {renderButton('play', <Play size={24} />, 'Play')}
        {renderButton('quit', <X size={24} />, 'Quit')}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the following points:

1. We've added more robust error handling for the GameUIData props by using optional chaining when accessing the player's display name.

2. We're now utilizing the player data passed in the props to display a welcome message with the player's name.

3. We've added a type for the button slugs (ButtonSlug) to improve type safety.

4. The component still takes up the entire 16:9 game container with appropriate styling.

5. We've kept the 'play' and 'quit' buttons as requested.

6. We're still using inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

7. We've maintained the existing imports and named exports.

8. The code doesn't use any custom UI components that would require a uid prop, but it's now prepared to handle such components if they were to be added in the future.

This version should now be compliant with the guidelines and provide a more robust implementation of the MainMenuSceneView component.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Flexbox to create a vertical layout with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom. This will be achieved using Tailwind CSS classes.

3. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Container Query sizing to ensure the component fits properly within its container, avoiding global viewport units.

4. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title as text, styled to be prominent and centered at the top of the screen.

5. Button Rendering:
   We'll map through the available button slugs and render Button components for each one, positioning them at the bottom of the screen.

6. Interactivity:
   We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and thing interactions.

7. Styling:
   We'll use inline Tailwind classes for styling, ensuring responsiveness and adhering to the container query approach.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: f2a2f244-7ade-637c-71ee-d2ffc2da4a84
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: 'Play', icon: <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
    quit: { text: 'Quit', icon: <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
  };

  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto h-full flex flex-col justify-between p-4">
      <div className="text-center">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Creature Battle Game</h1>
        <p className="text-xl">Welcome, {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || 'Player'}!</p>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
          <Button
            key={slug}
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
            className="w-48"
          >
            {buttonConfig[slug]?.icon}
            {buttonConfig[slug]?.text || slug}
          </Button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the architecture and requirements we discussed:

1. The component uses a flex layout to position the title at the top and buttons at the bottom.
2. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, avoiding any global viewport units.
3. The game title is displayed prominently at the top.
4. Buttons are rendered based on the available button slugs, with custom icons and text.
5. The component uses the provided hooks for handling button clicks.
6. Error handling is implemented with optional chaining and fallback values.
7. The layout is responsive and should fit well within a 16:9 container.

This implementation should provide a clean, responsive main menu for the game, following the specified requirements and using the available UI components.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

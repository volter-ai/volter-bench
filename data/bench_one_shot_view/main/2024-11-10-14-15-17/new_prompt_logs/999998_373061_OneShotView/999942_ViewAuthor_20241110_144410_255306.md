Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10,
                "attack": 3,
                "defense": 2,
                "speed": 4
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature with a strong tackle."
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "A player with a Bubwool"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (prominent)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative
     - Bottom: Button controls

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Using Tailwind classes for:
     - Flexbox layout (`flex`, `flex-col`)
     - Positioning (`justify-center`, `items-center`)
     - Spacing (`gap-y-8`, `p-8`)
     - Background effects (`bg-gradient-to-b`)
   - 16:9 aspect ratio maintained using `aspect-video`

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with proper game dimensions
   - Title section with game name
   - Button section with dynamic button rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`
   - Safe rendering with optional chaining

4. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Using `emitButtonClick` for button interactions
   - Conditional button rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameStats {
  [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
  prototype_id: string;
  category: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
  __type: string;
  stats: GameStats;
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
  collections: {
    creatures: BaseEntity[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
          {props.data?.entities?.player?.display_name || "Creature Game"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-4 items-center mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="flex items-center gap-x-2 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white px-8 py-3 rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
          >
            <Play size={24} />
            Play Game
          </button>
        )}

        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="flex items-center gap-x-2 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white px-8 py-3 rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
          >
            <XCircle size={24} />
            Quit
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen container with proper aspect ratio
- Uses a dark gradient background
- Centers the title at the top
- Places buttons at the bottom with proper spacing
- Includes icons from Lucide
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Provides proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
- Uses Tailwind for all styling
- Implements the required button functionality

The buttons are styled with hover effects and proper spacing, and the layout follows the traditional main menu format described in the requirements.

If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

  "explanation": "After reviewing the code against the requirements, there are a few issues:\n\n1. The code doesn't pass UIDs to any custom components, but in this case we aren't actually using any custom UI components from shadcn/ui. The requirements mentioned we should use existing shadcn components, but we opted for native buttons instead. We should modify this to use shadcn/ui Button components.\n\n2. The interfaces could be more specific - we're defining some types that might already exist elsewhere in the codebase (like BaseEntity).\n\n3. The styling is correct for 16:9 and uses Tailwind appropriately.\n\n4. The button handling and null safety is implemented correctly.\n\n5. We're missing a proper background for the main menu as mentioned in the requirements (\"The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu\").\n\nLet's mark this as not ok to use and provide an updated version that addresses these issues.",

  entities: {
    player: {

  return (

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-4 items-center mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <Button
            variant="default"
            size="lg"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="w-48 flex items-center gap-x-2"
          >
            <Play className="w-5 h-5" />
            Play Game
          </Button>
        )}

        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            variant="destructive"
            size="lg"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="w-48 flex items-center gap-x-2"
          >
            <XCircle className="w-5 h-5" />
            Quit
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Used shadcn's Button component instead of native buttons
2. Simplified the interfaces to only what's needed for this component
3. Added proper background styling with overlay gradient
4. Maintained the 16:9 aspect ratio and full-screen layout
5. Kept null safety checks and proper button handling
6. Removed unnecessary type definitions
7. Standardized button sizes and layout
8. Kept Lucide icons but adjusted their sizing to match the Button component

Note: This assumes there's a background image at "/menu-bg.jpg". The actual path should be adjusted based on your project's asset structure.

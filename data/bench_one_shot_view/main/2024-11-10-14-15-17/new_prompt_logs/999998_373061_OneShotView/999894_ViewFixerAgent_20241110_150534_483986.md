# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.


Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Problem Description:**
1. Looking at the image, the creatures' stats cards are positioned at the far edges of the screen, but there appears to be empty space in the middle.
2. The skills UI section at the bottom appears to be missing or not visible.
3. The error indicates a timeout after 120s, suggesting that the UI simulator couldn't interact with the expected elements.
4. The main issue seems to be that the button clicks aren't being registered properly, likely due to positioning issues.

**Key Issues:**
1. The battlefield layout is incorrect - creatures are pushed to the edges instead of being properly spaced
2. The skills UI might be getting cut off or rendered incorrectly
3. The button click handling may not be working correctly due to the `-` prefix in the buttonId

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Fix the battlefield layout by adjusting the flex container and spacing
2. Ensure the skills UI is properly positioned and sized
3. Remove the `-` prefix from buttonId as it might be causing issues with the click handling
4. Add proper padding and spacing to ensure all elements are visible and clickable

Here's the corrected code:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap, Heart } from 'lucide-react';
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
  meta: {
    prototype_id: string;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data?.entities?.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data?.entities?.opponent_creature;

  if (!playerCreature || !opponentCreature) {
    return <div className="aspect-video w-full flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading battle...
    </div>;
  }

  const renderHealthBar = (current: number, max: number) => (
    <div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2">
      <div
        className="bg-green-600 rounded-full h-2 transition-all duration-300"
        style={{ width: `${(current / max) * 100}%` }}
      />
    </div>
  );

  const renderCreatureStats = (creature: Creature, isPlayer: boolean) => (
    <Card className="p-4 mx-4">
      <div className={`flex flex-col ${isPlayer ? 'items-start' : 'items-end'}`}>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">{creature.display_name}</h2>
        <div className="w-full max-w-[200px]">
          {renderHealthBar(creature.stats.hp, creature.stats.max_hp)}
        </div>
        <div className="flex gap-2 mt-2">
          <div className="flex items-center">

          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center">
            <Shield className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
            {creature.stats.defense}
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center">
            <Zap className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
            {creature.stats.speed}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );

  return (
    <div className="aspect-video w-full flex flex-col bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-800">
      {/* HUD */}
      <Card className="w-full p-2 rounded-none bg-black/30">
        <div className="flex justify-between items-center px-4">
          <span className="text-white">Battle Scene</span>
          <Heart className="text-red-500" />
        </div>
      </Card>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center gap-8 px-4">
        <div className="w-1/3 flex justify-center">

        </div>
        <div className="w-1/3 flex justify-center">
          {renderCreatureStats(opponentCreature, false)}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Skills UI */}
      <Card className="min-h-[200px] bg-black/40 p-4 rounded-t-xl rounded-b-none">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => {
            const buttonId = skill.meta.prototype_id;
            return availableButtonSlugs.includes(buttonId) && (
              <Button
                key={skill.uid}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(buttonId)}
                variant="secondary"
                className="h-auto flex flex-col items-start p-4"
              >
                <h3 className="font-bold">{skill.display_name}</h3>
                <p className="text-sm opacity-80">{skill.description}</p>
                <span className="text-xs mt-1">Damage: {skill.stats.base_damage}</span>
              </Button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:
1. Adjusted the battlefield layout with proper centering and spacing
2. Removed the `-` prefix from buttonId
3. Added min-height to the skills UI to ensure it's always visible
4. Improved the creature stats card positioning with consistent margins
5. Added proper justify-center classes to ensure creatures are centered in their containers

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by making all elements properly visible and clickable for the UI simulator.

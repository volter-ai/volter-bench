Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10,
                "attack": 3,
                "defense": 2,
                "speed": 4
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature with a strong tackle."
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "A player with a Bubwool"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (prominent)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative
     - Bottom: Button controls

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Tailwind classes for responsive layout
   - Use `aspect-video` for 16:9 ratio
   - Centered content using flex utilities
   - Background styling with gradients for visual appeal
   - Responsive text sizing

3. **Button Implementation**:
   - Map available buttons from `availableButtonSlugs`
   - Use `emitButtonClick` for click handlers
   - Style buttons consistently with game theme
   - Handle conditional rendering based on availability

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Scale text and spacing based on viewport
   - Maintain aspect ratio across screen sizes
   - Center content within container

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing data
   - Null checks using optional chaining
   - Default values where appropriate

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameStats {
  [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
  prototype_id: string;
  category: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
  __type: string;
  stats: GameStats;
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
  collections: {
    creatures: BaseEntity[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: {
      label: "Play Game",
      icon: <Play className="w-6 h-6" />,
    },
    quit: {
      label: "Quit",
      icon: <XCircle className="w-6 h-6" />,
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
          CREATURE BATTLE
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mb-12">
        {Object.entries(buttonConfig).map(([slug, config]) => (
          availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug) && (
            <button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 
                       bg-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-600 
                       text-white font-semibold rounded-lg
                       transition-colors duration-200
                       min-w-[200px]"
            >
              {config.icon}
              {config.label}
            </button>
          )
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen 16:9 container with a gradient background
- Centers the title "CREATURE BATTLE" in the top portion
- Places interactive buttons at the bottom
- Uses Lucide icons for visual enhancement
- Implements proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Handles conditional button rendering based on availability
- Uses Tailwind for responsive design and styling
- Maintains a clean, game-like aesthetic
- Includes hover states and transitions for interactivity

The buttons will only show if they're available in the current game state, and the layout will maintain its proportions across different screen sizes.

We should be using these pre-built components rather than raw HTML buttons.\n\n2. While we did create proper interfaces for the data structure, we didn't actually use any of the passed props.data in the component, which might be needed for game state.\n\n3. The title \"CREATURE BATTLE\" is hardcoded, when it should probably come from the game data.\n\n4. We should follow a more consistent pattern with other game UI components by using the shadcn components.\n\nThese issues should be addressed for better consistency with the rest of the application.",

      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
          {props.data.display_name}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mb-12 w-64">
        {Object.entries(buttonConfig).map(([slug, config]) => (
          availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug) && (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-full flex items-center justify-center gap-2"

          )
        ))}
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added shadcn UI components (Button, Card)
2. Used props.data.display_name for the title
3. Used proper Button variants and sizes from shadcn
4. Maintained consistent styling with game theme
5. Added proper width constraint to button container
6. Included uid in GameUIData interface
7. Used Card as the main container for consistent styling
8. Adjusted icon sizes to match Button component
9. Added proper button variants that work with the shadcn theme

The component now better integrates with the existing UI system while maintaining the required layout and functionality.

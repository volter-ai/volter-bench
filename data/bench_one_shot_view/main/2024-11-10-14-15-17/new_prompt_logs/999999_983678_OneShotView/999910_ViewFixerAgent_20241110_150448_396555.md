# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

DIAGNOSIS:
Looking at the image and comparing it to the code, there are several issues:

1. The creature cards are positioned incorrectly - they should be on opposite sides but appear to be overlapping or misaligned
2. The skills UI section at the bottom appears to be missing or not visible
3. The timeout error suggests that the UI simulator cannot interact with the buttons, likely because they're either not rendering or not properly accessible

The main issues appear to be:
- Incorrect layout structure causing positioning problems
- The skills UI may be pushed off-screen or hidden
- Button rendering logic may be preventing buttons from appearing

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

1. Fix the layout structure:
- Adjust the battlefield flex container to properly space creatures
- Ensure creature cards have proper positioning classes
- Add proper padding/margins to prevent overlap

2. Modify the skills UI:
- Ensure it's properly positioned at the bottom
- Add proper height constraints
- Improve button rendering logic

3. Fix button visibility:
- Modify the button rendering condition
- Ensure buttons are properly accessible
- Add proper spacing in the grid

Here's the corrected code:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap, Heart } from 'lucide-react';
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 h-full">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => {
            const buttonId = `-${skill.meta.prototype_id}`;
            const isAvailable = availableButtonSlugs.includes(buttonId);
            
            return isAvailable && (
              <Button
                key={skill.uid}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(buttonId)}
                variant="secondary"
                className="h-auto flex flex-col items-start p-4"
              >
                <h3 className="font-bold">{skill.display_name}</h3>
                <p className="text-sm opacity-80">{skill.description}</p>
                <span className="text-xs">Damage: {skill.stats.base_damage}</span>
              </Button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes include:
- Fixed creature card positioning with proper width constraints and margin classes
- Improved battlefield layout with proper width distribution
- Added height constraints to the skills UI
- Improved button rendering logic and visibility
- Added proper spacing and padding throughout the component

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring all interactive elements are properly rendered and accessible.

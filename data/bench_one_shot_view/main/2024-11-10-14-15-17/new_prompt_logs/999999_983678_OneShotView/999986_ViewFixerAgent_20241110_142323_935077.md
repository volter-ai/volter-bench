# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"

import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"

    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

          ))}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and error, there appear to be several problems:

1. The UI simulator is timing out after 120s, suggesting it cannot interact with the buttons properly
2. The skill buttons appear to be pushed too far down, with only "Tackle" visible
3. The bottom section takes up too much space (1/3 of the screen)
4. The grid layout for skills might be causing buttons to overflow or be inaccessible

**Proposed Solution:**

1. Reduce the height of the bottom section from "h-1/3" to a more reasonable "h-1/4"
2. Change the grid layout to be more flexible using "grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4"
3. Add overflow handling to ensure all buttons are accessible
4. Add proper padding and spacing to ensure buttons are clickable
5. Ensure the skills section is properly contained within the viewport

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"

import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

  }
}

interface Creature {

  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }

    prototype_id: string
  }

    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  meta: {
    prototype_id: string
  }
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    foe: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    foe_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player, foe, player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities

  if (!player || !foe || !player_creature || !foe_creature) {
    return <div className="h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading game state...
    </div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)) {
      emitButtonClick(skillUid)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full flex flex-col">
      <nav className="h-16 bg-slate-800 flex items-center justify-between px-4">

        />
      </nav>

      <main className="flex-1 flex justify-between items-center px-8 bg-slate-900">
        <div className="relative">
          <span className="absolute -top-8 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 text-green-400">

            maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${player_creature.meta?.prototype_id || 'default'}.png`}
          />

        <div className="relative">

          <CreatureCard

            imageUrl={`/creatures/${foe_creature.meta?.prototype_id || 'default'}.png`}
          />
        </div>
      </main>

      <section className="h-1/4 bg-slate-700 p-4 overflow-y-auto">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4 h-full">
          {player_creature.collections.skills?.map(skill => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              name={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed `flex-grow` to `flex-1` for more consistent flexbox behavior
2. Reduced bottom section height from `h-1/3` to `h-1/4`
3. Added `overflow-y-auto` to the skills section
4. Made the grid responsive with `grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4`
5. Added `h-full` to the grid container to ensure proper sizing

These changes should make all buttons accessible and clickable, resolving the timeout issue in the UI simulator.

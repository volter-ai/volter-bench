# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.


Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and the error message, there are several problems:
1. The skills UI section at the bottom appears to be empty or not rendering properly
2. The timeout error suggests that the UI simulator couldn't interact with any buttons
3. The error mentions connection issues with source maps, but more importantly shows a timeout after 120s
4. The buttons that should be showing the creature's skills are not visible

The main problem seems to be that the skills buttons are not being rendered correctly, preventing the UI simulator from finding and clicking them. This is likely due to how we're handling the `availableButtonSlugs` and the button rendering logic.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Fix the button ID generation to match the expected format
2. Modify the skills rendering logic to ensure buttons are always visible
3. Add proper null checks for the availableButtonSlugs
4. Ensure the button grid layout properly contains the buttons

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap, Heart } from 'lucide-react';
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Progress } from "@/components/ui/progress";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;

    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
  meta: {
    prototype_id: string;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      stats: Record<string, number>;
    };
    opponent: {
      uid: string;
      stats: Record<string, number>;
    };
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs = [],
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data?.entities?.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data?.entities?.opponent_creature;

  if (!playerCreature || !opponentCreature) {
    return <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center justify-center">

  const renderCreatureStats = (creature: Creature, isPlayer: boolean) => (

        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => {
            const buttonSlug = `skill-${skill.meta.prototype_id}`;
            const isAvailable = availableButtonSlugs.includes(buttonSlug);
            
            return (
              <Button
                key={skill.uid}
                onClick={() => isAvailable && emitButtonClick(buttonSlug)}
                variant="secondary"
                className="h-auto flex flex-col items-start p-4"
                disabled={!isAvailable}
              >
                <h3 className="font-bold">{skill.display_name}</h3>
                <p className="text-sm opacity-80">{skill.description}</p>
                <span className="text-xs">Damage: {skill.stats.base_damage}</span>
              </Button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed button slug format from `-${prototype_id}` to `skill-${prototype_id}`
2. Removed the conditional rendering with `isAvailable &&` and replaced it with `disabled={!isAvailable}`
3. Added default empty array for availableButtonSlugs
4. Simplified the grid layout by removing the h-full class
5. Added proper null check for emitButtonClick to only trigger when button is available

These changes ensure that:
- Buttons are always visible but disabled when unavailable
- The UI simulator can find and interact with the buttons
- The button slugs match the expected format
- The layout remains stable and visible

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help design the architecture for this component. Here's the plan:

1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Main container div with h-screen w-screen and flex flex-col
   - Upper battlefield section (flex-grow: 2)
   - Lower UI section (flex-grow: 1)

2. **Battlefield Layout**:
   - Grid layout (grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2)
   - Each quadrant positioned using Tailwind classes
   - Creature cards will use the CreatureCard component
   - Status displays will use relative positioning

3. **UI Section**:
   - Flex container for the bottom third
   - Grid layout for buttons (grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2)
   - SkillButton components for skills

4. **Data Interfaces**:
# Excerpt ID: 93c42c4c-3653-4731-8c98-2ec430f74df2
```typescript
interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  meta: {
    creature_type: string
  }
}

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    base_damage: number
  }
  meta: {
    skill_type: string
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature
    opponent_creature: Creature
  }
}
```

5. **Styling Strategy**:
# Excerpt ID: c669cb07-6780-4a1c-9657-25916e392ba3
```typescript
// Main container
"h-screen w-screen flex flex-col"

// Battlefield
"flex-grow-2 grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4"

// UI Section
"flex-grow-1 bg-gray-100 p-4"

// Button Grid
"grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4"
```

Now I'll implement the component. Would you like me to proceed?

The component will handle null states gracefully and use the custom components as specified. We'll use the creature's prototype_id to construct image URLs (assuming they exist at `/images/creatures/{prototype_id}.png`).

Should I proceed with the implementation?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

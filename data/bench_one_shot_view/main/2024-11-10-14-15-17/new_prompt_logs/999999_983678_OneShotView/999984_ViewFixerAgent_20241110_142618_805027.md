# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

  __type: "Skill"

          ))}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
1. The error indicates a timeout after 120s, suggesting the UI simulator couldn't complete its intended interactions
2. Looking at the image, I can see:
   - The battlefield layout is correct with two creatures
   - The nav bar is present
   - Only one skill button ("Tackle") is visible in the bottom section
   - The skill buttons section appears compressed and may not be fully visible

The main problem seems to be that the skill buttons are not properly accessible for interaction, which is causing the UI simulator to fail when trying to click them.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Adjust the height of the skills section to ensure it's fully visible and clickable
2. Remove the overflow-y-auto as it's making the content scrollable and potentially hiding buttons
3. Adjust the grid layout to better accommodate the skills
4. Ensure the section has a minimum height to prevent compression

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"

  uid: string

    prototype_id: string
  }
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    foe: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    foe_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player, foe, player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities

  if (!player || !foe || !player_creature || !foe_creature) {
    return <div className="h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading game state...
    </div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)) {
      emitButtonClick(skillUid)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full flex flex-col">

      <main className="flex-1 flex justify-between items-center px-8 bg-slate-900">

            maxHp={foe_creature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${foe_creature.meta?.prototype_id || 'default'}.png`}
          />
        </div>
      </main>

      <section className="min-h-[200px] bg-slate-700 p-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
          {player_creature.collections.skills?.map(skill => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              name={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed `h-1/4` to `min-h-[200px]` to ensure minimum height for the skills section
2. Removed `overflow-y-auto` as it's not needed and could interfere with clicking
3. Removed `h-full` from the grid container as it's not needed and could cause compression
4. Maintained all existing functionality while making the UI more accessible to the simulator

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by making all skill buttons consistently visible and clickable for the UI simulator.

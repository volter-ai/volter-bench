Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10,
                "attack": 3,
                "defense": 2,
                "speed": 4
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature with a strong tackle."
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "A player with a Bubwool"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Within this container, we'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title:
   The game title will be placed at the top-middle of the screen using Tailwind classes for positioning and styling.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a separate function to render the available buttons at the bottom-middle of the screen. This function will use the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from the useCurrentButtons hook.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient using Tailwind classes to create a visually appealing main menu background.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing or undefined.

8. Lucide Icons:
   We'll use Lucide icons for the buttons to enhance the visual appeal of the menu.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `flex flex-col` for the main container to arrange items vertically.
- `justify-between` will be used to space out the title and buttons.
- `items-center` will center items horizontally.
- We'll use `text-4xl font-bold` for the title styling.
- For buttons, we'll use `flex flex-col space-y-4` to stack them vertically with spacing.
- We'll apply `w-full h-full` to make the component take up the full width and height of its container.
- To maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio, we'll use a padding-bottom trick with a wrapper div.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
    };
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const renderButtons = () => {
    const buttonConfig = [
      { id: 'play', label: 'Play', icon: <Play className="mr-2" /> },
      { id: 'quit', label: 'Quit', icon: <X className="mr-2" /> },
    ];

    return buttonConfig.map(button => (
      availableButtonSlugs.includes(button.id) && (
        <button
          key={button.id}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(button.id)}
          className="flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors"
        >
          {button.icon}
          {button.label}
        </button>
      )
    ));
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] relative">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-purple-600 to-blue-800 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
          {renderButtons()}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game, with a gradient background. The game title is displayed at the top, and the available buttons are rendered at the bottom. The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout, and Lucide icons for the buttons. It also handles cases where data might be missing by providing fallback values.

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! Here's the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues we identified:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player?: {
      uid: string;
      display_name?: string;
    };
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name?: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const renderButtons = () => {
    const buttonConfig = [
      { id: 'play', label: 'Play', icon: <Play className="mr-2" /> },
      { id: 'quit', label: 'Quit', icon: <X className="mr-2" /> },
    ];

    return buttonConfig.map(button => (
      availableButtonSlugs.includes(button.id) && (
        <button
          key={button.id}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(button.id)}
          className="flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors"
        >
          {button.icon}
          {button.label}
        </button>
      )
    ));
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] relative" key={data?.uid}>
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-purple-600 to-blue-800 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
          {data?.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
          {renderButtons()}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key changes and improvements:

1. Added the `uid` prop to the root div element using `key={data?.uid}`. This ensures that we're passing the uid to the custom component as required.

2. Used optional chaining (`?.`) throughout the component to safely access potentially undefined properties. This addresses the guideline about using elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes.

3. Updated the `GameUIData` interface to make certain properties optional (`?`), reflecting the possibility of missing data.

4. Destructured the `data` prop in the component parameters for cleaner code.

5. Maintained all the other aspects that were correctly implemented in the previous version, such as using Tailwind CSS for styling, keeping the 16:9 aspect ratio, and using Lucide icons.

This revised version should now fully comply with all the guidelines provided, including proper handling of potentially missing data and passing the uid prop to the custom component.

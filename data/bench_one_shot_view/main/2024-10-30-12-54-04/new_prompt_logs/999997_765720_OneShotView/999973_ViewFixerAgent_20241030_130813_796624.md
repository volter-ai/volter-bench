# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
  collections: {
    player_skill_queue: Skill[];
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;
  const playerSkills = props.data.collections.player_skill_queue || [];

  const getSkillByUid = (uid: string) => playerSkills.find(skill => skill.uid === uid);

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">

              if (!skill) {
                console.warn(`Skill not found for UID: ${slug}`);
                return null;
              }
              return (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              );
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (

          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed: 
Error in main process: 364 | async function main() {
365 |     try {
366 |         await Promise.race([

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Based on the image and the error message provided, it appears that the main issue is a timeout after 120 seconds. This suggests that the UI is not responding or updating as expected, which could be due to a lack of interactive elements or a problem with the game state management.

Looking at the image, we can see that the basic structure of the game scene is present, including:
1. The "Battle Arena" header
2. Two creature cards (both named "Bubwool") representing the player and opponent
3. A "Waiting for game action..." message in the lower part of the screen

The problem seems to be that there are no interactive elements (buttons) visible in the UI, which would explain why the UI simulator is unable to progress and eventually times out.

Proposed solution:
1. Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` array is being populated correctly.
2. Add a fallback UI for when there are no available buttons but the player skills exist.
3. Improve error handling and logging to help diagnose issues in the future.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
  collections: {
    player_skill_queue: Skill[];
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;
  const playerSkills = props.data.collections.player_skill_queue || [];

  const getSkillByUid = (uid: string) => playerSkills.find(skill => skill.uid === uid);

  console.log("Available button slugs:", availableButtonSlugs);
  console.log("Player skills:", playerSkills);

          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added console.log statements to help diagnose issues with `availableButtonSlugs` and `playerSkills`.
2. Modified the conditional rendering in the User Interface section:
   - Now it first checks if there are `availableButtonSlugs`.
   - If not, it checks if there are `playerSkills` and displays a message indicating that skills are available but no actions can be taken.
   - If neither condition is met, it shows the "Waiting for game action..." message.
3. Removed the check for `playerSkills.length > 0` when rendering skill buttons, as this was redundant with the `availableButtonSlugs` check.

These changes should help ensure that the UI always displays something interactive or informative, potentially resolving the timeout issue. The added logging will also help in diagnosing any future problems with the game state.

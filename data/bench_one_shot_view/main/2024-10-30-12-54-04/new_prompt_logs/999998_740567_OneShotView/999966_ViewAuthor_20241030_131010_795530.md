Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature with a strong tackle."
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "A new player starting their adventure."
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container that will house our main menu content. We'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title Display:
   We'll create a placeholder for the game title at the top of the screen using a large text element. In a real implementation, this could be replaced with an actual image asset.

4. Button Layout:
   We'll create a section at the bottom of the screen to house the game buttons. We'll use the availableButtonSlugs to dynamically render buttons based on what's available.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color to the main container to simulate a background for the main menu.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Button Interaction:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks and trigger the appropriate action.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderButton = (slug: string, icon: React.ReactNode, text: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      return (
        <button
          key={slug}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
          className="flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors"
        >
          {icon}
          <span className="ml-2">{text}</span>
        </button>
      );
    }
    return null;
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Game Title
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {renderButton('play', <Play size={24} />, 'Play')}
        {renderButton('quit', <X size={24} />, 'Quit')}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a placeholder for the game title at the top and dynamically rendered buttons at the bottom. The layout uses Tailwind CSS classes to achieve the desired look and responsiveness. The component checks for available button slugs and renders them accordingly, using Lucide React icons for visual enhancement.

The background is set to a dark gray color (bg-gray-800) to provide a simple background for the main menu. The aspect ratio is maintained using an inline style, ensuring the 16:9 ratio is preserved.

Error handling is implemented by checking for the existence of button slugs before rendering, ensuring that the component won't break if certain buttons are not available.

This implementation should provide a solid foundation for the MainMenuSceneView, adhering to the requirements and best practices you've outlined.

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! Here's the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and adhering more closely to the guidelines:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

type ButtonSlug = 'play' | 'quit';

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderButton = (slug: ButtonSlug, icon: React.ReactNode, text: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      return (
        <button
          key={slug}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
          className="flex items-center justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-600 transition-colors"
        >
          {icon}
          <span className="ml-2">{text}</span>
        </button>
      );
    }
    return null;
  };

  const playerName = data?.entities?.player?.display_name || 'Player';

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Game Title
      </div>
      
      <div className="text-xl text-white">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {renderButton('play', <Play size={24} />, 'Play')}
        {renderButton('quit', <X size={24} />, 'Quit')}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the following points:

1. We've added more robust error handling for the GameUIData props by using optional chaining when accessing the player's display name.

2. We're now utilizing the player data passed in the props to display a welcome message with the player's name.

3. We've added a type for the button slugs (ButtonSlug) to improve type safety.

4. The component still takes up the entire 16:9 game container with appropriate styling.

5. We've kept the 'play' and 'quit' buttons as requested.

6. We're still using inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

7. We've maintained the existing imports and named exports.

8. We've kept the null checks and safe rendering for the buttons.

This version should now be compliant with the guidelines and provide a more robust implementation of the MainMenuSceneView component.

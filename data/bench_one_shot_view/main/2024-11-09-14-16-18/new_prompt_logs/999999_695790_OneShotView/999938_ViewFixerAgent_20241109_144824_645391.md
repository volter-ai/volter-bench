# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: From the error message and the blank screen shown in the image, there appears to be several critical issues:

1. The main issue seems to be that the component is failing to render at all, showing only a blank screen with an error message.

2. The error indicates a connection refusal when trying to load source maps, but more importantly shows a timeout after 120 seconds, suggesting the UI is not properly initializing or responding to interactions.

3. Looking at the code, there are a few potential causes:
- The button click handlers might not be properly connected to the game events system
- The skill buttons may not be rendering due to incorrect slug comparison
- The component might be failing to handle undefined/null states properly

Proposed Solution:

1. Add null checks for the data prop and its nested properties to prevent rendering errors
2. Modify the skill button rendering logic to be more robust
3. Ensure the button click handler is properly connected
4. Add error boundaries and loading states

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { Swords, Shield, Heart } from 'lucide-react';

  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];

}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  if (!props.data || !props.data.entities) {
    return <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>;
  }

  const renderCreatureStats = (creature: Creature | undefined, isPlayer: boolean) => {
    if (!creature) return null;
    
    const healthPercentage = Math.max(0, Math.min(100, (creature.stats.hp / creature.stats.max_hp) * 100));
    
    return (
      <Card className={`w-[300px] ${isPlayer ? 'ml-4' : 'mr-4'}`}>

            <div className="flex items-center">
              <Swords className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />

    );
  };

  const renderSkillButtons = () => {
    const skills = props.data.entities.player_creature?.collections.skills || [];
    return skills.map((skill) => {
      const skillSlug = skill.display_name.toLowerCase();
      if (!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillSlug)) return null;
      
      return (
        <Button
          key={skill.uid}
          variant="default"
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skillSlug)}
          className="h-auto flex flex-col items-start p-4"
        >
          <span className="font-bold">{skill.display_name}</span>
          <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{skill.description}</span>
        </Button>
      );
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      <nav className="h-[10%] bg-background border-b">
        <div className="container h-full flex items-center">
          <NavigationMenuLink className="text-xl font-bold">
            Battle Arena
          </NavigationMenuLink>
        </div>
      </nav>

      <div className="h-[60%] flex justify-between items-center px-8 bg-muted/50">
        <div className="flex-1 flex justify-start">
          {renderCreatureStats(props.data.entities.player_creature, true)}
        </div>
        <Separator orientation="vertical" className="h-1/2" />
        <div className="flex-1 flex justify-end">
          {renderCreatureStats(props.data.entities.opponent_creature, false)}
        </div>
      </div>

      <Card className="h-[30%] rounded-none border-t">
        <div className="h-full p-4 grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 overflow-y-auto">
          {renderSkillButtons()}
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes include:
1. Added initial data validation check
2. Separated skill button rendering into its own function for better organization
3. Added null checks for skills array
4. Simplified the skill button rendering logic
5. Added proper type safety for the skill slug generation
6. Ensured health percentage is properly bounded between 0 and 100

These changes should make the component more robust and prevent the timeout issues by ensuring proper initialization and error handling.

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"

interface SkillButtonProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Button> {
  uid: string
  skillName: string
  description: string
  damage?: number
  accuracy?: number
  type?: string

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.

Content: I'll help design the architecture for this component. Here's how we'll structure it:

1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Main container div (16:9 ratio) using Tailwind's `aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9`
   - Two main sections:
     - Battlefield (upper 2/3) using `h-2/3`
     - UI Area (lower 1/3) using `h-1/3`

2. **Battlefield Grid**:
   - Use CSS Grid with `grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2` to create the four quadrants
   - Each quadrant will be positioned using Tailwind's flex utilities
   - For creature displays:
     - Use `CreatureCard` component for both player and opponent
     - Add platform/shadow effects using pseudo-elements and Tailwind

3. **UI Area**:
   - Flex container for the bottom section
   - Grid layout for buttons (2x2) when showing choices
   - Use `SkillButton` for skill displays

4. **Data Interfaces**:
```typescript
interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
    [key: string]: number
  }
  meta: {
    creature_type: string
    [key: string]: any
  }
}

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    base_damage: number
    [key: string]: number
  }
  meta: {
    skill_type: string
    [key: string]: any
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature
    opponent_creature: Creature
    [key: string]: any
  }
}
```

5. **Styling Strategy**:
```typescript
// Main container
"w-full h-full aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-100 to-blue-200"

// Battlefield
"h-2/3 grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4"

// Creature platforms
"relative before:absolute before:bottom-0 before:w-full before:h-4 before:bg-black/20 before:blur-md"

// UI Area
"h-1/3 p-4 bg-white/90 rounded-t-xl shadow-lg"
```

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the component with this architecture?

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

  "explanation": "Let me check the guidelines for custom components:\n\n1. UID Propagation:\n- The architecture mentions using CreatureCard and SkillButton but doesn't explicitly show passing the uid prop from the source data\n- We need to ensure every custom component gets the uid from its corresponding data object (e.g., creature.uid, skill.uid)\n\n2. Custom Component Usage:\n- We correctly identified using CreatureCard for `__type: \"Creature\"` data\n- We correctly identified using SkillButton for `__type: \"Skill\"` data\n- We missed using PlayerCard for `__type: \"Player\"` data which appears in the sample data\n\n3. Click Event Handling:\n- The architecture correctly avoids implementing click events as noted in guidelines\n\n4. Issues Found:\n- Missing explicit UID prop passing strategy\n- Missing PlayerCard implementation despite having player data\n- Need to ensure imageUrl prop handling for CreatureCard and PlayerCard\n\nThe architecture needs revision to explicitly handle UIDs and include PlayerCard component usage.",

This implementation:
1. Correctly passes UIDs to all custom components
2. Uses the appropriate custom components for each data type
3. Maintains proper layout structure with Tailwind
4. Handles missing data safely
5. Avoids implementing custom click handlers
6. Uses proper typing for the data structures
7. Follows the 16:9 aspect ratio requirement
8. Implements the battlefield and UI areas as specified

The image URLs are assumed to follow a convention based on prototype_id - you'll need to adjust the `getCreatureImageUrl` helper function to match your actual image path structure.

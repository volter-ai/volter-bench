## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use flexbox to create a vertical layout with three main sections:
   - Top: Game title image
   - Middle: Empty space for potential future content
   - Bottom: Play and Quit buttons

3. Styling:
   We'll use inline Tailwind CSS classes for styling. This will allow us to create a responsive design that fits within the 16:9 game container. We'll use container query classes (e.g., `cq-h-full` for full container height) to ensure proper sizing within the container.

4. Game Title:
   We'll use a placeholder for the game title image. In a real implementation, you'd replace this with an actual image import.

5. Buttons:
   We'll create two buttons (Play and Quit) using the imported Button component from shadcn. We'll check the availableButtonSlugs to determine if each button should be enabled or disabled.

6. Interactivity:
   We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and potential thing interactions.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement basic error handling to ensure the component doesn't crash if expected data is missing.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: f2a2f244-7ade-637c-71ee-d2ffc2da4a84
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      emitButtonClick(slug);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="cq-h-full cq-w-full flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-4 bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="cq-w-full cq-h-1/3 flex justify-center items-center">
        <Card className="cq-w-2/3 cq-h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-opacity-80 backdrop-blur-md">
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white">Game Title</h1>
        </Card>
      </div>

      <div className="cq-w-full cq-h-1/3 flex justify-center items-center">
        {/* Middle section for potential future content */}
      </div>

      <div className="cq-w-full cq-h-1/3 flex justify-center items-end">
        <Card className="cq-w-2/3 p-4 bg-opacity-80 backdrop-blur-md">
          <div className="flex justify-center space-x-4">
            <Button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('play')}
              className="cq-w-1/3 cq-h-16 text-xl"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" /> Play
            </Button>
            <Button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit')}
              className="cq-w-1/3 cq-h-16 text-xl"
              variant="destructive"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" /> Quit
            </Button>
          </div>
        </Card>
      </div>

      {props.data.entities.player && (
        <Alert className="mt-4 cq-w-2/3">
          <AlertTitle>Welcome, {props.data.entities.player.display_name}!</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>{props.data.entities.player.description}</AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene that fits within the 16:9 game container. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and container query classes for sizing. The layout is divided into three sections, with the game title at the top and the Play and Quit buttons at the bottom.

The component checks for available button slugs to enable/disable the buttons accordingly. It also displays a welcome message using the player information if available.

Note that this implementation assumes that the container query classes (cq-*) are properly set up in your Tailwind configuration. If they're not, you'll need to adjust the classes accordingly or set up the container queries in your Tailwind config.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?



<CURRENT_CODE>

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";
import {Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription} from "@/components/ui/alert";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()
    const {
        availableInteractiveThingIds,
        emitThingClick
    }= useThingInteraction()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}

```

</CURRENT_CODE>



The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.



Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

<VIEW_DATA>

```json

{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature with a strong tackle."
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "A player with a single Bubwool creature."
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}

```

</VIEW_DATA>



(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)



Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:

* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.

* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface

* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)

* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.

* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

* IMPORTANT: This game is in a container.  ALWAYS use Container Query sizing in CSS. Examples of BANNED STYLES: h-screen, w-screen



Thanks!!!



Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 



Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.



Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located.

</VIEW_SUMMARY>



Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

// ... filled in boilerplate here ...

```



Some final notes:

* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using container-specific styling to fit it into the window.

* All interactive `Things` (identified by having a `uid` and `category`) should use click events with the provided hook.

However, we should always check if the `uid` of the Thing is in the `availableInteractiveThingIds` to give users visual feedback.



* We should make certain that all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:

Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit




__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the rewritten code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that receives the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use flexbox to create a vertical layout with three main sections:
   - Top: Game title image
   - Middle: Empty space for potential future content
   - Bottom: Game buttons

3. Styling:
   We'll use inline Tailwind classes for styling. To ensure container query sizing, we'll use relative units and flexbox for layout. We'll avoid using fixed heights or widths.

4. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title as text using a large font size. In a real implementation, this could be replaced with an image.

5. Buttons:
   We'll create buttons for "Play" and "Quit" using the Button component from shadcn/ui. We'll check if these buttons are available using the availableButtonSlugs array.

6. Interactivity:
   We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and thing interactions.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and use optional chaining to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      emitButtonClick(slug);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="cq-h-full cq-w-full cq-flex cq-flex-col cq-justify-between cq-items-center cq-p-4 cq-bg-gray-100">
      <div className="cq-text-4xl cq-font-bold cq-text-center cq-mt-8">
        Game Title
      </div>
      
      <div className="cq-flex-grow"></div>
      
      <div className="cq-flex cq-flex-col cq-gap-4 cq-mb-8">
        <Button
          className={`cq-w-48 ${availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') ? '' : 'cq-opacity-50 cq-cursor-not-allowed'}`}
          onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
          disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('play')}
        >
          <Play className="cq-mr-2" /> Play
        </Button>
        <Button
          className={`cq-w-48 ${availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') ? '' : 'cq-opacity-50 cq-cursor-not-allowed'}`}
          onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
          disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit')}
        >
          <X className="cq-mr-2" /> Quit
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene that adheres to the requirements:

1. It uses container query sizing (cq-*) for all dimensions and spacing.
2. The game title is displayed at the top.
3. Play and Quit buttons are placed at the bottom.
4. It checks for available button slugs before enabling the buttons.
5. It uses the provided hooks for button interactions.
6. The layout is flexible and will adapt to the container size.

Note that this implementation doesn't use the GameUIData directly, as the main menu typically doesn't need to display player information. However, the interface is kept in case it's needed for future extensions.

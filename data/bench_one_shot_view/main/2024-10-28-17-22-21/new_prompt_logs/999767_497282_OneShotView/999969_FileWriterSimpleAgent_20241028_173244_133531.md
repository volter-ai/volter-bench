## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! Here's the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned:

# Excerpt ID: ea4eb67c-fe20-43aa-8ec6-204453da7ac0
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
    uid: string;
    stats: {
        stat1: number;
    };
    // Other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: Player;
        // Other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    };
    // Other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
                    <Button
                        key={slug}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                        {getButtonText(slug)}
                    </Button>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This version of the code addresses the following:

1. We've used the GameUIData interface provided in the boilerplate.
2. We've kept the Player interface as it was in the original boilerplate.
3. We've removed the display_name from the rendered title, as it's not part of the GameUIData interface. Instead, we're using a static "Game Title" text.
4. We've maintained all the other aspects of the previous implementation, including the layout, styling, and button rendering logic.

This code now adheres to all the guidelines and uses the correct interfaces while maintaining the functionality and appearance of the main menu scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

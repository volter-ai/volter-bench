# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

    creature_type: string;
  };
  skills: Skill[]; // Add this line

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues with the current implementation:

1. The main problem causing the timeout error is that the skill buttons are not being rendered. The UI is stuck in the "Waiting for action..." state, which means the `availableButtonSlugs` array is empty.

2. The creature images are not positioned correctly. They should be in opposite corners (top-right for opponent, bottom-left for player) according to the design document.

3. The CreatureCard components are not positioned correctly. They should be in the top-left for the opponent and bottom-right for the player.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. We need to ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is populated with the correct skill UIDs. We should map the player's creature skills to their UIDs and use these as the available button slugs.

2. We should adjust the positioning of the creature images and CreatureCard components to match the design document.

3. We should add a check to ensure that the player_creature and its skills exist before trying to render them.

Here's the implementation of these solutions:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

    sp_attack: number;
    sp_defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  meta: {
    creature_type: string;
  };
  skills: Skill[];
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
  meta: {
    skill_type: string;
    is_physical: boolean;
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities;

  // Map player creature skills to their UIDs for availableButtonSlugs
  const skillSlugs = player_creature?.skills.map(skill => skill.uid) || [];

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      {/* Battlefield Display */}

            {player_creature.skills.map((skill: Skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}

                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}

              >
                <div className="flex items-center">
                  {skill.meta.is_physical ? <Shield className="mr-2" /> : <Zap className="mr-2" />}
                  {skill.display_name}
                </div>
              </SkillButton>
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-lg">Waiting for action...</div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the skill buttons are rendered when the player creature and its skills are available. The positioning of the creature images and status cards has also been corrected to match the design document. Additionally, a check has been added to ensure that the player_creature and its skills exist before trying to render them, which should prevent any potential errors related to undefined properties.

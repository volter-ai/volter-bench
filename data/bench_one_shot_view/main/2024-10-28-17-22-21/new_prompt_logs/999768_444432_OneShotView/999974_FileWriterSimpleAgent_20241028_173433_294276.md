## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues with the current implementation:

1. The main problem causing the timeout error is that the skill buttons are not being rendered. The UI is stuck in the "Waiting for action..." state, which means the `availableButtonSlugs` array is empty.

2. The creature images are not positioned correctly. They should be in opposite corners (top-right for opponent, bottom-left for player) according to the design document.

3. The CreatureCard components are not positioned correctly. They should be in the top-left for the opponent and bottom-right for the player.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. We need to ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is populated with the correct skill UIDs. We should map the player's creature skills to their UIDs and use these as the available button slugs.

2. We should adjust the positioning of the creature images and CreatureCard components to match the design document.

3. We should add a check to ensure that the player_creature and its skills exist before trying to render them.

Here's the implementation of these solutions:

# Excerpt ID: b0d1f8e6-8cae-46ed-ba1a-85c7f2c4aa11
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    sp_attack: number;
    sp_defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  meta: {
    creature_type: string;
  };
  skills: Skill[];
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
  meta: {
    skill_type: string;
    is_physical: boolean;
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities;

  // Map player creature skills to their UIDs for availableButtonSlugs
  const skillSlugs = player_creature?.skills.map(skill => skill.uid) || [];

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4">
        {/* Opponent Status */}
        <div className="flex justify-start items-start">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponent_creature.uid}
            name={opponent_creature.display_name}
            image={`/images/creatures/${opponent_creature.meta.creature_type}.png`}
            hp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponent_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="flex justify-end items-start">
          <img
            src={`/images/creatures/${opponent_creature.meta.creature_type}_front.png`}
            alt={opponent_creature.display_name}
            className="w-48 h-48 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="flex justify-start items-end">

            hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-100 p-4">
        {player_creature && player_creature.skills && player_creature.skills.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {player_creature.skills.map((skill: Skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              >
                <div className="flex items-center">
                  {skill.meta.is_physical ? <Shield className="mr-2" /> : <Zap className="mr-2" />}
                  {skill.display_name}
                </div>
              </SkillButton>
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-lg">Waiting for action...</div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the skill buttons are rendered when the player creature and its skills are available. The positioning of the creature images and status cards has also been corrected to match the design document. Additionally, a check has been added to ensure that the player_creature and its skills exist before trying to render them, which should prevent any potential errors related to undefined properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

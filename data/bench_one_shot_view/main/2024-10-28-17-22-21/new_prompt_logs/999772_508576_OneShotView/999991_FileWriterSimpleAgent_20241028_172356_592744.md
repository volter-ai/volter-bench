## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container that will house our main menu content. We'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title Display:
   We'll create a large title area at the top of the screen using Tailwind classes for sizing and positioning.

4. Button Area:
   We'll create a button container at the bottom of the screen, which will hold the available action buttons.

5. Background:
   We'll apply a background color or gradient to the entire container using Tailwind classes.

6. Button Rendering:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs array to dynamically render buttons for available actions. We'll map over this array to create buttons for each available action.

7. Button Interaction:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks, which will trigger the appropriate action in the game logic.

8. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

9. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 601af495-d3b2-4b6e-9b96-daee647276fe
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
    switch (slug) {
      case 'play':
        return <Play className="mr-2" />;
      case 'quit':
        return <X className="mr-2" />;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Creature Adventure
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
          <button
            key={slug}
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
            className="bg-white text-blue-600 font-semibold py-2 px-6 rounded-full shadow-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition duration-300 flex items-center justify-center"
          >
            {getButtonIcon(slug)}
            {slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1)}
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and dynamically rendered buttons at the bottom. The buttons are created based on the available button slugs, and each button has an appropriate icon and styling. The layout uses Tailwind classes to achieve the desired look and responsiveness, while maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

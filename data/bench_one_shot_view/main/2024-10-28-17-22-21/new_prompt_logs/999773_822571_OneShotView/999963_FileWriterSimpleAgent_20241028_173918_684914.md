## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the creatures and their status cards is incorrect. The opponent's creature and status card are on the wrong sides, and the player's creature and status card are also misplaced.

2. The skill buttons (Tackle and Lick) are not properly implemented in the code. They should be using the SkillButton component, but they're not visible in the current implementation.

3. The Attack and Swap buttons are visible, but they're not properly styled or positioned according to the design document.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Rearrange the grid layout to correctly position the creatures and their status cards.
2. Implement the skill buttons using the SkillButton component and the data from the player's active creature.
3. Adjust the styling and positioning of the Attack and Swap buttons to match the design document.

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const player = props.data.entities.player;
  const opponent = props.data.entities.opponent;
  const playerCreature = player?.entities.active_creature;
  const opponentCreature = opponent?.entities.active_creature;

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen flex flex-col">

          )}
        </div>

      </div>

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}>
              <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Attack
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}>
              <Repeat className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Swap
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
        <div className="flex justify-center space-x-4">
          {playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The changes made include:

1. Corrected the layout of creatures and status cards in the battlefield display.
2. Updated the player creature image source to use a back image (`${playerCreature.uid}_back.png`).
3. Removed the 'back' button as it wasn't in the design document or the image.
4. Moved the Attack and Swap buttons above the skill buttons and adjusted their styling.
5. Implemented the skill buttons using the SkillButton component and the data from the player's active creature.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all interactive elements are properly displayed and functional, which should prevent the timeout error in the UI simulator.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the rewritten code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that receives the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use flexbox to create a vertical layout with three main sections:
   - Top: Game title image
   - Middle: Empty space for potential future content
   - Bottom: Game buttons

3. Styling:
   We'll use inline Tailwind classes for styling. To ensure container query sizing, we'll use relative units and flexbox for layout. We'll avoid using fixed heights or widths.

4. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title as text using a large font size. In a real implementation, this could be replaced with an image.

5. Buttons:
   We'll create buttons for "Play" and "Quit" using the Button component from shadcn/ui. We'll check if these buttons are available using the availableButtonSlugs array.

6. Interactivity:
   We'll use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and thing interactions.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and use optional chaining to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: f2a2f244-7ade-637c-71ee-d2ffc2da4a84
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
      emitButtonClick(slug);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="cq-h-full cq-w-full cq-flex cq-flex-col cq-justify-between cq-items-center cq-p-4 cq-bg-gray-100">
      <div className="cq-text-4xl cq-font-bold cq-text-center cq-mt-8">
        Game Title
      </div>
      
      <div className="cq-flex-grow"></div>
      
      <div className="cq-flex cq-flex-col cq-gap-4 cq-mb-8">
        <Button
          className={`cq-w-48 ${availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') ? '' : 'cq-opacity-50 cq-cursor-not-allowed'}`}
          onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
          disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('play')}
        >
          <Play className="cq-mr-2" /> Play
        </Button>
        <Button
          className={`cq-w-48 ${availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') ? '' : 'cq-opacity-50 cq-cursor-not-allowed'}`}
          onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
          disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit')}
        >
          <X className="cq-mr-2" /> Quit
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene that adheres to the requirements:

1. It uses container query sizing (cq-*) for all dimensions and spacing.
2. The game title is displayed at the top.
3. Play and Quit buttons are placed at the bottom.
4. It checks for available button slugs before enabling the buttons.
5. It uses the provided hooks for button interactions.
6. The layout is flexible and will adapt to the container size.

Note that this implementation doesn't use the GameUIData directly, as the main menu typically doesn't need to display player information. However, the interface is kept in case it's needed for future extensions.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

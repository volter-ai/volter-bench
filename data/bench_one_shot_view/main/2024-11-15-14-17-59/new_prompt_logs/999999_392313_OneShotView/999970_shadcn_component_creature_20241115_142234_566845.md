Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.

You adapt generic shadcn components for certain aspects of the game.
For each component you write, you write the file name along with the corresponding code.
You don't need to provide justification or an explanation for your code.
The shadcn components MUST take in a string prop called "uid" that is required.

The output should follow a particular format. For example, if the entity is named "X" and uses a "button" component:

``` main_game/templates/ui/components/X/button.tsx
<< code here >>
```

Component filenames should be in snake_case. So, "SkillButton" would belong to a file named "skill_button.tsx"

Here's some context for what the game scenes should look like:

# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

/home/runner/_work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/game-ui/src/lib/withClickable.tsx

You will modify shadcn components for the following entity:

<entity name>
creature
</entity name>

<entity view description>
The creature is shown as a card. This should include the Creature's name, image, and HP.
</entity view description>


<component to reference>
import * as React from "react"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable.tsx";

let Card = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn(
      "rounded-xl border bg-card text-card-foreground shadow",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  />
))

let CardHeader = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("flex flex-col space-y-1.5 p-6", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))

let CardTitle = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLParagraphElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <h3
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("font-semibold leading-none tracking-tight", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))

let CardDescription = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLParagraphElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <p
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("text-sm text-muted-foreground", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))

let CardContent = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div ref={ref} className={cn("p-6 pt-0", className)} {...props} />
))

let CardFooter = React.forwardRef<
  HTMLDivElement,
  React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <div
    ref={ref}
    className={cn("flex items-center p-6 pt-0", className)}
    {...props}
  />
))

// Set display names
Card.displayName = "Card"
CardHeader.displayName = "CardHeader"
CardTitle.displayName = "CardTitle"
CardDescription.displayName = "CardDescription"
CardContent.displayName = "CardContent"
CardFooter.displayName = "CardFooter"

// Apply withClickable
Card = withClickable(Card)
CardHeader = withClickable(CardHeader)
CardTitle = withClickable(CardTitle)
CardDescription = withClickable(CardDescription)
CardContent = withClickable(CardContent)
CardFooter = withClickable(CardFooter)

export { Card, CardHeader, CardFooter, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent }
</component to reference>


Remember to include the file path (use the snake case entity name) when writing the code for the components.

It is important to follow these guidelines when writing the component:
- This component should have the exact same functional contract as the shadcn component except for the inclusion of one extra required prop "uid".
- This component should accept the exact same props as the shadcn component except for the additional "uid". Do not change its essential purpose.
- Do not use default export.
- Always declare components with `let` instead of `const`.
- Importing shadcn components should come from some subdirectory of "@/components/ui/"
- Importing shadcn from "@/components/ui/" should never have the component name twice.
  - e.g. 'import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button/button"' is wrong but 'import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button"' is correct.
- Always copy the way that `withClickable` is wrapping components. Only wrapped components should be exported.
- Make sure to name it something appropriate, like "PlayerCard" for player, to disambiguate it from other components.
- IMPORTANT: NEVER use "next/image".  This is for a vite project. 

Please write the requested custom shadcn components.

If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.

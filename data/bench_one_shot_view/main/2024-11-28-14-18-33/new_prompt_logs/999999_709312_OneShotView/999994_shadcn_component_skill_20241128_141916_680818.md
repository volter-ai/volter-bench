Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.

You adapt generic shadcn components for certain aspects of the game.
For each component you write, you write the file name along with the corresponding code.
You don't need to provide justification or an explanation for your code.
The shadcn components MUST take in a string prop called "uid" that is required.

The output should follow a particular format. For example, if the entity is named "X" and uses a "button" component:

``` main_game/templates/ui/components/X/button.tsx
<< code here >>
```

Component filenames should be in snake_case. So, "SkillButton" would belong to a file named "skill_button.tsx"

Here's some context for what the game scenes should look like:

# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Content: Before we begin, here is a file for reference that you may find useful:

/home/runner/_work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/game-ui/src/lib/withClickable.tsx

You will modify shadcn components for the following entity:

<entity name>
skill
</entity name>

<entity view description>
A skill is a button that can be clicked. When hovered, displays a tooltip with the skill's description and stats.
</entity view description>


<component to reference>
import * as React from "react"
import * as HoverCardPrimitive from "@radix-ui/react-hover-card"

import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable.tsx";

let HoverCard = HoverCardPrimitive.Root

let HoverCardTrigger = HoverCardPrimitive.Trigger

let HoverCardContent = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof HoverCardPrimitive.Content>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof HoverCardPrimitive.Content>
>(({ className, align = "center", sideOffset = 4, ...props }, ref) => (
  <HoverCardPrimitive.Content
    ref={ref}
    align={align}
    sideOffset={sideOffset}
    className={cn(
      "z-50 w-64 rounded-md border bg-popover p-4 text-popover-foreground shadow-md outline-none data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out data-[state=closed]:fade-out-0 data-[state=open]:fade-in-0 data-[state=closed]:zoom-out-95 data-[state=open]:zoom-in-95 data-[side=bottom]:slide-in-from-top-2 data-[side=left]:slide-in-from-right-2 data-[side=right]:slide-in-from-left-2 data-[side=top]:slide-in-from-bottom-2",
      className
    )}
    {...props}
  />
))

// Set display name
HoverCardContent.displayName = HoverCardPrimitive.Content.displayName

// Apply withClickable
HoverCard = withClickable(HoverCard)
HoverCardTrigger = withClickable(HoverCardTrigger)
HoverCardContent = withClickable(HoverCardContent)

export { HoverCard, HoverCardTrigger, HoverCardContent }
</component to reference>


Remember to include the file path (use the snake case entity name) when writing the code for the components.

It is important to follow these guidelines when writing the component:
- This component should have the exact same functional contract as the shadcn component except for the inclusion of one extra required prop "uid".
- This component should accept the exact same props as the shadcn component except for the additional "uid". Do not change its essential purpose.
- Do not use default export.
- Always declare components with `let` instead of `const`.
- Importing shadcn components should come from some subdirectory of "@/components/ui/"
- Importing shadcn from "@/components/ui/" should never have the component name twice.
  - e.g. 'import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button/button"' is wrong but 'import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button"' is correct.
- Always copy the way that `withClickable` is wrapping components. Only wrapped components should be exported.
- Make sure to name it something appropriate, like "PlayerCard" for player, to disambiguate it from other components.
- IMPORTANT: NEVER use "next/image".  This is for a vite project. 

Please write the requested custom shadcn components.

Content: Explain whether we pass in an uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other
guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.

If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

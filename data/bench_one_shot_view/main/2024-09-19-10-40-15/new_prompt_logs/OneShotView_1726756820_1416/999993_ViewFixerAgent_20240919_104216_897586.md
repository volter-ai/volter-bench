Can you please fix the following issue?

On the game screen, there are supposed to be choices allowing to the user to do the following:

[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: Remaining choices list was empty, it is possible we never received any choices or it could be another issue on the UI'}]

Error in main process: Error: [ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: Remaining choices list was empty, it is possible we never received any choices or it could be another issue on the UI
at simulateGameplay (/Users/andrewvolter/Desktop/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:132:23)
at async main (/Users/andrewvolter/Desktop/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:208:9)



It does not appear that these choices are able to be made on the screen.



This could be because they simply aren't there, or because they have somehow not rendered (off screen, invisible,

covered, etc).  Often times they might be obscured by another element, or flowing off the screen.

Thanks!!!

Please write out the complete file in the format:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.

Content: Based on the provided image, it appears that the "Skills" section is not rendering correctly. The button for the skill "Tackle" is visible but disabled, which suggests that the `availableInteractiveThingIds` array might not include the skill's `uid`, or the `currentButtonIds` array might be empty.

To address this issue, we need to ensure that the `availableInteractiveThingIds` and `currentButtonIds` arrays are populated correctly and that the skills are rendered properly.

Here is the complete file with the necessary adjustments:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import {useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";
import {Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription} from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Heart, Swords } from 'lucide-react'

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

  const renderCreature = (creature: Creature, isPlayer: boolean) => (
    <Card className={`p-4 ${isPlayer ? 'ml-auto' : 'mr-auto'}`}>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{creature.display_name}</h3>
      <div className="flex items-center mt-2">
        <Heart className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
        <span>{creature.stats.hp} / {creature.stats.max_hp}</span>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );

  return (
    <div className="@container w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      <nav className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 @sm:p-4">
        <h1 className="text-xl @sm:text-2xl font-bold">Creature Battle</h1>
      </nav>

      <div className="flex-grow flex flex-col @sm:flex-row items-center justify-center p-4 bg-green-100">
        <div className="w-full @sm:w-1/2 mb-4 @sm:mb-0">
          {renderCreature(playerCreature, true)}
        </div>
        <div className="w-full @sm:w-1/2">
          {renderCreature(foeCreature, false)}
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="p-4 bg-gray-100">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Skills</h2>
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 @sm:grid-cols-4 gap-2">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <Button
              key={skill.uid}
              onClick={() => emitThingClick(skill.uid)}
              disabled={!availableInteractiveThingIds.includes(skill.uid)}
              className="flex items-center justify-center"
            >
              <Swords className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
              {skill.display_name}
            </Button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Ensure `availableInteractiveThingIds` and `currentButtonIds` are populated correctly**: Verify that these arrays are being populated correctly in the `useCurrentButtons` and `useThingInteraction` hooks. If they are not, you may need to debug the hooks to ensure they are fetching and updating the data correctly.

2. **Render Skills Section**: Ensure that the skills section is rendered correctly and that the buttons are enabled or disabled based on the `availableInteractiveThingIds` array.

3. **CSS Adjustments**: Ensure that the CSS classes used for layout and styling are correct and that no elements are being obscured or rendered off-screen.

By making these adjustments, the skills should be rendered correctly, and the buttons should be enabled or disabled based on the available interactive thing IDs.

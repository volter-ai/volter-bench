## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the issues and follows the guidelines more closely. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 53a756a2-9b7c-4802-862e-309847944d20
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name?: string;
  description?: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player?: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name?: string;
  description?: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name ?? "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <Card className="w-full h-1/3 flex items-center justify-center bg-opacity-20">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white text-center">
          {props.data.display_name ?? "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </Card>

      <div className="text-xl text-white mb-8">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </Button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This updated version addresses the previous issues:

1. We're now using the `Button` and `Card` components from @shadcn/ui.
2. We've expanded the `GameUIData` interface to more closely match the provided boilerplate, including all the fields that were originally present.
3. We've added more null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.
4. While we don't have custom components that require a `uid` prop in this scene, the code is now structured to accommodate such components if they were to be added.
5. We're using the `display_name` from the main data object for the game title, with a fallback.

This version maintains the overall structure and styling of the main menu while adhering more closely to the provided guidelines and using the specified UI components.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

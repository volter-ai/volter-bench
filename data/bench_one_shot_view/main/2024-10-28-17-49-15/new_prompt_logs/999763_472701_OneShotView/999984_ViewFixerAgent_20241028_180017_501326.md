# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities;

  const getSkillByUid = (uid: string) => {
    return player_creature?.collections.skills.find(skill => skill.uid === uid);
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">

        <div className="flex items-center">
          <span>Opponent</span>
          <Swords className="ml-2" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <CreatureCard
          uid={player_creature?.uid ?? ""}
          name={player_creature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={player_creature?.stats.hp ?? 0}

          className="transform scale-x-[-1]"
        />
        <CreatureCard
          uid={foe_creature?.uid ?? ""}
          name={foe_creature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"

          maxHp={foe_creature?.stats.max_hp ?? 0}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((skillUid) => {
              const skill = getSkillByUid(skillUid);
              return skill ? (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skillUid)}
                />
              ) : null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
            No skills available. Waiting for game action...
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The main problem appears to be that no skills are available, as indicated by the message "No skills available. Waiting for game action..." This suggests that the `availableButtonSlugs` array is empty, which could prevent any interaction with the game.

2. The creature names and health points are displayed incorrectly. The player's creature name is upside down, and the HP values are not formatted properly.

3. The creature images are not visible, which might be due to incorrect image paths or missing images.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Add a check to ensure that `player_creature` and its skills are properly loaded before rendering the skill buttons.
2. Correct the display of creature names and health points.
3. Update the image paths for the creatures to use a more reliable source.
4. Add error handling to prevent the component from breaking if data is missing.

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities;

  const getSkillByUid = (uid: string) => {
    return player_creature?.collections.skills.find(skill => skill.uid === uid);
  };

  const renderCreatureCard = (creature: Creature | undefined, isPlayer: boolean) => {
    if (!creature) return null;
    return (
      <CreatureCard
        uid={creature.uid}
        name={creature.display_name}
        imageUrl={`/creatures/${creature.uid}.png`}
        hp={creature.stats.hp}
        maxHp={creature.stats.max_hp}
        className={isPlayer ? "transform scale-x-[-1]" : ""}
      />
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">

        <div className="flex items-center">

          <Swords className="ml-2" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        {renderCreatureCard(player_creature, true)}
        {renderCreatureCard(foe_creature, false)}
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        {player_creature && player_creature.collections.skills.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((skillUid) => {
              const skill = getSkillByUid(skillUid);
              return skill ? (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skillUid)}
                />
              ) : null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <p className="text-center text-gray-600">
            No skills available. Waiting for game action...
          </p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes address the identified issues:

1. We now check if `player_creature` and its skills exist before rendering the skill buttons.
2. The creature names and health points display has been corrected by using the `CreatureCard` component consistently.
3. The image paths have been updated to use a more specific path (`/creatures/${creature.uid}.png`), which should be more reliable.
4. Error handling has been added by using optional chaining and null checks throughout the component.

These modifications should resolve the timeout error by ensuring that the component renders correctly even when data is missing or skills are not available. The UI should now be more robust and interactive, allowing the game simulation to progress.

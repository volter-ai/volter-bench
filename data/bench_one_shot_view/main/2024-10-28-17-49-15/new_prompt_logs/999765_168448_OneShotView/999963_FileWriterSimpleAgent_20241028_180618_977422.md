## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the battlefield display is incorrect. The player and opponent creatures are in the wrong positions according to the design document.
2. The skill buttons (Tackle and Lick) are not being properly generated from the player creature's skills.
3. The "Back" button is missing from the UI, which should be available according to the code.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Rearrange the grid layout to match the design document's specifications.
2. Ensure that the skill buttons are properly generated from the player creature's skills.
3. Add a condition to display the "Back" button when it's available.

Here's the implemented solution:

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (

              <Repeat className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Swap
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}>
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Back
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2">
          {playerCreature?.collections?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Base Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.display_name.toLowerCase())}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The changes made include:

1. Rearranging the battlefield display grid to match the design document. The opponent's creature is now in the top-right, the opponent's status in the top-left, the player's creature in the bottom-right, and the player's status in the bottom-left.

2. The skill buttons generation remains the same, as it was already correctly implemented. The issue in the image might be due to the data not being properly passed or the skills not being present in the creature's collections.

3. The "Back" button is already implemented correctly in the code. Its visibility depends on whether 'back' is included in the `availableButtonSlugs` array.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all elements are displayed correctly. The timeout error might have been caused by the incorrect layout preventing proper interaction with the UI elements. If the error persists, further investigation into the data being passed to the component and the `useCurrentButtons` hook might be necessary.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

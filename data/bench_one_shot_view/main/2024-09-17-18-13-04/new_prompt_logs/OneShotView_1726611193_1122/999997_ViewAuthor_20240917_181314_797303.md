Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

Should have a big title and vertical centered buttons

</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?



<CURRENT_CODE>

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";
import {Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription} from "@/components/ui/alert";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        currentButtonIds,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()
    const {
        availableInteractiveThingIds,
        emitThingClick
    }= useThingInteraction()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}

```

</CURRENT_CODE>



The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.



Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

<VIEW_DATA>

```json

{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "skills": [
            {
              "__type": "Skill",
              "stats": {},
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "rock",
                "category": "Skill"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {},
              "uid": "9ac4799b-f12b-2cae-faa6-642612061720",
              "display_name": "Rock",
              "description": "Rock beats Scissors"
            },
            {
              "__type": "Skill",
              "stats": {},
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "paper",
                "category": "Skill"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {},
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Paper",
              "description": "Paper beats Rock"
            },
            {
              "__type": "Skill",
              "stats": {},
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "scissors",
                "category": "Skill"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {},
              "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
              "display_name": "Scissors",
              "description": "Scissors beats Paper"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Player",
        "description": "A player in the rock-paper-scissors game"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "ad727587-a8b0-5bad-de3c-3da9ccb39601",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}

```

</VIEW_DATA>



(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)



Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:

* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.

* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface

* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)

* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.

* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

* IMPORTANT: This game is in a container.  ALWAYS use Container Query sizing in CSS. Examples of BANNED STYLES: h-screen, w-screen



Thanks!!!



Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 



Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.



Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>

# MainMenuSceneView

Should have a big title and vertical centered buttons


</VIEW_SUMMARY>



Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

// ... filled in boilerplate here ...

```



Some final notes:

* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using container-specific styling to fit it into the window.

* All interactive `Things` (identified by having a `uid` and `category`) should use click events with the provided hook.

However, we should always check if the `uid` of the Thing is in the `availableInteractiveThingIds` to give users visual feedback.



* We should make certain that all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:

Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit




__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed requirements and context. I'll outline the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   - We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView.
   - The component will use the provided hooks (useCurrentButtons and useThingInteraction) to handle button clicks and thing interactions.

2. Layout:
   - We'll use a flex container to center the content vertically and horizontally.
   - The layout will be responsive using Container Query sizing.

3. Title:
   - We'll create a large title at the top of the menu using appropriate typography styles.

4. Buttons:
   - We'll create vertical buttons for "Play" and "Quit" options.
   - The buttons will be conditionally rendered based on their availability in currentButtonIds.
   - We'll use the Button component from shadcn for consistency.

5. Styling:
   - We'll use inline Tailwind styles to achieve the desired layout and appearance.
   - We'll ensure the game takes up the entire 16:9 game container using container query classes.

6. Error Handling:
   - We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle potential missing data.

7. Interactions:
   - We'll use the emitButtonClick function for button interactions.
   - We'll check availableInteractiveThingIds before allowing interactions with Things.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: {
    prototype_id: string;
    category: string;
  };
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: {
    prototype_id: string;
    category: string;
  };
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const handleButtonClick = (buttonId: string) => {
    if (currentButtonIds.includes(buttonId)) {
      emitButtonClick(buttonId);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="@container w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-4">
      <Card className="@lg:w-3/4 @md:w-5/6 @sm:w-11/12 max-w-2xl bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-md rounded-xl shadow-xl p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl @lg:text-6xl font-bold text-center mb-8">
          {props.data.display_name || "Main Menu"}
        </h1>
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
          {currentButtonIds.includes('play') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
              className="py-3 text-xl flex items-center justify-center"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
            </Button>
          )}
          {currentButtonIds.includes('quit') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
              variant="destructive"
              className="py-3 text-xl flex items-center justify-center"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" /> Quit
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
      </Card>
      {props.data.entities.player && availableInteractiveThingIds.includes(props.data.entities.player.uid) && (
        <Alert className="mt-8 @lg:w-3/4 @md:w-5/6 @sm:w-11/12 max-w-2xl">
          <AlertTitle>Player Information</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>
            {props.data.entities.player.display_name}: {props.data.entities.player.description}
          </AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the requirements and architecture outlined earlier. It creates a responsive main menu with a title and vertical buttons, using Container Query sizing for responsiveness. The component handles button interactions based on their availability and includes error handling for missing data. The layout is centered and takes up the entire 16:9 game container using Tailwind classes.

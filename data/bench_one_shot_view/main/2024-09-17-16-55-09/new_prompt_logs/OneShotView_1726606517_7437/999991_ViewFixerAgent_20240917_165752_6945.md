Can you please fix the following issue?

On the game screen, there are supposed to be choices allowing to the user to do the following:

[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: [CHOICE 0: Button(Play)] on the UI'}]

Error in main process: Error: [ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: [CHOICE 0: Button(Play)] on the UI
at simulateGameplay (/Users/yueranyuan/volter/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:132:23)
at async main (/Users/yueranyuan/volter/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:208:9)



It does not appear that these choices are able to be made on the screen.



This could be because they simply aren't there, or because they have somehow not rendered (off screen, invisible,

covered, etc).  Often times they might be obscured by another element, or flowing off the screen.

Thanks!!!

Please write out the complete file in the format:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.

Content: Based on the provided image, it appears that the buttons are correctly rendered and visible on the screen. However, the error message suggests that the choices are not being recognized or selected. This could be due to the buttons being disabled or not having the correct identifiers.

To ensure the buttons are enabled and can be interacted with, we need to verify that `currentButtonIds` includes the necessary button IDs (`play` and `quit`). Additionally, we should ensure that the buttons have the correct identifiers for the UI simulator to recognize them.

Let's update the code to include some debugging information and ensure the buttons are enabled when they should be.

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const handleButtonClick = (buttonId: string) => {
    if (currentButtonIds.includes(buttonId)) {
      emitButtonClick(buttonId);
    } else {
      console.warn(`Button with ID ${buttonId} is not enabled.`);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-full w-full p-4 bg-gray-100">
      <div className="flex-grow flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Game Title</h1>
        <Card className="w-full max-w-md p-6 bg-white shadow-lg">
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <Button
              id="play-button"
              className="w-full"
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
              disabled={!currentButtonIds.includes('play')}
            >
              <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
            </Button>
            <Button
              id="quit-button"
              className="w-full"
              variant="outline"
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
              disabled={!currentButtonIds.includes('quit')}
            >
              <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
            </Button>
          </div>
        </Card>
      </div>
      {props.data.entities.player && (
        <Alert className="mt-4">
          <AlertTitle>Welcome, {props.data.entities.player.display_name}!</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>{props.data.entities.player.description}</AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added `id` attributes to the `Button` components to ensure they can be uniquely identified.
2. Added a console warning in `handleButtonClick` to log when a button is not enabled.

This should help in debugging the issue by ensuring the buttons are correctly identified and checking if they are enabled when clicked. If the issue persists, further investigation into the `useCurrentButtons` hook and the `currentButtonIds` array may be necessary.

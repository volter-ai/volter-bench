## Proposed Code Change
Based on the provided image, it appears that the buttons are correctly rendered and visible on the screen. However, the error message suggests that the choices are not being recognized or selected. This could be due to the buttons being disabled or not having the correct identifiers.

To ensure the buttons are enabled and can be interacted with, we need to verify that `currentButtonIds` includes the necessary button IDs (`play` and `quit`). Additionally, we should ensure that the buttons have the correct identifiers for the UI simulator to recognize them.

Let's update the code to include some debugging information and ensure the buttons are enabled when they should be.

# Excerpt ID: d6c51fe6-bb15-c25d-c44e-31c44302fcc4
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const handleButtonClick = (buttonId: string) => {
    if (currentButtonIds.includes(buttonId)) {
      emitButtonClick(buttonId);
    } else {
      console.warn(`Button with ID ${buttonId} is not enabled.`);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-full w-full p-4 bg-gray-100">
      <div className="flex-grow flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-center mb-8">Game Title</h1>
        <Card className="w-full max-w-md p-6 bg-white shadow-lg">
          <div className="space-y-4">
            <Button
              id="play-button"
              className="w-full"
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
              disabled={!currentButtonIds.includes('play')}
            >
              <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
            </Button>
            <Button
              id="quit-button"
              className="w-full"
              variant="outline"
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
              disabled={!currentButtonIds.includes('quit')}
            >
              <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
            </Button>
          </div>
        </Card>
      </div>
      {props.data.entities.player && (
        <Alert className="mt-4">
          <AlertTitle>Welcome, {props.data.entities.player.display_name}!</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>{props.data.entities.player.description}</AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added `id` attributes to the `Button` components to ensure they can be uniquely identified.
2. Added a console warning in `handleButtonClick` to log when a button is not enabled.

This should help in debugging the issue by ensuring the buttons are correctly identified and checking if they are enabled when clicked. If the issue persists, further investigation into the `useCurrentButtons` hook and the `currentButtonIds` array may be necessary.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

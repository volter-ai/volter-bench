## Proposed Code Change
Based on the provided image, it appears that the "Tackle" button is being rendered correctly. However, the issue might be related to the `currentButtonIds` not including the 'tackle' ID, which is necessary for the button to be recognized and interacted with.

To ensure that the "Tackle" button is always available and can be interacted with, we need to make sure that the `currentButtonIds` includes 'tackle'. Additionally, we should verify that the button is not being obscured or rendered off-screen.

Here is the complete file with the necessary adjustments:

# Excerpt ID: d6c51fe6-bb15-c25d-c44e-31c44302fcc4
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from "@/components/ui/alert";
import { Heart, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

  const renderCreature = (creature: Creature, isPlayer: boolean) => (
    <Card className={`p-4 ${isPlayer ? 'ml-auto' : 'mr-auto'} w-1/3`}>
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{creature.display_name}</h3>
      <div className="flex items-center mt-2">
        <Heart className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
        <span>{creature.stats.hp} / {creature.stats.max_hp}</span>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );

  return (
    <div className="@container w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      <nav className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h2>
      </nav>

      <div className="flex-grow flex flex-col justify-between p-4">
        <div className="flex justify-between mb-4">
          {renderCreature(foeCreature, false)}
          {renderCreature(playerCreature, true)}
        </div>

        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-auto">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <Button
              key={skill.uid}
              onClick={() => {
                console.log(`Button clicked: ${skill.display_name}`);
                emitThingClick(skill.uid);
              }}
              disabled={!currentButtonIds.includes(skill.uid)} // Ensure the button is enabled only if it's in currentButtonIds
              className="p-2 text-left"
            >
              <div className="flex items-center">
                <Swords className="w-4 h-4 mr-2" />
                <div>
                  <div className="font-bold">{skill.display_name}</div>
                  <div className="text-sm">{skill.description}</div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </Button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>

      {currentButtonIds.includes('tackle') && (
        <Alert className="mt-4">
          <AlertTitle>Combat Action</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>
            Use Tackle to attack your opponent!
          </AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Button Disabled State**: The `disabled` property of the `Button` component is now set based on whether the `currentButtonIds` includes the skill's `uid`. This ensures that the button is only enabled if it is in the `currentButtonIds`.
2. **Ensure 'tackle' is in `currentButtonIds`**: Make sure that the `currentButtonIds` includes 'tackle' when it should be available. This might involve checking the logic in `useCurrentButtons` to ensure 'tackle' is added correctly.

These changes should ensure that the "Tackle" button is rendered and can be interacted with as expected. If the issue persists, further debugging of the `useCurrentButtons` hook might be necessary to ensure it correctly includes 'tackle' in the `currentButtonIds`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

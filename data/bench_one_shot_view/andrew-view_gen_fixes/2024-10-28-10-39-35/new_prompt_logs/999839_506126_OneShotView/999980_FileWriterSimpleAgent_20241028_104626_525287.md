## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and following the guidelines more closely.

# Excerpt ID: b7ee0af8-89fa-41cd-90ea-2cee52597984
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// You can change this import:
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: 'Play', icon: Play },
    quit: { text: 'Quit', icon: X },
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mt-16">{props.data.display_name || 'Main Menu'}</h1>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig]
          if (!config) return null
          
          return (
            <button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="bg-white text-blue-600 font-semibold py-2 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center space-x-2 hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors"
            >
              <config.icon size={24} />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </button>
          )
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned:

1. We've kept the original imports and exports as instructed.
2. We're now using the `props.data.display_name` for the title, with a fallback to 'Main Menu' if it's not available.
3. We're still using Tailwind CSS for styling as no specific shadcn components were mentioned as required for this view.
4. We've maintained the structure of the GameUIData interface and are using it in the component props.
5. We've kept the dynamic button rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`.

The component now better adheres to the guidelines while maintaining the requested layout and functionality of the main menu scene. It uses inline Tailwind styles to create the described view with a prominent title at the top and buttons at the bottom.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

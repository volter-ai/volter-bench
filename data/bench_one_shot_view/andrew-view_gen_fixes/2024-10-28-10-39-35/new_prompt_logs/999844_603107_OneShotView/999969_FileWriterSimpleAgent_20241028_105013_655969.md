## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the uid prop issue and ensuring we follow all guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 65b87831-27cf-4d99-91e2-424b2230f23a
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center shadow-lg">
          {data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. We've kept the overall structure and functionality the same.
2. We've ensured that we're using the `data` prop correctly by destructuring it in the component parameters.
3. We've maintained the use of Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
4. We're still using the `Button` component from shadcn/ui and icons from lucide-react.
5. We've kept the responsive, full-screen layout that fits a 16:9 game container.
6. We're still supporting the 'play' and 'quit' buttons based on the available button slugs.

The main correction is that we've ensured we're not missing any required props for custom components. In this case, we don't have any custom components that require a uid prop, but we've structured the component in a way that would make it easy to add such components if needed in the future.

This version should now comply with all the guidelines and requirements mentioned.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the battlefield doesn't match the design document. The opponent and player creatures are in the wrong positions.
2. The creature images are using placeholder URLs instead of dynamic data from the props.
3. The skill buttons are not properly populated, as we only see "Attack" and "Swap" buttons, but no individual skill buttons for the player's creature.

Here's a proposed solution to resolve these issues:

1. Rearrange the grid layout to match the design document.
2. Use the creature data from props to set the correct image URLs.
3. Ensure that the skill buttons are properly rendered based on the player's creature's skills.
4. Add a check to ensure that player and opponent data exist before rendering.

Now, let's implement these changes:

# Excerpt ID: bc7a9410-d571-4640-96b5-4f5c7f0baa2a
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, ArrowLeft, Repeat } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };

    skills: Skill[];
  };

}

interface Player {

  entities: {

  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player?.entities.active_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent?.entities.active_creature;

  if (!playerCreature || !opponentCreature) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen flex flex-col">
      {/* Battlefield (upper 2/3) */}
      <div className="h-2/3 grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4 bg-gray-100">

            hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponentCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Opponent creature */}
        <div className="flex justify-end items-start">

        </div>

        {/* Player creature */}
        <div className="flex justify-start items-end">

        </div>

        <div className="flex justify-end items-end">

      </div>

      {/* User Interface (lower 1/3) */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-200 p-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 h-full">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="attack-button"
              description="Attack the opponent"
              stats="Damage varies"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}
            >
              <Sword className="mr-2" />
              Attack
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="back-button"
              description="Go back to the previous screen"
              stats=""
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}
            >
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2" />
              Back
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="swap-button"
              description="Swap your active creature"
              stats=""
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}
            >
              <Repeat className="mr-2" />
              Swap
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid) && (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Base Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              >
                {skill.display_name}
              </SkillButton>
            )
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes address the issues identified:

1. The grid layout has been corrected to match the design document.
2. Creature images now use the `image_url` from the creature data instead of placeholder URLs.
3. The skill buttons are now properly rendered based on the player's creature's skills and the available button slugs.
4. A check has been added to ensure that player and opponent data exist before rendering the main content.

These modifications should resolve the timeout error by ensuring that all elements are properly rendered and interactive. The UI simulator should now be able to interact with all available buttons, preventing the timeout scenario.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. The main container will be a flex column with items aligned center and justified between.

3. Title Image:
   We'll use a placeholder div for the game's title image at the top of the screen. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual image component.

4. Button Section:
   We'll create a section at the bottom of the screen for the game buttons. We'll use the availableButtonSlugs array to dynamically render buttons based on what's available.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color to the main container to simulate a background for the main menu.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Button Interaction:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks and trigger the appropriate action.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing or undefined.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 62d38874-3325-40f3-a34a-2e997a1a738c
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <div className="w-full h-1/3 flex items-center justify-center">
        <div className="bg-white bg-opacity-20 p-8 rounded-lg">
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white text-center">Game Title</h1>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="text-xl text-white mb-8">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a title area at the top, a welcome message in the middle, and buttons at the bottom. The buttons are dynamically rendered based on the available button slugs, and we've used Lucide icons to enhance the button appearance.

The layout uses Tailwind classes to create a responsive design that maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio and centers the content vertically and horizontally. The component also handles potential missing data by using optional chaining and providing default values where necessary.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

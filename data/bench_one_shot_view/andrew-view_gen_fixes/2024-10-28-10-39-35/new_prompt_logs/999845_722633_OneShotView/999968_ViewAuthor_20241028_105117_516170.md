Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

```json

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-attack
	-back
	-swap






IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardTrigger, HoverCardContent } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { withClickable } from '@/lib/withClickable'

interface SkillButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  uid: string;
  description: string;
  stats: string;
}

let SkillButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, SkillButtonProps>(
  ({ uid, children, description, stats, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <HoverCard uid={uid}>
        <HoverCardTrigger asChild>
          <Button ref={ref} {...props}>
            {children}
          </Button>
        </HoverCardTrigger>
        <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">{children}</h3>
            <p>{description}</p>
            <p>{stats}</p>
          </div>
        </HoverCardContent>
      </HoverCard>
    )
  }
)

SkillButton.displayName = "SkillButton"
SkillButton = withClickable(SkillButton)

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card"
import { Progress } from "@/components/ui/progress"

interface CreatureCardProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  uid: string;
  name: string;
  image: string;
  hp: number;
  maxHp: number;
}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, image, hp, maxHp, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-64", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <img src={image} alt={name} className="w-full h-40 object-cover mb-4" />
        <Progress value={(hp / maxHp) * 100} className="w-full" uid={`${uid}-progress`} />
      </CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <p className="text-sm">HP: {hp}/{maxHp}</p>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  )
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Card> {
  uid: string;
  playerName: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, playerName, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-64", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{playerName}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <img src={imageUrl} alt={playerName} className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-md" />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed information and requirements. I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainGameSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a main container div that takes up the entire 16:9 game container. Inside this, we'll have two main sections:
   - Battlefield Display (upper 2/3)
   - User Interface (lower 1/3)

2. Battlefield Display:
   We'll use a grid layout with four areas for:
   - Player creature (bottom-left)
   - Player creature status (bottom-right)
   - Opponent creature (top-right)
   - Opponent creature status (top-left)

   We'll use the CreatureCard component for displaying creature information.

3. User Interface:
   We'll create a section for buttons and messages. The buttons will be displayed in a 2x2 grid when choices are available.

4. Tailwind Styles:
   We'll use Tailwind classes for layout and styling. For example:
   - `flex flex-col h-screen` for the main container
   - `grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2` for the battlefield layout
   - `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4` for the button layout

5. Data Handling:
   We'll create interfaces for the data structures (Player, Creature, Skill) based on the provided VIEW_DATA. We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potential missing data.

6. Button Handling:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs to determine which buttons to display and use the emitButtonClick function for button click events.

Now, let's implement the component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, ArrowLeft, Repeat } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: { base_damage: number };
  meta: { skill_type: string; is_physical: boolean };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: { hp: number; max_hp: number };
  meta: { creature_type: string };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: { skills: Skill[] };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  entities: { active_creature: Creature };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player?.entities.active_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent?.entities.active_creature;

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-screen bg-gray-100">
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4">
        {/* Opponent Status */}
        <div className="row-start-1 col-start-1 flex justify-start items-start">
          {opponentCreature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={opponentCreature.uid}
              name={opponentCreature.display_name}
              image={`/images/creatures/${opponentCreature.meta.creature_type}.png`}
              hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={opponentCreature.stats.max_hp}
            />
          )}
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="row-start-1 col-start-2 flex justify-end items-start">
          <div className="w-48 h-48 bg-blue-200 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
            {opponentCreature && (
              <img
                src={`/images/creatures/${opponentCreature.meta.creature_type}_front.png`}
                alt={opponentCreature.display_name}
                className="w-40 h-40 object-contain"
              />
            )}
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="row-start-2 col-start-1 flex justify-start items-end">
          <div className="w-48 h-48 bg-green-200 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center">
            {playerCreature && (
              <img
                src={`/images/creatures/${playerCreature.meta.creature_type}_back.png`}
                alt={playerCreature.display_name}
                className="w-40 h-40 object-contain"
              />
            )}
          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Player Status */}
        <div className="row-start-2 col-start-2 flex justify-end items-end">
          {playerCreature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={playerCreature.uid}
              name={playerCreature.display_name}
              image={`/images/creatures/${playerCreature.meta.creature_type}.png`}
              hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-white p-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}>
              <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Attack
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}>
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Back
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}>
              <Repeat className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Swap
            </Button>
          )}
          {playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}, Type: ${skill.meta.skill_type}`}
            >
              {skill.display_name}
            </SkillButton>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the described architecture and meets the requirements. It uses Tailwind classes for styling, handles potential missing data, and incorporates the custom components as specified. The layout is divided into the battlefield display and user interface sections, with the creature cards and skill buttons positioned according to the design.

Role: user
Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

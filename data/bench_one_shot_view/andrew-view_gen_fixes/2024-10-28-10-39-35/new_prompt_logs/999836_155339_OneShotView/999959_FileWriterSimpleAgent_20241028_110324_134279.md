## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the creatures and their status cards is incorrect. The opponent's creature and status card are on the wrong sides, and the same goes for the player's creature and status card.

2. The creature images are too small, which might make them difficult to interact with.

3. The skill buttons for the player's creature skills are not being rendered correctly.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Swap the positions of the opponent's and player's creatures and status cards to match the design document.
2. Increase the size of the creature images to make them more visible and easier to interact with.
3. Ensure that the player's creature skills are being rendered correctly by mapping over them only if they exist.

Here's the implementation of these solutions:

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <SkillButton

              stats="Damage varies"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}
            >

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="back-button"
              description="Go back to the previous screen"
              stats=""
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}
            >
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2" />

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="swap-button"
              description="Swap your active creature"
              stats=""
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}
            >
              <Repeat className="mr-2" />
              Swap
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid) && (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Base Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              >
                {skill.display_name}
              </SkillButton>
            )
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Swapped the positions of the opponent's and player's creatures and status cards in the grid layout.
2. Increased the size of the creature images from `w-32 h-32` to `w-48 h-48` to make them more visible and easier to interact with.
3. Added a check to only render skill buttons for skills that are in the `availableButtonSlugs` array.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all interactive elements are properly rendered and accessible, which should prevent the timeout error from occurring.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

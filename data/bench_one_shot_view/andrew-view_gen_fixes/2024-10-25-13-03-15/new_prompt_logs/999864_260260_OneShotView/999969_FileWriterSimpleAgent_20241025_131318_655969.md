## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned earlier. Here's the updated implementation:

# Excerpt ID: d922e215-71a8-4808-b18e-6a9cc0924a45
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
    };
  };
  uid: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] aspect-video bg-black bg-opacity-50 text-white p-8 flex flex-col justify-between" id={data.uid}>
        <div className="text-center">
          <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-4">Creature Battle Game</h1>
          <p className="text-xl">Welcome, {playerName}!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="w-48 mb-4"
              variant="default"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" />
              Play Game
            </Button>
          )}
          
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="w-48"
              variant="destructive"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" />
              Quit Game
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This updated version addresses the following:

1. We've imported the Button component from "@/components/ui/button", which is assumed to be a custom UI component from shadcn/ui.

2. We've added a uid property to the GameUIData interface and used it as an id attribute on the main container div. This ensures that we're using the uid prop passed to the component.

3. We've replaced the custom button implementations with the imported Button component, which is assumed to have 'default' and 'destructive' variants.

4. We've kept the overall structure and styling of the component, maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio and full-screen layout.

5. We've maintained the use of availableButtonSlugs to conditionally render buttons and emitButtonClick for handling button clicks.

6. The component still uses Tailwind CSS for styling and incorporates Lucide React icons.

7. We've kept the null checks and default rendering for potentially missing data (e.g., player name).

This implementation now adheres to all the guidelines provided, including the use of custom UI components and passing of the uid prop.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the uid prop issue and ensuring we follow all guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 008a8a3c-ee75-4628-8361-618700cdb4f7
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center shadow-lg">
          {data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. We've kept the overall structure and functionality the same.
2. We've ensured that we're not using any custom components that would require a uid prop. If we were to use such components in the future, we would pass the `data.uid` as a prop to them.
3. We've maintained the use of Tailwind CSS for styling, creating a full-screen layout that fits a 16:9 game container.
4. We've kept the support for 'play' and 'quit' buttons, rendering them based on the availableButtonSlugs.
5. We've used null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.
6. We've kept the existing imports and named exports as they were.
7. We're using the Button component from shadcn/ui and icons from lucide-react.

This implementation should now correctly follow all the guidelines provided.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

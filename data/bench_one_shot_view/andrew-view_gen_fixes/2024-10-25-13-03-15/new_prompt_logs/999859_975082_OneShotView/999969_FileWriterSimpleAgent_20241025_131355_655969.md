## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the issues mentioned and adheres more closely to the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: d0579bd6-60f1-459a-be64-f74f09385c2a
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
    };
  };
  uid: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <Card className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] aspect-video bg-black bg-opacity-50 text-white p-8 flex flex-col justify-between" uid={data.uid}>
        <div className="text-center">
          <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-4">Creature Battle Game</h1>
          <p className="text-xl">Welcome, {playerName}!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="w-48 mb-4"
              uid={`${data.uid}-play-button`}
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" />
              Play Game
            </Button>
          )}
          
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="w-48"
              variant="destructive"
              uid={`${data.uid}-quit-button`}
            >
              <X className="mr-2" />
              Quit Game
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This updated version addresses the following:

1. We've added imports for shadcn components (Button and Card).
2. We've used the Card component as the main container and Button components for the actions.
3. We've added a uid property to the GameUIData interface and passed it to the custom components.
4. We've kept the overall structure and Tailwind CSS styling similar to the previous version, but now incorporating shadcn components.
5. We've maintained the use of elvis operators for safe data access.
6. We've kept the lucide-react icon imports and usage.
7. The component still implements the full-screen 16:9 aspect ratio layout as described.
8. We've retained the dynamic rendering of 'play' and 'quit' buttons based on availableButtonSlugs.

This version should now adhere more closely to the guidelines while maintaining the required functionality and layout.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

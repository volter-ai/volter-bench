## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the battlefield display doesn't match the design document. The opponent's creature and status are on the right side instead of the left.
2. The user interface area is not properly sized and positioned. It should occupy the lower 1/3 of the screen, but it appears to be smaller.
3. The "Back" button is missing from the user interface, which should be present according to the code.
4. The buttons in the user interface are not arranged in a 2x2 grid as specified in the design document.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Swap the positions of the opponent's and player's elements in the battlefield display.
2. Adjust the sizing and positioning of the user interface area.
3. Ensure that all buttons, including the "Back" button, are rendered when their corresponding slugs are available.
4. Rearrange the buttons in the user interface to form a 2x2 grid.

Here's the implementation of these solutions:

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="attack-button"
              description="Attack the opponent"
              stats="Damage varies"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}
            >
              <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="swap-button"
              description="Swap your active creature"
              stats="N/A"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}
            >
              <Repeat className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
              Swap
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="back-button"
              description="Go back to the previous screen"
              stats="N/A"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}
            >
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
              Back
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {/* Empty div to maintain 2x2 grid */}
          <div></div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Adjusted the height of the battlefield display to `h-2/3` and the user interface to `h-1/3` to ensure proper sizing.
2. Removed the `flex-grow` class from the battlefield display to prevent it from expanding beyond its allocated space.
3. Ensured that all buttons are rendered when their corresponding slugs are available in `availableButtonSlugs`.
4. Maintained the 2x2 grid layout in the user interface area.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all elements are visible and properly positioned, which should prevent the timeout error caused by the UI simulator not being able to interact with the expected elements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the battlefield display doesn't match the design document. The player and opponent creatures are in the wrong positions.
2. The user interface area is not properly sized and positioned.
3. The buttons in the user interface are not arranged in a 2x2 grid as specified.
4. The "Back" button is missing from the UI, which might be preventing the user from navigating or completing certain actions.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Rearrange the grid layout for the battlefield display to match the design document.
2. Adjust the sizing and positioning of the user interface area.
3. Implement a 2x2 grid layout for the buttons in the user interface.
4. Add the "Back" button to the UI if it's available in the `availableButtonSlugs`.

Here's the implementation of these solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 1a31e09b-46f5-49a3-bf2c-222a98b9b9a9
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, ArrowLeft, Repeat } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };

  };
}

interface Player {

  };
}

interface GameUIData {

  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const player = props.data.entities.player;
  const opponent = props.data.entities.opponent;
  const playerCreature = player?.entities.active_creature;
  const opponentCreature = opponent?.entities.active_creature;

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col h-screen bg-gray-100">
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4">
        {/* Opponent Status */}
        <div className="row-start-1 col-start-1 flex items-start justify-start">

            <PlayerCard
              uid={opponent.uid}
              playerName={opponent.display_name}
              imageUrl={`/images/players/${opponent.uid}.png`}
            />
          )}
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="row-start-1 col-start-2 flex items-start justify-end">
          {opponentCreature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={opponentCreature.uid}
              name={opponentCreature.display_name}
              image={`/images/creatures/${opponentCreature.meta.creature_type}_front.png`}
              hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={opponentCreature.stats.max_hp}
            />
          )}
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="row-start-2 col-start-1 flex items-end justify-start">
          {playerCreature && (

              hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
            />
          )}
        </div>

        {/* Player Status */}
        <div className="row-start-2 col-start-2 flex items-end justify-end">
          {player && (
            <PlayerCard

              imageUrl={`/images/players/${player.uid}.png`}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-white p-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 h-full">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="attack-button"
              description="Attack the opponent"
              stats="Damage varies"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')}
            >
              <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
              Attack
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="swap-button"
              description="Swap your active creature"
              stats="N/A"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}
            >
              <Repeat className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
              Swap
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="back-button"
              description="Go back to the previous screen"
              stats="N/A"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}
            >
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
              Back
            </SkillButton>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

These changes should resolve the issues and make the component match the design document more closely. The battlefield display is now correctly arranged, the user interface area is properly sized, and the buttons are in a 2x2 grid layout. The "Back" button is also included if it's available in the `availableButtonSlugs`. These improvements should help prevent the timeout error by ensuring all elements are visible and interactive as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide the corrected code for the MainGameScene component, addressing the issues mentioned and making better use of the available components and data.

# Excerpt ID: 3e38f8ae-f7b5-4e8a-acb2-5ba038cc056c
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;
  const player = props.data.entities.player;
  const foe = props.data.entities.foe;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <Shield className="mr-2" />
          <PlayerCard
            uid={player.uid}
            playerName={player.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/player-images/${player.uid}.jpg`}
            className="w-auto h-8"
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <PlayerCard
            uid={foe.uid}
            playerName={foe.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/player-images/${foe.uid}.jpg`}
            className="w-auto h-8"
          />
          <Swords className="ml-2" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <span className="mb-2 text-blue-600 font-bold">Player</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/creature-images/${playerCreature.uid}.jpg`}
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <span className="mb-2 text-red-600 font-bold">Opponent</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={foeCreature.uid}
            name={foeCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/creature-images/${foeCreature.uid}.jpg`}
            hp={foeCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 border-t-2 border-gray-300">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 overflow-y-auto bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">
          {/* Game text would go here */}
          <p>Battle in progress...</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. I've added the PlayerCard component to display player information in the HUD. The PlayerCards are now used for both the player and the opponent, replacing the simple text display.

2. I've updated the image URLs for both CreatureCards and PlayerCards to use dynamic paths based on their UIDs. This assumes that you have a consistent naming convention for your image files (e.g., `/creature-images/{creature_uid}.jpg` and `/player-images/{player_uid}.jpg`). You may need to adjust these paths according to your actual image storage structure.

3. All custom components (CreatureCard, SkillButton, and PlayerCard) now correctly receive the `uid` prop from the relevant data objects.

4. The component structure and layout remain the same, maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio and the required sections (HUD, Battlefield, and User Interface).

5. We're still not implementing click events for these components, as per the instructions.

6. We're using the custom components only when we have the appropriate data with a UID.

This revised version should now fully comply with the requirements and make better use of the available components and data.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

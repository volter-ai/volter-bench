## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the issues mentioned and adheres more closely to the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 34661512-2c1f-4a76-94a8-740e1406056a
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
    };
  };
  uid: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <Card className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] aspect-video bg-black bg-opacity-50 text-white p-8 flex flex-col justify-between" uid={data.uid}>
        <div className="text-center">
          <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mb-4">Creature Battle Game</h1>
          <p className="text-xl">Welcome, {playerName}!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="w-48 mb-4"
              uid={`${data.uid}-play-button`}
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" />
              Play Game
            </Button>
          )}
          
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <Button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="w-48"
              variant="destructive"
              uid={`${data.uid}-quit-button`}
            >
              <X className="mr-2" />
              Quit Game
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This updated version addresses the following:

1. We've added imports for shadcn components (Button and Card).
2. The GameUIData interface now includes a uid property.
3. We're using the Card component from shadcn as the main container, passing the data.uid as the uid prop.
4. We're using the Button component from shadcn for both the "Play" and "Quit" buttons, passing unique uid props to each.
5. We've maintained the use of Tailwind CSS for styling and layout.
6. We've kept the safe access to potentially missing data using the elvis operator.
7. The component still implements the required layout and functionality as described in the original requirements.

This version should now adhere to all the guidelines and use the available shadcn components while maintaining the required functionality and layout.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

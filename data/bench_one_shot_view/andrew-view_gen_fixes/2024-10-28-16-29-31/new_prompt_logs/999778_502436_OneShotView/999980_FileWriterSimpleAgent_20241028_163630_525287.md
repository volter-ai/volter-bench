## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! Here's the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned:

# Excerpt ID: 9d0fe58d-de10-49a1-8cb5-70e1f4079303
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      stats: Record<string, number>;
      meta: Record<string, any>;
      entities: Record<string, any>;
      collections: Record<string, any>;
      display_name: string;
      description: string;
    }
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data, uid }: { data: GameUIData; uid: string }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
    switch (slug) {
      case 'play':
        return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
      case 'quit':
        return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  };

  const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
    return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
      <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
        {data?.display_name || "Game Title"}
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
          <Button
            key={slug}
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
            className="w-48"
          >
            {getButtonIcon(slug)}
            {getButtonText(slug)}
          </Button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added the `uid` prop to the component props, following the guideline to always pass a uid prop to custom components.

2. Simplified the `GameUIData` interface by including all necessary types within it, rather than creating separate interfaces.

3. Used optional chaining (`data?.display_name`) to safely access potentially undefined properties.

4. Adjusted the main container's classes to use `w-full h-full` instead of `min-h-screen` to better fit within the 16:9 game container.

5. Kept the rest of the implementation the same, as it already followed most of the guidelines and requirements.

This version of the code should now fully comply with all the given guidelines and requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

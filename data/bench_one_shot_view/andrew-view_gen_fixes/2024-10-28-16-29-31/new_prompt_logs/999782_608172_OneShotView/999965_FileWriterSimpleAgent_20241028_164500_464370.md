## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the creatures and player cards doesn't match the design document description. The opponent's creature should be in the top-right, but it's in the top-left in the image.

2. The skill buttons in the UI area don't match the skills defined in the code. The image shows "Tackle", "Lick", and "Swap", but the code is set up to display "Attack", "Back", and "Swap".

3. The creature images are not being displayed correctly, which might be due to incorrect image paths or missing images.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Adjust the grid layout to correctly position the opponent and player creatures and status cards.
2. Update the skill button rendering to match the available skills for the active creature.
3. Ensure the creature images are being loaded correctly by adjusting the image path construction.

Here's the implemented solution:

              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack', { skillId: skill.uid })}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack')}
            >
              <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
              {skill.display_name}
            </SkillButton>
          ))}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid={`${player?.uid}-swap-button`}
              skillName="Swap"
              description="Swap your active creature"

              Swap
            </SkillButton>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Updated the grid layout to correctly position the opponent's creature in the top-right corner.
2. Modified the skill button rendering to display all skills from the active creature, but only enable them if 'attack' is in the available button slugs.
3. Adjusted the `getCreatureImage` function to use a more specific path that includes a 'creatures' subdirectory.
4. Removed the 'Back' button as it's not shown in the image and may not be needed in this context.
5. Ensured that the 'Swap' button is only rendered when it's available in the button slugs.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and make sure that the UI elements match what's expected based on the game state. The timeout error was likely caused by the UI not properly reflecting the game state, preventing the simulator from interacting with the correct elements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Based on the image and the provided code, there are a few issues with the current implementation of the MainGameSceneView:

1. The creature images are not correctly positioned. The player's creature should be in the bottom-left corner, and the opponent's creature should be in the top-right corner.
2. The creature status cards are not correctly positioned. The player's status should be in the bottom-right corner, and the opponent's status should be in the top-left corner.
3. The creature images are using placeholder images instead of the actual creature images.
4. The battle start message is displayed at the bottom of the screen, which is not mentioned in the design document.

To resolve these issues, we need to make the following changes:

1. Swap the positions of the creature images and status cards to match the design document.
2. Use the correct image sources for the creatures instead of placeholders.
3. Remove the battle start message as it's not part of the design document.

Here's the implemented solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9dfff5ad-3eac-4b25-bbd3-fc20ab73ddd8
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

}

interface Skill {

  stats: {

    skill_type: string;

}

interface Player {

}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2">
        {/* Opponent Creature Status */}
        <div className="flex items-start justify-start p-4">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponent_creature.uid}
            name={opponent_creature.display_name}
            image={`/creatures/${opponent_creature.uid}.png`}
            hp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponent_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="flex items-start justify-end p-4">
          <img 
            src={`/creatures/${opponent_creature.uid}.png`}
            alt={opponent_creature.display_name} 
            className="w-48 h-48 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="flex items-end justify-start p-4">

            alt={player_creature.display_name} 
            className="w-48 h-48 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature Status */}
        <div className="flex items-end justify-end p-4">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={player_creature.uid}
            name={player_creature.display_name}
            image={`/creatures/${player_creature.uid}.png`}
            hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-100 p-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={slug}
                uid={slug}
                skillName={slug}
                description="Skill description"
                stats="Skill stats"
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">Waiting for opponent's move...</p>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes should resolve the issues and make the MainGameSceneView match the design document more closely. The creature images and status cards are now correctly positioned, and the placeholder images have been replaced with dynamic image sources based on the creature's UID. The battle start message has been removed as it wasn't part of the original design.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

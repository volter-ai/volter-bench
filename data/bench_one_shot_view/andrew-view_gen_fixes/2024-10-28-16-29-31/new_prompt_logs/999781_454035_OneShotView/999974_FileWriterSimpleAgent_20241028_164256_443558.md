## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues with the current implementation:

1. The creature images are not positioned correctly. They should be in the opposite corners (player creature in bottom-left, opponent creature in top-right).
2. The creature status cards are not positioned correctly. They should be adjacent to their respective creatures.
3. The user interface area at the bottom is not showing any buttons, only a waiting message.
4. The aspect ratio of the game scene doesn't seem to match the 16:9 ratio specified in the code.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Swap the positions of the player and opponent creature images.
2. Adjust the positioning of the creature status cards to be next to their respective creatures.
3. Ensure that the availableButtonSlugs are being properly populated and rendered.
4. Adjust the layout to better fit the 16:9 aspect ratio.

Here's the implemented solution:

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2">
        {/* Opponent Creature Status */}
        <div className="flex items-start justify-start p-4">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponent_creature.uid}
            name={opponent_creature.display_name}
            image="/placeholder-opponent.png"
            hp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponent_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="flex items-start justify-end p-4">
          <img 
            src="/placeholder-opponent.png" 
            alt={opponent_creature.display_name} 
            className="w-48 h-48 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="flex items-end justify-start p-4">
          <img

            alt={player_creature.display_name} 
            className="w-48 h-48 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature Status */}
        <div className="flex items-end justify-end p-4">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={player_creature.uid}
            name={player_creature.display_name}
            image="/placeholder-player.png"
            hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-100 p-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={slug}
                uid={slug}
                skillName={slug}
                description="Skill description"
                stats="Skill stats"
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
            <p className="text-xl font-semibold">Waiting for opponent's move...</p>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Repositioned the player and opponent creature images to the correct corners.
2. Adjusted the positioning of the creature status cards to be adjacent to their respective creatures.
3. Kept the existing logic for rendering buttons or the waiting message, as the issue might be related to the `availableButtonSlugs` not being populated correctly.
4. Maintained the aspect ratio setting, but adjusted the layout to better fit the 16:9 ratio.

These changes should resolve the visual issues and improve the overall layout of the game scene. The timeout error might be related to the `availableButtonSlugs` not being populated, which is likely an issue with the data being passed to the component rather than the component itself. Ensure that the `useCurrentButtons` hook is working correctly and populating the `availableButtonSlugs` array.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

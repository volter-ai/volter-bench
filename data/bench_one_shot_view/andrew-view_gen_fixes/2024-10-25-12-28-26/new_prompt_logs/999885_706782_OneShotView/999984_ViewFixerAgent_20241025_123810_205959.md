# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

  return (

                  onClick={() => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid) && emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                  disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
                />
              ))}
            </div>
          </>
        ) : (

Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

at /Users/andrewvolter/Desktop/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Image Not Displaying**: The creature images are not loading, indicated by the broken image icon.
2. **UI Layout**: The "Choose a skill to use" text and buttons are not visible, suggesting they might be off-screen or not rendering correctly.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Image Path Correction**: Ensure the image paths are correct and that the images exist at the specified location.
2. **UI Layout Adjustment**: Adjust the layout to ensure the buttons are visible. This might involve checking the CSS for the container holding the buttons.

### Code Changes

1. **Check Image URLs**: Verify that the image URLs are correct and that the images exist at those paths.
2. **CSS Adjustments**: Ensure the button container is properly sized and positioned.

### Implementation

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";

  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid) && emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                  disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
                />
              ))}
            </div>
          </>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-lg">
            Waiting for game action...
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Image URLs**: Ensure the images are correctly named and located in the `/creatures/` directory.
- **CSS Adjustments**: The `h-1/3` class for the user interface section should ensure it takes up enough space to display the buttons. Adjust the CSS if necessary to ensure visibility.

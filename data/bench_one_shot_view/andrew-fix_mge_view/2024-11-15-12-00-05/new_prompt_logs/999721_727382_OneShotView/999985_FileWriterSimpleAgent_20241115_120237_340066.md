Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the issue and provide a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and comparing it with the code, I notice that while the UI elements are visible, there seems to be an issue with the button interactions. The UI simulator is failing without capturing specific errors, which typically indicates that the expected interactions aren't being properly registered. This could be because:

1. The buttons are present but might not be properly hooked up to the event system
2. The `useCurrentButtons` hook might not be properly initialized or responding
3. The button click events might not be propagating correctly

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Add proper button accessibility attributes to ensure they're properly detectable
2. Add role="button" to improve interaction detection
3. Ensure buttons have proper focus states
4. Add aria-labels for better accessibility and testing detection
5. Add data-testid attributes to help with automated testing

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: bbe1636d-e8de-4afd-bd4a-e866cb67a216
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface GameStats {
  [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
  prototype_id: string;
  category: string;
}

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  stats: GameStats;
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  return (
    <Card className="w-full h-full relative overflow-hidden" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-800 to-slate-900">
        <div className="h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
          {/* Title Image Section */}
          <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center w-full">
            <div className="w-96 h-32 bg-slate-700 flex items-center justify-center rounded-lg">
              <span className="text-4xl font-bold text-white opacity-50">
                Game Title Image
              </span>
            </div>
          </div>

          {/* Button Container */}
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full max-w-md">
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
              <Button
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                className="w-full h-14 text-xl"
                variant="default"
                role="button"
                aria-label="Play Game"
                data-testid="play-button"
                tabIndex={0}
              >
                <Play className="w-6 h-6 mr-2" />
                Play Game
              </Button>
            )}

            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
              <Button
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                className="w-full h-14 text-xl"
                variant="destructive"
                role="button"
                aria-label="Quit Game"
                data-testid="quit-button"
                tabIndex={0}
              >
                <XCircle className="w-6 h-6 mr-2" />
                Quit
              </Button>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

These changes should improve the button interaction detection and accessibility, making it easier for both users and automated tests to interact with the buttons properly. The added attributes will help ensure that the UI simulator can properly detect and interact with the buttons, resolving the interaction issues that were causing the tests to fail silently.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

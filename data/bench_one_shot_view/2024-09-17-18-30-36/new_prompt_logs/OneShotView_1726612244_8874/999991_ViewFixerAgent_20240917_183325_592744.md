Can you please fix the following issue?

On the game screen, there are supposed to be choices allowing to the user to do the following:

[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: Remaining choices list was empty, it is possible we never received any choices or it could be another issue on the UI'}]

Error in main process: Error: [ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices: Remaining choices list was empty, it is possible we never received any choices or it could be another issue on the UI
at simulateGameplay (/Users/yueranyuan/volter/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:132:23)
at async main (/Users/yueranyuan/volter/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:208:9)



It does not appear that these choices are able to be made on the screen.



This could be because they simply aren't there, or because they have somehow not rendered (off screen, invisible,

covered, etc).  Often times they might be obscured by another element, or flowing off the screen.

Thanks!!!

Please write out the complete file in the format:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.

Content: Based on the provided image, it seems that the choices (skills) are being rendered correctly, but there might be an issue with the layout or the way the choices are being displayed. The choices might be getting obscured or not displayed properly due to CSS issues.

To address this, I will ensure that the choices are rendered properly and are visible on the screen. I will also add some CSS adjustments to make sure the choices are not obscured or flowing off the screen.

Here is the complete file with the proposed solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

  };

interface Player {

    foe_creature: Creature;

}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { currentButtonIds, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { availableInteractiveThingIds, emitThingClick } = useThingInteraction();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

  console.log("Player Creature Skills:", playerCreature.collections.skills);
  console.log("Available Interactive Thing IDs:", availableInteractiveThingIds);

  const renderCreature = (creature: Creature, isPlayer: boolean) => (
    <Card className={`p-4 ${isPlayer ? 'ml-auto' : 'mr-auto'} w-1/3`}>

      <div className="flex items-center mt-2">

        <span>{creature.stats.hp} / {creature.stats.max_hp}</span>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col">

        </div>

        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 mt-auto">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills.length > 0 ? (
            playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <Button
                key={skill.uid}
                onClick={() => emitThingClick(skill.uid)}

            ))
          ) : (
            <div className="col-span-2 text-center text-gray-500">
              No skills available
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>

      {currentButtonIds.includes('tackle') && (
        <Alert className="mt-4">
          <AlertTitle>Combat Action</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>
            Use Tackle to attack your opponent!
          </AlertDescription>
        </Alert>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **CSS Adjustments**: Ensured that the choices (skills) are rendered within a grid layout with `grid-cols-2` and `gap-4` to ensure proper spacing and alignment.
2. **Visibility**: Ensured that the choices are not obscured by other elements by placing them within a `div` with `mt-auto` to push them to the bottom of the container, ensuring they are visible.

This should address the issue of the choices not being visible or selectable on the screen. If the problem persists, further investigation into the CSS and layout might be necessary.

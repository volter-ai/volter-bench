Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: {
    creatures: Array<{
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
      description: string;
      stats: {
        hp: number;
        max_hp: number;
      };
      collections: {
        skills: Array<{
          uid: string;
          display_name: string;
          description: string;
          stats: {
            damage: number;
          };
        }>;
      };
    }>;
  };
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  __type: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const {
    enabledUIDs
  } = useThingInteraction()

  const renderButtons = () => {
    const buttons = [
      { id: 'play', label: 'Play', icon: <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
      { id: 'quit', label: 'Quit', icon: <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
    ];

    return buttons.map(button => (
      availableButtonSlugs.includes(button.id) && (
        <Button
          key={button.id}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(button.id)}
          className="w-48 flex items-center justify-center"
          uid={`button-${button.id}`}
          disabled={!enabledUIDs.includes(`button-${button.id}`)}
        >
          {button.icon}
          {button.label}
        </Button>
      )
    ));
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
        {data.display_name || "Game Title"}
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-auto mb-16 space-y-4">
        {renderButtons()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed: 
Error in main process: Error: Timeout after 120s
at Timeout._onTimeout (/Users/andrewvolter/Desktop/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:357:24)
at listOnTimeout (node:internal/timers:581:17)
at process.processTimers (node:internal/timers:519:7)

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows that the title and buttons are not positioned correctly according to the design document. The title should be at the top middle, and the buttons should be at the bottom middle. Currently, both are centered vertically, which is not as specified.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Title Positioning**: Move the title to the top middle of the screen.
2. **Button Positioning**: Move the buttons to the bottom middle of the screen.

### Code Changes

- Adjust the flexbox properties to position the title at the top and the buttons at the bottom.
- Use `justify-between` to ensure the title and buttons are at opposite ends of the container.

### Rewritten Code

```jsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: {
    creatures: Array<{
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
      description: string;
      stats: {
        hp: number;
        max_hp: number;
      };
      collections: {
        skills: Array<{
          uid: string;
          display_name: string;
          description: string;
          stats: {
            damage: number;
          };
        }>;
      };
    }>;
  };
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  __type: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const {
    enabledUIDs
  } = useThingInteraction();

  const renderButtons = () => {
    const buttons = [
      { id: 'play', label: 'Play', icon: <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
      { id: 'quit', label: 'Quit', icon: <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
    ];

    return buttons.map(button => (
      availableButtonSlugs.includes(button.id) && (
        <Button
          key={button.id}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(button.id)}
          className="w-48 flex items-center justify-center"
          uid={`button-${button.id}`}
          disabled={!enabledUIDs.includes(`button-${button.id}`)}
        >
          {button.icon}
          {button.label}
        </Button>
      )
    ));
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
        {data.display_name || "Game Title"}
      </h1>
      <div className="flex-grow"></div>
      <div className="mb-16 space-y-4">
        {renderButtons()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Flexbox Adjustments**: The `justify-between` property is used to place the title at the top and the buttons at the bottom.
- **Spacing**: Added a `flex-grow` div to push the buttons to the bottom, ensuring they are correctly positioned.

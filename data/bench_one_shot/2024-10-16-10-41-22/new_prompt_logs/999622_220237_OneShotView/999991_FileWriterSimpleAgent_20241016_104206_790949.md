## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Within this container, we'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title:
   The game title will be placed at the top-middle of the screen using Tailwind classes for positioning and styling.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a separate function to render the buttons, which will be placed at the bottom-middle of the screen. This function will use the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from the useCurrentButtons hook to determine which buttons to display and handle click events.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient using Tailwind classes to create a visually appealing main menu background.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing or undefined.

8. Icons:
   We'll use Lucide React icons for the buttons to enhance the visual appeal of the menu.

Using Tailwind for the described view:
- We'll use `flex`, `flex-col`, and `items-center` classes to create a centered, vertical layout.
- `w-full` and `h-full` classes will make the component take up the full width and height of its container.
- We'll use `text-center` and text size classes like `text-4xl` for the title.
- For the buttons, we'll use `mt-auto` to push them to the bottom of the container, and `space-y-4` to add vertical spacing between buttons.
- Background styling will be achieved using classes like `bg-gradient-to-b` and color utilities.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 794b6a22-bcfb-4a6e-88c1-9f2fbba2d44c
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const {
    enabledUIDs
  } = useThingInteraction()

  const renderButtons = () => {
    const buttons = [
      { id: 'play', label: 'Play', icon: <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
      { id: 'quit', label: 'Quit', icon: <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> },
    ];

    return buttons.map(button => (
      availableButtonSlugs.includes(button.id) && (
        <Button
          key={button.id}
          onClick={() => emitButtonClick(button.id)}
          className="w-48 flex items-center justify-center"
        >
          {button.icon}
          {button.label}
        </Button>
      )
    ));
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
        {props.data?.display_name || "Game Title"}
      </h1>
      <div className="mt-auto mb-16 space-y-4">
        {renderButtons()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a centered title at the top, and buttons at the bottom. The buttons are conditionally rendered based on the availableButtonSlugs, and the component handles potential missing data gracefully. The layout is responsive and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio when contained in an appropriate parent element.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

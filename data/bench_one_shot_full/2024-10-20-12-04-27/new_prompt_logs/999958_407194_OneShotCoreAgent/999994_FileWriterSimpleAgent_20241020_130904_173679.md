## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Handle equal speed with randomness:
   - In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
   - If speeds are equal, we'll use `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first.

2. Reset the state of player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene:
   - We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max HP.
   - We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now handles the case where creatures have equal speed by randomly choosing which creature goes first.
2. The `reset_creatures` method is added and called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their max HP.

These modifications should resolve the identified issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.


Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: **Issue Description:**

1. **Missing Player Indicators:** The image does not show any indicators specifying which creature belongs to the player and which to the opponent. This is a requirement in the design document.

2. **UI Elements:** The "Waiting for your turn..." message is displayed, indicating that no buttons are available for interaction. This might be due to the `availableButtonSlugs` not being properly utilized.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. **Add Player Indicators:** Add labels or icons to indicate which creature is the player's and which is the opponent's.

2. **Ensure Button Functionality:** Ensure that the `emitButtonClick` function is called with the correct `availableButtonSlugs` instead of the skill UID.

**Code Changes:**

- Add labels or icons to indicate player and opponent creatures.
- Modify the button click handler to use `availableButtonSlugs`.

```jsx

        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Player Indicators:** Added text labels "Player" and "Opponent" above each creature to clearly indicate ownership.
- **Button Functionality:** Modified the button rendering logic to use `availableButtonSlugs` for button clicks, ensuring the correct slugs are emitted.

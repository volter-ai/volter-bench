## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement a random tie-breaker when both creatures have the same speed.
2. Explicitly handle the 'Normal' type effectiveness in the type effectiveness chart.

These changes will be made within the existing architecture and capabilities of the engine. Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def check_battle_end(self):

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `resolve_turn` method now includes a random tie-breaker when both creatures have the same speed. This ensures that the turn order is fairly determined in such cases.

2. The `get_type_effectiveness` method now explicitly includes the 'Normal' type in the effectiveness chart. It has neutral effectiveness (1) against all types, including itself.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA pass while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

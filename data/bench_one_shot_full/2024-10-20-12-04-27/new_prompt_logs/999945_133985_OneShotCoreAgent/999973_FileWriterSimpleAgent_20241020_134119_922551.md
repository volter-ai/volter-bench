## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and use this to break out of the main game loop.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP at the end of the battle.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the engine's architecture. We don't need to modify any models, as the issue is with the game logic in the scene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 5d4c12b8-9c89-41a3-8993-bd9a7a2c279d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to restore all creatures' HP at the end of the battle.
2. Modifying the `run` method to break out of the main game loop when `check_battle_end` returns `True`.
3. Adding a `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` call at the end of the `run` method to ensure the scene exits properly.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the `MainGameScene` exits correctly, either by transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game when appropriate. The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine without modifying any models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! Here's the corrected code for the MainMenuScene component:

# Excerpt ID: 0077a4c5-25e9-4fc2-9052-78f11c8f8aad
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: {
            uid: string,
            stats: {
                [key: string]: number,
            },
            [key: string]: any,
        }
        [key: string]: any,
    }
    [key: string]: any,
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex space-x-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 bg-green-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-green-600 transition-colors"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
                        Play
                    </button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 bg-red-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-red-600 transition-colors"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
                        Quit
                    </button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-purple-900 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                {props.data.display_name || 'Awesome Game'}
            </h1>
            <div className="flex-grow" />
            {renderButtons()}
        </div>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned earlier:

1. We've kept the original GameUIData interface as provided in the boilerplate, allowing for flexibility in the data structure.

2. We've removed any custom interfaces that were not part of the original boilerplate.

3. The component still maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio and full-screen layout as requested.

4. We're using Tailwind CSS for styling and maintaining the requested layout with the title at the top and buttons at the bottom.

5. We're still checking for available buttons using the availableButtonSlugs array.

6. Error handling is implemented by providing a default game title if the display_name is not available in the props.

7. We're using icons from lucide-react as allowed.

This version should now be compliant with all the guidelines provided. Note that we didn't need to pass a uid prop in this component as we're not using any custom UI components that require it. If in the future we add any custom UI components that require a uid, we should remember to pass it accordingly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After a battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a loop in the run method to allow for multiple battles.
3. We'll use the _transition_to_scene method to exit the scene properly.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: dd265ceb-1f13-4d6d-85f1-b8aeeee4e83e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")
            battle_result = self.game_loop()
            
            if battle_result == "player_win":
                self._show_text(self.player, "Congratulations! You won the battle!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle. Better luck next time!")
            
            play_again = Button("Play Again")
            main_menu = Button("Main Menu")
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, main_menu])
            
            if choice == main_menu:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            else:
                # Reset creatures for a new battle
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            battle_result = self.check_battle_end()
            if battle_result:
                return battle_result

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted!")
            return "player_lose"
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted!")
            return "player_win"
        return None
```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a loop in the `run` method to allow for multiple battles.
2. Providing an option to play again or return to the main menu after each battle.
3. Using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to properly exit the scene and return to the main menu.
4. Resetting creature HP for new battles if the player chooses to play again.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or allowing the player to quit the game via the main menu.

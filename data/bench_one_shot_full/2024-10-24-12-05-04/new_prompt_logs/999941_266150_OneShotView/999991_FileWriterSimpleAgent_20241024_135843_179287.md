## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the issues and follows all the guidelines more closely. Here's the updated implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 8066d728-5ab8-4455-ae09-01040527c5cc
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  uid: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <div className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center">
          Creature Battle Game
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
        {Object.entries(buttonConfig).map(([slug, { text, icon: Icon }]) => (
          availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug) && (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="bg-white text-purple-600 font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded-full flex items-center space-x-2 hover:bg-purple-100 transition-colors"
            >
              <Icon size={24} />
              <span>{text}</span>
            </Button>
          )
        ))}
      </div>

      <div className="mt-4 text-white text-center">
        <p>Welcome, {data.entities.player?.display_name ?? "Player"}!</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the following points:

1. We've imported the `Button` component from "@/components/ui/button", which is likely a shadcn component.
2. We've used the `Button` component instead of a native `button` element, which better aligns with using existing UI components.
3. We've added a `uid` field to the `GameUIData` interface, as it seems this should be present based on the example data provided.
4. We've used destructuring in the component props for cleaner code.
5. We've used the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) instead of the logical OR (`||`) for the fallback player name, which is a more precise way to handle null or undefined values.

This implementation now better follows all the guidelines provided, including using shadcn components where appropriate. The `uid` is not explicitly passed to any components here, but it's available in the `data` object if needed for future use.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

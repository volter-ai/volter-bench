## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The random run test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to call this transition method after the battle loop ends.
3. We'll ensure that the `_check_battle_end` method returns True when the battle is over, allowing the main loop to exit.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3e68010f-c3e9-4a17-9c74-7ecbac1f1a95
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "Battle start!")

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._return_to_main_menu()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.foe_creature, player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill.damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, damage: int):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp

    def _return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `_return_to_main_menu` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
2. Calling `self._return_to_main_menu()` at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.
3. Keeping the `_check_battle_end` method as is, which correctly returns True when the battle is over.

These changes should resolve both the issue of the MainGameScene not exiting properly and the failing random run test. The scene will now always transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends, ensuring that it exits in an expected manner.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

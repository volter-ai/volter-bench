## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to reset the player's creatures' state after the battle ends in the MainGameScene. This is a requirement specified in the architecture documentation that we overlooked in the previous implementation.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `run` method.

This approach aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as we're only manipulating the existing attributes of the Creature objects.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: c33f87e8-f5ca-4dad-8da3-31bbb6ad8fb8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
> Use Skill
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures' state
        self.reset_creatures()

        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button])
        
        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            return skill_choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding the `reset_creatures` method and calling it before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that all creatures' HP is reset to their maximum values after each battle, as required by the architecture documentation.

The changes are confined to the MainGameScene class and do not affect the models, maintaining the separation of concerns and adhering to the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

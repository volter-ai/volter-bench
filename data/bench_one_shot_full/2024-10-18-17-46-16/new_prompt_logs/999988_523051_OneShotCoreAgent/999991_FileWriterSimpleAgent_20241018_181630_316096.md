## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Call the reset_creatures method after the battle ends and before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.
2. Implement a skill queue for both players to explicitly handle skill execution as described in the documentation.
3. Modify the resolution phase to execute skills from the queue and clear the queue after execution.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 0902670d-f292-4421-a992-d0434ddc5a20
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue: List[Skill] = []
        self.opponent_skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.opponent_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.opponent_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.player_skill_queue or self.opponent_skill_queue:
            if self.player_skill_queue:
                player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
                self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage

            if self.opponent_skill_queue:
                opponent_skill = self.opponent_skill_queue.pop(0)
                self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self.player_skill_queue.clear()
        self.opponent_skill_queue.clear()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Calling the reset_creatures method after the battle ends and before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.
2. Implementing skill queues (player_skill_queue and opponent_skill_queue) to explicitly handle skill execution.
3. Modifying the resolution_phase to execute skills from the queues and clear them after execution.
4. Ensuring that the battle loop breaks if the battle ends during the resolution phase.

These modifications should resolve the QA issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is called with no choices. This is happening in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class when all creatures of a player are either knocked out or already active. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Modify the `choose_swap` method to handle the case when there are no available creatures to swap.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. Update the `player_choice_phase` method to handle the case when `choose_swap` returns `None`.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_counter = 0

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by checking if there are any available creatures to swap before calling `_wait_for_choice`. If there are no available creatures, the `choose_swap` method returns `None`, and the `player_choice_phase` method handles this case by showing a message to the player and continuing the loop to allow them to choose another action.

This change should prevent the `AssertionError` that was occurring when `_wait_for_choice` was called with an empty list of choices.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

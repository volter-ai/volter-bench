# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const [showText, setShowText] = useState(true);

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid ?? ""}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Sword className="mr-1" /> Player
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature?.uid ?? ""}
            name={opponentCreature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder.jpg"
            hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Shield className="mr-1" /> Opponent
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-white p-4 overflow-y-auto">
        {showText ? (
          <div className="text-lg">
            Battle in progress... Choose your next move!
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Text and Button Toggle**: The UI is stuck displaying the text "Battle in progress... Choose your next move!" and does not switch to show the skill buttons. This suggests that the `showText` state is not being toggled correctly.

2. **Skill Button Emission**: The `emitButtonClick` function should only emit available button slugs, not skill UIDs.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Toggle Functionality**: Implement a mechanism to toggle between showing the text and the skill buttons. This could be a button or an event that changes the `showText` state.

2. **Emit Correct Slugs**: Ensure that `emitButtonClick` is called with the correct available button slugs, not the skill UIDs.

### Code Changes

1. Add a button to toggle the `showText` state.
2. Modify the `emitButtonClick` call to use `availableButtonSlugs`.

### Implementation

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const [showText, setShowText] = useState(true);

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid ?? ""}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Sword className="mr-1" /> Player
          </div>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature?.uid ?? ""}
            name={opponentCreature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder.jpg"
            hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Shield className="mr-1" /> Opponent
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-white p-4 overflow-y-auto">
        {showText ? (
          <div className="text-lg">
            Battle in progress... Choose your next move!
            <button onClick={() => setShowText(false)} className="ml-4 p-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded">
              Show Skills
            </button>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={slug}
                uid={slug}
                skillName={slug}
                description="Skill description"
                stats="Skill stats"
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Toggle Button**: Added a button to toggle the `showText` state, allowing the user to switch between the text and skill buttons.
- **Correct Emission**: Changed the `emitButtonClick` to use `availableButtonSlugs` instead of skill UIDs, ensuring the correct slugs are emitted.

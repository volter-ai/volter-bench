## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase for both Attack and Swap choices.
2. Implement correct action execution order based on speed.
3. Add random turn order for creatures with the same speed.
4. Reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the pure data schema nature of the models.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. Added a 'Back' option in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main action selection.
2. Implemented correct action execution order based on speed in the `execute_turn` method.
3. Added random turn order for creatures with the same speed using `random.random()` as a secondary sorting key.
4. Added a `reset_creatures_state` method to reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the scene, called in the `end_battle` method.

These changes maintain the structure of the `MainGameScene` class while addressing the QA issues and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. You're right that I overlooked the requirement to perform damage calculations with floats before converting to integers. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement the damage calculation with floats as specified in the architecture, we'll modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll do it:

a. We'll change the damage calculation in the execute_turn method to use floats.
b. We'll only convert the final damage to an integer after all calculations are done.
c. We'll use the round() function to ensure proper rounding of the float to the nearest integer.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

2. Rewritten file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 051a5356-6596-47fb-9992-3599df39fc53
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated implementation are:

1. In the `execute_turn` method, we now use `float()` to ensure that `raw_damage` is calculated as a float.
2. The `get_type_factor` method now returns float values (e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 0.5) instead of integers.
3. We use the `round()` function to convert the final damage calculation to the nearest integer, as per the architecture requirements.

These changes ensure that the damage calculation is performed with floats and then converted to an integer, aligning with the specified requirements in the architecture documentation. The rest of the implementation remains unchanged, maintaining the existing model structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both the missing 'Back' option in the player choice phase and the lack of randomness handling for speed ties. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Adding 'Back' option:
   - In the `player_turn` method, we'll add a 'Back' button to the attack and swap choices.
   - We'll implement a loop that allows the player to go back to the main choice if they select 'Back'.

2. Handling speed ties:
   - We'll modify the `resolve_turn` method to use a random tiebreaker when creatures have the same speed.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 1e0b871e-5ad1-493e-855b-1623888d0b2c

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choices. If the player selects 'Back', the method returns `None`, which causes the `player_turn` method to loop back to the main choice.

2. Speed ties are now resolved randomly. In the `resolve_turn` method, we've modified the sorting key to include a random number as a tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

These modifications should bring the implementation in line with the specified requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the `_determine_order` method of the `MainGameScene` class. It's trying to use `player_skill` and `opponent_skill`, which are not defined in that method. We need to pass these skills as parameters to the `_determine_order` method.

Here's how I'll fix this issue:

1. Modify the `_resolution_phase` method to pass the skills to the `_determine_order` method.
2. Update the `_determine_order` method to accept the skills as parameters.
3. Adjust the return statement in `_determine_order` to include the correct skills.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 106af5e6-4d3a-4785-b4f7-95087da6f9c7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, opponent):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
        
        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[1], first[2])
        if self._check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[1], second[2])

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution should resolve the NameError issues by properly passing the skills to the `_determine_order` method and using them in the return statement. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning or quitting correctly after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the battle loop continues until one of the creatures faints, and then properly exit the scene.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: e90d9a40-ee55-4836-9ae8-0d72ef66cc22
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.battle_round():
                break
        
        # After the battle ends, ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
        return self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        if self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):
            return True
        if self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill):
            return True
        return False

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self.get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = max(1, int(factor * raw_damage))  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

        if defender.hp == 0:
            winner = self.player if defender == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} fainted! {winner.display_name} wins!")
            return True
        return False

    def get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle continues until one creature faints.
2. After the battle ends, the player is given a choice to play again or quit.
3. Based on the player's choice, the scene either transitions back to the MainMenuScene or quits the whole game.

This solution should resolve both issues:
1. The MainGameScene now properly exits by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The whole game flow should now work correctly, as the MainGameScene will always end with a transition or quit action.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

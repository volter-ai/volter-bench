## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement an explicit skill queue management system.
2. Add a method to reset the player's creatures' states after the battle ends.

These changes will be made while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines. Here's the updated `MainGameScene`:

# Excerpt ID: c9292ff8-a67e-48e7-a0d6-77d25d86094d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List, Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Player, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}

Skill Queue:
{self._format_skill_queue()}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def _format_skill_queue(self):
        return "\n".join([f"{player.display_name}: {skill.display_name}" for player, skill in self.skill_queue])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._player_turn()
            self._foe_turn()
            self._resolve_turn()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn! Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, choice.thing))

    def _foe_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.foe, "Foe's turn! Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.foe, choice.thing))

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if attacker == self.player:
                target = self.foe_creature
            else:
                target = self.player_creature
            self._apply_damage(attacker, target, skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, target, skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. Explicit skill queue management: The `skill_queue` is now an explicit list of tuples containing the player and the chosen skill. Skills are added to the queue during the player and foe turns, and then resolved in order during the resolution phase.

2. Resetting creatures' states: The `_reset_creatures` method has been added to restore all creatures to full health after the battle ends. This method is called before transitioning back to the main menu scene.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns more closely with the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file remains unchanged, as it already adheres to the guidelines of being pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

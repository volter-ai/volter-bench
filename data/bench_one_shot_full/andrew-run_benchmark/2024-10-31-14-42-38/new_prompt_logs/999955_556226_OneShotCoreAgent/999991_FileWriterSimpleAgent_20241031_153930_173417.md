## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that aligns with the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issue of not randomizing the order of skill execution when creatures have equal speed, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speeds and use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first in that case.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4d41fd7f-fb1a-4f20-ae04-e255894a9dfb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures' HP before transitioning
        self.reset_creatures()
        
        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            creatures = [(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, 2)

        self.execute_skill(*first[:2], first[2], second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(*second[:2], second[2], first[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolve_turn` method to handle the case where creatures have equal speed. When speeds are equal, it uses `random.sample` to randomly determine the order of skill execution. This change ensures that the implementation aligns with the architecture documentation's requirement for randomizing the order when speeds are equal.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models or other parts of the game architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

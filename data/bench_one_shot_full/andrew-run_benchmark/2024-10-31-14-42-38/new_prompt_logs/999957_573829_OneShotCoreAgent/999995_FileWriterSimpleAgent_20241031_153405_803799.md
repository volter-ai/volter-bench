## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to break out of the main loop when the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the `_check_battle_end` method returns True when the battle is over.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 255a0572-ed2c-4433-ba85-bb06c78abeb7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = self._calculate_raw_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        type_factor = self._calculate_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_raw_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            return attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            return (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def _calculate_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. The main modifications are:

1. In the `run` method, we now break out of the main loop when `_check_battle_end()` returns True.
2. After the main loop, we call `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to return to the main menu.
3. The `_check_battle_end` method now correctly returns True when either creature's HP reaches 0.

These changes should fix both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the lack of transition after the battle ends. The tests should now pass as the scene will properly exit and transition, meeting the expectations set in the test cases.

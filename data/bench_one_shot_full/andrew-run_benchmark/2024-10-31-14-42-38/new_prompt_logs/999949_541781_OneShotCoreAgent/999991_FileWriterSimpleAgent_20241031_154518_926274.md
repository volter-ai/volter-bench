## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue:

1. To fix the issue of missing random order for skill execution when creatures have equal speed, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal, and if so, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to determine which creature goes first.

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement this change. The rest of the file will remain the same, ensuring we stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 840c6e47-8331-4eec-ab93-2d8a71c96787
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolve_turn` method to include a random choice when the creatures have equal speed. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining compatibility with the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

The changes made are:

1. We've added an `elif` condition to check if the speeds are exactly equal.
2. If speeds are equal, we use `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
3. We then execute the skills in the randomly chosen order.

These changes ensure that when creatures have equal speed, the order of skill execution is randomized, adding the required element of fairness to the gameplay mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

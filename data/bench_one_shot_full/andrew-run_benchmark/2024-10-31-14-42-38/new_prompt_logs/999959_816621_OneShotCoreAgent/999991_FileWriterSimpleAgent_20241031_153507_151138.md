## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement random order for skill execution when creatures have the same speed. This aligns with the gameplay mechanics described in the architecture documentation. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class to handle the case when creatures have the same speed.
2. We'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
3. We'll keep the existing logic for when one creature is faster than the other.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models. It only affects the gameplay logic in the `MainGameScene`.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e6d7c8ce-115a-4d36-9256-b29e44d868a2

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def check_battle_end(self):

This implementation now correctly handles the case when creatures have the same speed by randomly choosing which creature goes first. This aligns with the gameplay mechanics described in the architecture documentation and should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

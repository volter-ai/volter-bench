## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the Main Game Scene, we need to make changes to the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method in two places:
   a. At the beginning of the `run()` method to ensure creatures start with full HP.
   b. At the end of the `check_battle_end()` method, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b6602081-59e5-4fd0-a2bf-50084c6c81a4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self.reset_creatures_state()  # Reset creatures' state at the start of the battle
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def foe_turn(self):

        return self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices).thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()  # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()  # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by resetting the creatures' state (HP) at the beginning of each battle and before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that the creatures' HP is always at its maximum when starting a new battle, maintaining the game's integrity and following the architecture requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that the current implementation doesn't handle equal speeds during the resolution phase as described in the documentation. To fix this, we need to modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll modify the sorting key for the turn queue to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
2. We'll use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random number between 0 and 1 for each action in the queue.
3. The sorting key will now be a tuple of (is_not_swap, -speed, random_number), which will ensure that:
   a. Swap actions always go first
   b. Higher speed actions go before lower speed actions
   c. When speeds are equal, the order is randomized

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random factor in the sorting key. Now, when two actions have the same speed, their order will be randomized, as specified in the documentation. This change ensures that the implementation correctly handles equal speeds during the resolution phase, while maintaining the overall structure and logic of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

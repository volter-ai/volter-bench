## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing until a proper exit condition is met.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to ensure that it always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll adjust the game loop in the MainGameScene to continue until the battle is over, and then transition to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits as expected and the tests pass. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `_check_battle_end` method to set the `battle_ended` flag when the battle is over.
3. Ensuring that the `run` method continues the game loop until `battle_ended` is True.
4. Always calling `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the battle in the `_end_battle` method.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

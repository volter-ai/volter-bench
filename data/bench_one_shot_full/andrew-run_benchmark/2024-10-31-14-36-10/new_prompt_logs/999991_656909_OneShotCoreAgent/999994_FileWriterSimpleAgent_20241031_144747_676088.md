## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state after a battle ends, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` in the `MainGameScene` class.
2. This method will reset the HP of both the player's and the foe's creatures to their maximum HP.
3. We'll call this method at the end of the battle, just before transitioning back to the main menu.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ea3e37b1-bec1-4109-a05f-5a2c08dc9d82
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn, {self.player.display_name}!")
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe turn
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"It's your turn, {self.foe.display_name}!")
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures_state()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(current_player, skill_choices).thing

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.foe_creature, player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def _apply_damage(self, creature, damage):
        creature.hp = max(0, creature.hp - damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "Creatures' health has been restored.")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "Creatures' health has been restored.")
```

This solution adds the `_reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of both creatures to their maximum values. The method is called after the battle ends and before transitioning back to the main menu. This ensures that the creatures' state is reset after each battle, as required by the architecture documents.

The changes made are:

1. Added the `_reset_creatures_state()` method.
2. Modified the `run()` method to call `_reset_creatures_state()` and transition to the main menu when the battle ends.

These changes address the issue while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

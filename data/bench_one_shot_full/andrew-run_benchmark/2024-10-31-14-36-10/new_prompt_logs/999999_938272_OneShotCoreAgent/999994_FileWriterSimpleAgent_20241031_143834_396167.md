## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, I will modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. Add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` in the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot to their max_hp.
3. Call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, whether the player wins or loses.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, as we're only manipulating the existing attributes of the Creature objects.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f23cb310-b3a3-4324-b2da-108b1ba210fd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Opponent's turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.bot_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Player's skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}! It dealt {player_skill.damage} damage.")
        
        # Bot's skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {bot_skill.display_name}! It dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage.")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by resetting the state of all creatures (both for the player and the bot) before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. The `_reset_creatures_state()` method is called in the `_check_battle_end()` method, ensuring that the creatures' HP is reset to their maximum value before leaving the battle scene, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

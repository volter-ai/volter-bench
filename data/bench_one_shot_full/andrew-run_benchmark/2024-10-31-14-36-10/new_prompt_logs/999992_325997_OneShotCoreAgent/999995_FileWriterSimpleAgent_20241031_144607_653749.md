## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue of popping from an empty list in the `_resolve_turn` method, we need to ensure that the skill queues are never empty when we try to resolve a turn. The problem occurs because we're not checking if the players have actually chosen a skill before trying to resolve the turn. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to ensure that both players have chosen a skill before resolving the turn.
2. We'll add a check in the `run` method to only call `_resolve_turn` when both skill queues are non-empty.
3. We'll modify the `_player_turn` and `_opponent_turn` methods to ensure they always add a skill to their respective queues.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 00ef970a-9a07-43ea-a245-38d5a9d79cdd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.opponent_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._player_turn()
            self._opponent_turn()

            # Only resolve the turn if both players have chosen a skill
            if self.player_skill_queue and self.opponent_skill_queue:
                self._resolve_turn()

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self.player_skill_queue.append(skill_choice.thing)
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        # Ensure a skill is always chosen
        if not self.player_skill_queue:
            self.player_skill_queue.append(self.player_creature.skills[0])

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        self.opponent_skill_queue.append(skill_choice.thing)

        # Ensure a skill is always chosen
        if not self.opponent_skill_queue:
            self.opponent_skill_queue.append(self.opponent_creature.skills[0])

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        opponent_skill = self.opponent_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The `run` method only calls `_resolve_turn` when both skill queues are non-empty.
2. The `_player_turn` and `_opponent_turn` methods always add a skill to their respective queues, even if the player or bot doesn't make a choice (in which case, the first skill is chosen by default).

These modifications should prevent the IndexError from occurring while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

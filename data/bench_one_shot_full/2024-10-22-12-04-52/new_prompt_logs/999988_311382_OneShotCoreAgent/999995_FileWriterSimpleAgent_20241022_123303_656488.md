## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The `MainGameScene` is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is an antipattern.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the `MainMenuScene`. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended.
2. If the battle has ended, we'll show the result and then transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit is called.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 350cdc6f-0fbe-4aae-a930-5a0bd3f27cdc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
                self._show_battle_result()
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, skill: Skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Ensuring that the game loop continues until the battle has ended.
3. When the battle ends, we show the result, reset the creatures, and transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
4. Using `_transition_to_scene` to properly exit the scene and return to the main menu.

This implementation should resolve both the test failure in `test_main_game_scene.py` and the antipattern issue raised in `test_whole_game.py`. The scene now properly exits by transitioning to another scene, which should satisfy the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the run method to properly handle the end of the battle and transition to the next scene.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 6149dd10-6007-4bf3-b936-c852bb6ba3d1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},

    def check_battle_end(self):

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a "Return to Main Menu" option in the player's choices.
2. Implementing a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the game loop.
3. Ensuring that the scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends or when the player chooses to return to the main menu.
4. Handling the "return_to_menu" choice in the resolution phase to avoid errors.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when appropriate.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

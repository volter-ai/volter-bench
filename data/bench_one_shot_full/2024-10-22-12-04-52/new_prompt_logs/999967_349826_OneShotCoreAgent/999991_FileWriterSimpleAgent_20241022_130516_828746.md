## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for overlooking the speed-based turn order in the previous implementation. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated MainGameScene file.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement speed-based turn order, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

a. Instead of having separate player and opponent turns, we'll create a single turn system that determines the order based on the creatures' speed.

b. We'll create a method called `_determine_turn_order` that compares the speed of both creatures and returns a list of creatures in the order they should act.

c. In the main game loop, we'll use this turn order to execute actions for each creature.

d. If the speeds are equal, we'll use random selection to determine which creature goes first, as specified in the architecture.

e. We'll update the `__str__` method to display the speed of both creatures for better visibility of the game state.

These changes will ensure that the implementation follows the speed-based turn order as described in the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Updated MainGameScene file:

This updated implementation now correctly implements the speed-based turn order as described in the architecture. The main changes are in the `run` method, which now uses `_execute_turn` to determine the order of actions based on the creatures' speed. The `_determine_turn_order` method handles the logic for deciding which creature acts first, including the random selection when speeds are equal. The `__str__` method has also been updated to display the speed of both creatures for better visibility of the game state.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

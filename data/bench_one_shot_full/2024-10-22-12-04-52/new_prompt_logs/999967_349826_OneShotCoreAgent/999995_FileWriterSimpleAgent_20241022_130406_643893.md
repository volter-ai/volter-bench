## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends, leading to a FixableException.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a new method `_end_battle` to handle the end of the battle.
2. In the `_check_battle_end` method, we'll call `_end_battle` when the battle is over.
3. The `_end_battle` method will show the result message and then either transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a11dce19-0cd2-431f-9e98-654fcb40d3d7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
            self._player_turn()
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
            self._opponent_turn()

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type)") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s turn!")
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")

        choices = [
            Button("Return to Main Menu"),
            Button("Quit Game")
        ]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses both issues by ensuring that the battle scene properly ends and transitions to either the main menu or quits the game. The `_end_battle` method is called when the battle ends, and it provides the player with a choice to return to the main menu or quit the game. This approach follows the engine's architecture and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing implementation for random order when creatures have equal speed during the resolution phase, I will modify the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. In the `resolve_turn` method of the `MainGameScene` class, we'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3c0eee17-0750-4a52-b2d7-aed72bc1747c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            # If speeds are equal, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        weakness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return weakness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding a condition in the `resolve_turn` method to handle the case when creatures have equal speed. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice` to randomly decide which creature goes first, ensuring that the order is determined randomly as specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

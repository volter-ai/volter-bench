## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout doesn't match the design document description. The battlefield display should occupy the upper 2/3 of the screen, but it appears to be taking up more space.

2. The user interface area at the bottom is too small and doesn't follow the 2x2 grid layout described in the design document.

3. The creature skills are not being displayed, which could be preventing the user from interacting with all available options.

4. The "Attack" and "Swap" buttons are not properly styled and don't include the icons mentioned in the code.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Adjust the layout to ensure the battlefield takes up 2/3 of the screen and the user interface takes up 1/3.
2. Implement the 2x2 grid layout for the user interface area.
3. Ensure that creature skills are being displayed properly.
4. Style the "Attack" and "Swap" buttons correctly and include their icons.

Here's the implemented solution:

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="attack-button"
              skillName="Attack"
              description="Perform a basic attack"

          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="swap-button"
              skillName="Swap"
              description="Swap your active creature"
              stats="Cost: 1 turn"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}
            >
              <RefreshCw className="mr-2" />
              Swap
            </SkillButton>
          )}
          {playerCreature?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton

              skillName={skill.display_name}

              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Adjusted the battlefield height to `h-2/3` and the user interface height to `h-1/3` to match the design document.
2. Implemented a 2x2 grid layout for the user interface area by changing `grid-cols-2` to `grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2` and adding `h-full` to ensure it takes up the full height of its container.
3. Kept the existing code for displaying creature skills, which should now be visible in the 2x2 grid.
4. The "Attack" and "Swap" buttons already included their respective icons, so no changes were needed there.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all interactive elements are visible and accessible, potentially fixing the timeout error by allowing the UI simulator to interact with all available choices.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

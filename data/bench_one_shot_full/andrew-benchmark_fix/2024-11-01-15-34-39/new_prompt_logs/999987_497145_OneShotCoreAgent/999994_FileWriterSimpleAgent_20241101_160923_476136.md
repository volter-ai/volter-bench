## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes:

1. Add an explicit skill queue to the MainGameScene.
2. Implement the resetting of creature states after a battle.

These changes will be made in the MainGameScene file. Here's how I'll implement these fixes:

1. Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the MainGameScene class to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. Modify the turn resolution to use the skill queue instead of immediately applying skills.
3. Add a method to reset creature states after the battle ends.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ce0a0c97-f2f6-42b6-bed1-ef1233ee5a6a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.damage} damage" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

            if quit_button == choice:
                self._quit_whole_game()

            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices).thing
            self.skill_queue.append(player_skill)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing
            self.skill_queue.append(opponent_skill)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creature_states()
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        for skill in self.skill_queue:
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.opponent_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self.skill_queue.clear()

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creature_states(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. We've added an explicit `skill_queue` to store the skills chosen by both players during the choice phases.
2. We've implemented a `_reset_creature_states` method that restores all creatures to full health after the battle ends.

The `_resolve_turn` method now uses the `skill_queue` to apply skills in the order they were chosen, and the queue is cleared after each turn. The `_reset_creature_states` method is called when the battle ends, ensuring that creatures are restored to their initial state for future battles.

These changes maintain the structure of the models as pure data schemas and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the identified issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

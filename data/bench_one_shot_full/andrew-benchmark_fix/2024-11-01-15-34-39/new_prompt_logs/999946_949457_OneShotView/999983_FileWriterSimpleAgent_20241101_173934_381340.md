## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the creatures and their status cards is incorrect. The opponent's creature (Scizard) and its status card are on opposite sides, and the same is true for the player's creature (Bubwool).

2. The creature images are much larger than intended, taking up a significant portion of the screen.

3. The user interface area at the bottom is only showing a waiting message, which suggests that the buttons are not being rendered or are not visible.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Adjust the grid layout to correctly position the creatures and their status cards.
2. Reduce the size of the creature images to fit better within the layout.
3. Ensure that the skill buttons are rendered when available.

Here's the implementation of these solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 518734b1-a786-459b-997a-fc34507feffa
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { MessageSquare } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  meta: {
    creature_type: string;
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4" style={{ height: '66.67%' }}>
        {/* Opponent Creature Status */}
        <div className="col-start-1 row-start-1 flex items-start justify-start">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature?.uid ?? ''}
            name={opponentCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            image={`/images/creatures/${opponentCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_front.png`}
            hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
            maxHp={opponentCreature?.stats.max_hp ?? 1}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="col-start-1 row-start-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <img
            src={`/images/creatures/${opponentCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_front.png`}
            alt={opponentCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            className="w-32 h-32 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="col-start-2 row-start-2 flex items-center justify-center">
          <img
            src={`/images/creatures/${playerCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_back.png`}
            alt={playerCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            className="w-32 h-32 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature Status */}
        <div className="col-start-2 row-start-2 flex items-end justify-end">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid ?? ''}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            image={`/images/creatures/${playerCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_back.png`}
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
            maxHp={playerCreature?.stats.max_hp ?? 1}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4" style={{ height: '33.33%' }}>
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 h-full">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={slug}
                uid={slug}
                skillName={`Skill ${slug}`}
                description={`Description for skill ${slug}`}
                stats={`Damage: Unknown`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
            <MessageSquare className="w-8 h-8 mr-2" />
            <span>Waiting for game message...</span>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Adjusted the grid layout for the battlefield display. Now the opponent's creature and its status card are both in the first column, and the player's creature and its status card are both in the second column.

2. Reduced the size of the creature images from `w-48 h-48` to `w-32 h-32` to fit better within the layout.

3. Centered the creature images within their grid cells using `flex items-center justify-center`.

4. Kept the logic for rendering skill buttons or the waiting message unchanged, as it appears to be correct. The issue might be related to the `availableButtonSlugs` being empty, which is handled by the game logic outside of this component.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all elements are visible and correctly positioned. If the timeout error persists, it may be related to the game logic not providing `availableButtonSlugs` in time, which would need to be investigated in the game state management code.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues with the current implementation:

1. The battlefield display is not correctly laid out. The opponent's creature (Scizard) and the player's creature (Bubwool) are not positioned as described in the design document.

2. The creature status cards are not positioned correctly. They should be in the opposite corners from their respective creatures.

3. The user interface area at the bottom is not showing any skill buttons, only a "Waiting for game message..." text.

4. The overall layout doesn't seem to respect the 2/3 to 1/3 ratio between the battlefield and the user interface areas.

Proposed solution:

1. Adjust the grid layout of the battlefield display to correctly position the creatures and their status cards.
2. Ensure that the battlefield display takes up 2/3 of the screen height, and the user interface takes up 1/3.
3. Implement proper rendering of skill buttons when they are available.
4. Adjust the sizing and positioning of creature images and status cards.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b59c5e89-43ad-45cd-8040-612d6ac2bda1
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { MessageSquare } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  meta: {
    creature_type: string;
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4" style={{ height: '66.67%' }}>
        {/* Opponent Creature Status */}
        <div className="col-start-1 row-start-1 flex items-start justify-start">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature?.uid ?? ''}
            name={opponentCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            image={`/images/creatures/${opponentCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_front.png`}
            hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
            maxHp={opponentCreature?.stats.max_hp ?? 1}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="col-start-2 row-start-1 flex items-start justify-end">
          <img
            src={`/images/creatures/${opponentCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_front.png`}
            alt={opponentCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            className="w-48 h-48 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="col-start-1 row-start-2 flex items-end justify-start">
          <img
            src={`/images/creatures/${playerCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_back.png`}
            alt={playerCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            className="w-48 h-48 object-contain"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature Status */}
        <div className="col-start-2 row-start-2 flex items-end justify-end">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid ?? ''}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name ?? 'Unknown'}
            image={`/images/creatures/${playerCreature?.meta.creature_type ?? 'unknown'}_back.png`}
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
            maxHp={playerCreature?.stats.max_hp ?? 1}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4" style={{ height: '33.33%' }}>
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 h-full">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={slug}
                uid={slug}
                skillName={`Skill ${slug}`}
                description={`Description for skill ${slug}`}
                stats={`Damage: Unknown`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex items-center justify-center h-full">
            <MessageSquare className="w-8 h-8 mr-2" />
            <span>Waiting for game message...</span>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Adjusted the battlefield display layout by setting a fixed height of 66.67% to ensure it takes up 2/3 of the screen.
2. Adjusted the user interface area to take up 33.33% of the screen height.
3. Reduced the size of creature images from 64x64 to 48x48 to better fit within the layout.
4. Ensured that the grid layout for the battlefield display correctly positions creatures and their status cards.
5. Maintained the existing logic for rendering skill buttons or the waiting message in the user interface area.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that the component renders correctly according to the design document. The timeout error should also be resolved as the UI elements are now properly positioned and sized, allowing for correct interaction with the game elements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and adhering to the guidelines more closely.

# Excerpt ID: bfe11db4-094e-4f39-8ed3-83857805495f
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const playerName = props.data?.entities?.player?.display_name || "Player";
    const playerUid = props.data?.entities?.player?.uid || "default_uid";

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Creature Battle</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">Welcome, {playerName}!</div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center mb-16 space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid={`${playerUid}_play_button`}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid={`${playerUid}_quit_button`}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        variant="destructive"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues:

1. We've kept the original ExamplePlayer and GameUIData interfaces as provided in the boilerplate.
2. We're now passing a uid prop to the Button components, using the player's uid to create unique identifiers for each button.
3. We've maintained the existing imports and structure of the component.
4. We're using the GameUIData interface correctly, accessing the player data from props.data.entities.player.
5. We've kept the inline Tailwind styles to create the described view, maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio and full-screen layout.
6. We've implemented null checks and fallbacks for player name and uid to handle potential missing data.
7. The component still renders the game title prominently at the top and the play buttons at the bottom, as described in the VIEW_SUMMARY.

This version should now comply with all the guidelines and requirements provided.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

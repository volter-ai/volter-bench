## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the battlefield is not as described in the design document. The creatures should be spread out horizontally, but they appear to be too close together.

2. The skill buttons are not properly displayed. Only "Tackle" and "Quit" buttons are visible, while the code suggests there should be more skill buttons based on the player creature's skills.

3. The creature images are not loading correctly, showing only alt text.

4. The UI is not fully responsive, with a large amount of empty space at the bottom of the screen.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Adjust the layout of the battlefield to spread out the creatures horizontally.
2. Ensure that all skill buttons are properly rendered and clickable.
3. Fix the image loading for creatures by providing correct image URLs or fallback images.
4. Make the UI more responsive to utilize the full screen space.

Here's the implemented solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4bb08d8c-002e-4b00-a8b6-9c473a54faeb
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections?: {
    skills?: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-green-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Player</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Swords className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-red-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature.uid}
            name={opponentCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponentCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Opponent</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 border-t-2 border-gray-300">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 bg-gray-200 p-2 rounded overflow-y-auto">
          <p>Battle in progress...</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 justify-center">
          {playerCreature.collections?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill')}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('use-skill')}
            />
          ))}
          <SkillButton
            uid="quit-button"
            skillName="Quit"
            description="Exit the battle"
            stats=""
            disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit')}
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added `h-screen` to the main container to ensure it takes up the full height of the screen.
2. Added `maxHp` prop to `CreatureCard` components to display health correctly.
3. Changed the layout of the battlefield to use `justify-between` instead of `justify-around` to spread out the creatures more.
4. Added `justify-center` to the skill buttons container to ensure they're centered and visible.
5. Ensured that the `emitButtonClick` function is only called with available button slugs.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all elements are visible and interactive, potentially resolving the timeout error by making all necessary UI elements accessible for the UI simulator to interact with.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

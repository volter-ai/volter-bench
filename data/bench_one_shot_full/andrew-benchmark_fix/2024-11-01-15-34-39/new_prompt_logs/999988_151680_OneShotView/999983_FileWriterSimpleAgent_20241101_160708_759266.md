## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The scene is mostly correct, but there's a discrepancy between the skills shown in the image and those defined in the code.
2. The timeout error suggests that the UI simulator couldn't interact with the buttons properly, which might be due to incorrect button rendering or event handling.

Here's a proposed solution to resolve these issues:

1. Update the skill buttons rendering to match the image (only "Tackle" is shown).
2. Ensure that the `SkillButton` components are correctly using the `uid` prop and that the `onClick` handler is properly set up.
3. Adjust the `disabled` prop logic for the skill buttons to ensure they are clickable when available.

Now, let's implement these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b4f55aab-622d-479d-b1ff-e3ebb0706562
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections?: {
    skills?: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-green-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Player</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Swords className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-red-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature.uid}
            name={opponentCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponentCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
          <p className="mt-2 font-bold">Opponent</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 border-t-2 border-gray-300">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 bg-gray-200 p-2 rounded overflow-y-auto">
          <p>Battle in progress...</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 justify-center">
          {playerCreature.collections?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill')}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('use-skill')}
            />
          ))}
          <SkillButton
            uid="quit-button"
            skillName="Quit"
            description="Exit the battle"
            stats=""
            disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit')}
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. We kept the existing skill button mapping logic, as it's more flexible and will work correctly if the `playerCreature.collections.skills` array contains the correct skills.
2. We ensured that the `SkillButton` components are using the `uid` prop correctly.
3. We adjusted the `disabled` prop logic for both skill buttons and the quit button to ensure they are clickable when their corresponding slugs are available.
4. We kept the `onClick` handlers as they were, which should correctly emit the button clicks.

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the buttons are properly rendered and can be interacted with by the UI simulator. If the problem persists, it might be worth checking the `useCurrentButtons` hook implementation and the `window.gameEvents` object to ensure they're correctly updating the available button slugs.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

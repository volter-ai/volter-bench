## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and ensuring compliance with the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: b786d3f3-31e1-4ffe-bcb3-96589f99acc5
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
    switch (slug) {
      case 'play':
        return <Play className="mr-2" />;
      case 'quit':
        return <X className="mr-2" />;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] relative bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-8">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-8">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
            <button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 bg-white text-purple-600 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg uppercase tracking-wide transition-colors duration-200 hover:bg-purple-100"
            >
              {getButtonIcon(slug)}
              {slug}
            </button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This corrected version:

1. Keeps the commented-out import for the Card component from shadcn/ui, as it was in the original boilerplate.
2. Maintains the existing imports and named exports.
3. Implements the MainMenuSceneView component as before, which adheres to the VIEW_SUMMARY requirements.
4. Uses Tailwind CSS for styling to create the described view.
5. Handles potential missing data with fallbacks (e.g., for the game title).
6. Uses the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from useCurrentButtons() to dynamically render and handle button interactions.
7. Maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio for the game container.

Note that in this specific implementation, we don't use any custom UI components that would require a uid prop. If such components were to be added in the future, we would need to pass the uid prop to them.

This corrected version should now be compliant with the given guidelines and ready to use.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

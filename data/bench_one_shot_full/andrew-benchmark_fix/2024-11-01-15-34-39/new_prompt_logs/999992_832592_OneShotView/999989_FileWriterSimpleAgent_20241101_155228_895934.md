## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll correct the issues and provide an updated version of the MainGameScene component that fully complies with the guidelines. Here's the corrected code:

# Excerpt ID: 09bc7229-3abc-4703-be09-aa1e8417810f
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player, opponent, player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <PlayerCard
          uid={player.uid}
          playerName={player.display_name}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-player.jpg"
          className="w-auto h-12 flex items-center bg-blue-700"
        />
        <PlayerCard
          uid={opponent.uid}
          playerName={opponent.display_name}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-opponent.jpg"
          className="w-auto h-12 flex items-center bg-blue-700"
        />
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <CreatureCard
          uid={player_creature.uid}
          name={player_creature.display_name}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
          className="transform scale-x-[-1]"
        />
        <CreatureCard
          uid={opponent_creature.uid}
          name={opponent_creature.display_name}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 border-t border-gray-300">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 bg-gray-200 p-2 rounded overflow-y-auto">
          {/* Game description text would go here */}
          <p>Battle in progress...</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {player_creature.collections.skills.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill')}
            />
          ))}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="quit-button"
              skillName="Quit"
              description="Exit the current battle"
              stats=""
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600"
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. I've added the PlayerCard component and used it in the HUD for both the player and opponent.
2. I've updated the Creature interface to include the collections property with skills.
3. I've added a Player interface and updated the GameUIData interface to include player and opponent entities.
4. I've destructured the entities from props.data at the beginning of the component for cleaner access.
5. I've removed the optional chaining for accessing skills, as we now properly define the structure in our interfaces.

These changes ensure that we're using all custom components correctly, always passing the uid prop, and following the other guidelines. The code now properly handles the data structure we expect from the backend and uses the appropriate custom components for each data type.

Note that I've used placeholder image URLs for the PlayerCard components as well. You'll need to replace these with the correct image URLs or implement a way to get the correct images for each player and creature.

This version of the code should now fully comply with the guidelines and be ready to use.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The layout of the battlefield display is incorrect. The player and opponent creatures are in the wrong positions compared to the design document.
2. The skill buttons (Tackle and Lick) are not properly aligned in the 2x2 grid as specified in the design document.
3. The Back button is not correctly positioned and sized.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Swap the positions of the player and opponent creatures and their status displays in the battlefield area.
2. Adjust the grid layout for the user interface area to ensure all buttons, including skill buttons, are properly aligned in a 2x2 grid.
3. Ensure that all buttons, including the Back button, have consistent sizing and positioning.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: bb520a0a-ce58-4fd1-a5a7-4124f4a5217d
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, ArrowLeft, Repeat } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  entities: {
    active_creature: Creature;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const player = props.data.entities.player;
  const opponent = props.data.entities.opponent;
  const playerCreature = player.entities.active_creature;
  const opponentCreature = opponent.entities.active_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      {/* Battlefield Display */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4 p-4">
        {/* Opponent Creature Status */}
        <div className="col-start-1 row-start-1 flex justify-start items-start">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature?.uid || ''}
            name={opponentCreature?.display_name || 'Unknown'}
            image="/placeholder-opponent-creature.png"
            hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
            maxHp={opponentCreature?.stats.max_hp || 1}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="col-start-2 row-start-1 flex justify-end items-start">
          <PlayerCard
            uid={opponent.uid}
            playerName={opponent.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-opponent.png"
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature */}
        <div className="col-start-1 row-start-2 flex justify-start items-end">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid || ''}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name || 'Unknown'}
            image="/placeholder-player-creature.png"
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
            maxHp={playerCreature?.stats.max_hp || 1}
          />
        </div>

        {/* Player Creature Status */}
        <div className="col-start-2 row-start-2 flex justify-end items-end">
          <PlayerCard
            uid={player.uid}
            playerName={player.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-player.png"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-100 p-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2 gap-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack')} className="w-full h-full">
              <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Attack
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')} className="w-full h-full">
              <Repeat className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Swap
            </Button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')} className="w-full h-full">
              <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Back
            </Button>
          )}
          {playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Base Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.display_name.toLowerCase())}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The changes made include:

1. Swapped the positions of the player and opponent creatures and their status displays in the battlefield area.
2. Added `className="w-full h-full"` to all buttons in the user interface area to ensure consistent sizing and proper alignment in the 2x2 grid.
3. Kept the existing logic for rendering skill buttons, which should now align properly with the other buttons in the 2x2 grid.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that all elements are visible and properly positioned, which should prevent the timeout error caused by the UI simulator not being able to interact with the elements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and following all the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 26bbab44-b44f-48c1-9621-391b6abc95c8
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const player = props.data.entities.player;
    const playerName = player?.display_name || "Player";

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Game Title</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">
                Welcome, {playerName}!
                {player?.stats?.stat1 !== undefined && (
                    <div className="text-lg">Stat1: {player.stats.stat1}</div>
                )}
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid="play-button"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid="quit-button"
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues:

1. We've added the `uid` prop to the Button components.
2. We've kept the original interfaces (`ExamplePlayer`, `GameUIData`, and `SomeCustomType`) as they were in the boilerplate.
3. We're now using the `GameUIData` interface correctly, accessing the player data through `props.data.entities.player`.
4. We've implemented more null rendering fail-safes, such as checking for the existence of `player.stats.stat1` before rendering it.
5. We've maintained the existing imports and named exports as required.
6. We're still using inline Tailwind styles to create the described view, maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio for the game container.
7. We're checking for the availability of 'play' and 'quit' buttons using `availableButtonSlugs`.
8. We're using the `emitButtonClick` function to handle button clicks.

This version should now comply with all the guidelines provided while maintaining the desired functionality and appearance of the main menu scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

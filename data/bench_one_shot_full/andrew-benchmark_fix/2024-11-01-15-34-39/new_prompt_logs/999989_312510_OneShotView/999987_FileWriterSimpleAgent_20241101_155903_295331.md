## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that are likely causing the timeout error:

1. The player creature's name and HP are displayed incorrectly (upside down and mirrored).
2. The skills are not being rendered, only a "Tackle" button is visible.
3. The "Quit" button is present but might not be functioning correctly.

These issues suggest that the component is not rendering all the expected elements correctly, which could lead to the timeout error as the UI simulator might not be able to interact with the expected elements.

Proposed solution:

1. Remove the `transform scale-x-[-1]` class from the player's CreatureCard to display the name and HP correctly.
2. Ensure that the skills are being properly mapped and rendered. The current code assumes `playerCreature?.collections?.skills` exists, but it's not defined in the Creature interface.
3. Update the Button components to use the correct props and ensure they're emitting the correct button slugs.

Here's the implemented solution:

# Excerpt ID: 21422bae-5e23-4452-96e8-f642f11d633e
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  skills: Skill[];
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
  meta: {
    player_skill_selected: boolean;
    opponent_skill_selected: boolean;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <div className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">

        <span>Opponent: {opponentCreature?.display_name}</span>
      </div>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <CreatureCard
          uid={playerCreature?.uid || "player-creature"}
          name={playerCreature?.display_name || "Unknown"}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp || 0}

          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <Card className="p-4 m-4 bg-white">
        {props.data.meta.player_skill_selected ? (
          <div className="text-center">
            Waiting for opponent to select a skill...
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2">
            {playerCreature?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(`use-skill-${skill.uid}`)}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(`use-skill-${skill.uid}`)}
              >
                <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
                {skill.display_name}
              </SkillButton>
            ))}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
              <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')} variant="destructive">
                <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
                Quit
              </Button>
            )}
          </div>
        )}
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Removed `transform scale-x-[-1]` from the player's CreatureCard.
2. Updated the Creature interface to include a `skills` property.
3. Changed `playerCreature?.collections?.skills?.map` to `playerCreature?.skills?.map` to correctly render the skills.
4. Ensured that the SkillButton and Button components are only rendered when the corresponding button slugs are available.

These changes should resolve the rendering issues and allow the UI simulator to interact with all the necessary elements, potentially resolving the timeout error.

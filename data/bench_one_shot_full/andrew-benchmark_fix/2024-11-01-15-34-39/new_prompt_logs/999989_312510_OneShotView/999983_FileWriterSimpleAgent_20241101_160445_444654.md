## Proposed Code Change
Based on the image and the error message, there are a few issues with the current scene:

1. The skill buttons for the player creature are missing. The UI only shows a "Quit" button.
2. The timeout error suggests that the UI simulator couldn't interact with the expected elements within the given time frame.

These issues could be causing the UI simulator to fail because it's unable to find and interact with the skill buttons, which are essential for gameplay progression.

Proposed solution:

1. Ensure that the player creature's skills are being properly rendered.
2. Add a check to render a message when there are no skills available.
3. Adjust the layout to ensure all elements are visible and accessible.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 755b075b-8eba-4b61-bcb8-536ec91f0a9e
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;

    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  skills: Skill[];
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;

  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
  meta: {
    player_skill_selected: boolean;
    opponent_skill_selected: boolean;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <div className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">

      </div>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <CreatureCard
          uid={playerCreature?.uid || "player-creature"}

          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <Card className="p-4 m-4 bg-white">
        {props.data.meta.player_skill_selected ? (
          <div className="text-center">
            Waiting for opponent to select a skill...
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2">
            {playerCreature?.skills && playerCreature.skills.length > 0 ? (
              playerCreature.skills.map((skill: Skill) => {
                const skillSlug = `use-skill-${skill.uid}`;
                return (
                  <SkillButton
                    key={skill.uid}
                    uid={skill.uid}
                    skillName={skill.display_name}
                    description={skill.description}
                    stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skillSlug)}
                    disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillSlug)}
                  >
                    <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
                    {skill.display_name}
                  </SkillButton>
                );
              })
            ) : (
              <div className="text-center">No skills available</div>
            )}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
              <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')} variant="destructive">
                <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
                Quit
              </Button>
            )}
          </div>
        )}
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added a check to ensure that `playerCreature.skills` exists and has elements before mapping over it.
2. Added a fallback message "No skills available" when there are no skills to display.
3. Moved the "Quit" button outside of the skills mapping to ensure it's always visible.

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that the UI always has interactive elements (either skill buttons or a message) and that the "Quit" button is always available. This should prevent the UI simulator from timing out due to a lack of interactive elements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The skill buttons for the player creature are missing from the UI.
2. The "Quit" button is present, but it's the only visible button in the user interface area.
3. The creature cards are displayed correctly, but there's no interaction available for the player.

These issues suggest that the game is not providing the expected interactive elements, which could lead to the timeout error as the UI simulator cannot find or interact with the necessary elements.

Proposed solution:

1. Ensure that the player creature's skills are properly mapped and displayed.
2. Add a check to display the skill buttons only when they are available.
3. Adjust the layout to ensure all elements are visible and accessible.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2a66ff57-86c6-4a1b-a8a4-7632591371e4
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  skills: Skill[];
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
  meta: {
    player_skill_selected: boolean;
    opponent_skill_selected: boolean;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <div className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <span>Player: {playerCreature?.display_name}</span>
        <span>VS</span>
        <span>Opponent: {opponentCreature?.display_name}</span>
      </div>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <CreatureCard
          uid={playerCreature?.uid || "player-creature"}
          name={playerCreature?.display_name || "Unknown"}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
        />
        <div className="text-4xl font-bold">VS</div>
        <CreatureCard
          uid={opponentCreature?.uid || "opponent-creature"}
          name={opponentCreature?.display_name || "Unknown"}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
          hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <Card className="p-4 m-4 bg-white">
        {props.data.meta.player_skill_selected ? (
          <div className="text-center">
            Waiting for opponent to select a skill...
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2">
            {playerCreature?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => {
              const skillSlug = `use-skill-${skill.uid}`;
              return (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skillSlug)}
                  disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillSlug)}
                >
                  <Sword className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
                  {skill.display_name}
                </SkillButton>
              );
            })}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
              <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')} variant="destructive">
                <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
                Quit
              </Button>
            )}
          </div>
        )}
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. In the skill button mapping, I've added a check to ensure that the skill buttons are only clickable when their corresponding slug is in the `availableButtonSlugs` array.
2. I've moved the creation of the `skillSlug` inside the mapping function to ensure it's correctly formed for each skill.
3. The `emitButtonClick` function now uses the `skillSlug` instead of constructing it inline, which ensures consistency.

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that all interactive elements are properly displayed and only enabled when they're available for interaction. This should prevent the timeout error by giving the UI simulator the necessary elements to interact with.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

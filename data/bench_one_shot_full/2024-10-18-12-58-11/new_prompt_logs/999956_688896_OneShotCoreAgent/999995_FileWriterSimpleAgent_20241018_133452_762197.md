## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the run method to properly handle the end of the battle and transition to the next scene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 17c4aeb3-cdcb-4f1e-b585-d1191eb2610c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            self.check_battle_end()

        # After battle ends, transition back to main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True

        if self.battle_ended:
            # Reset creature HP for the next battle
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the battle until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating `check_battle_end` to set the `battle_ended` flag and reset creature HP.
4. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly by transitioning to another scene, fixing both the random run test and the full game flow test. The game will now correctly cycle between the main menu and battles, providing a complete game loop.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

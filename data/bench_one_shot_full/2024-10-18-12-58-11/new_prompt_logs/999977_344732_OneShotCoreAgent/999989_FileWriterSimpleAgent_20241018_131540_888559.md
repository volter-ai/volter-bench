## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The main problem is that the `MainGameScene` is not properly exiting when the battle ends. We need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. We'll modify the `game_loop` method to call this new method when the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the scene transitions or quits the game appropriately.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a4cb6b70-c636-4001-b3fa-4efbaff79917
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.opponent_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self):
        player_tuple = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        opponent_tuple = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return player_tuple, opponent_tuple
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return opponent_tuple, player_tuple
        else:
            return random.choice([(player_tuple, opponent_tuple), (opponent_tuple, player_tuple)])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. Modifying the `game_loop` method to break the loop and call `end_battle` when `check_battle_end` returns True.
3. In the `end_battle` method, we give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
4. Based on the player's choice, we either transition back to the main menu or quit the whole game.

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve the FixableException and make the tests pass.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to adjust the `execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to access the `attack` attribute on the `Player` object, which doesn't exist. Instead, we should be using the active creature's attributes for the battle calculations.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `MainGameScene` class, we'll modify the `execute_skill` method to use the active creature's attributes instead of the player's.
2. We'll update the `resolve_turn` method to pass the correct attacker and defender creatures to `execute_skill`.
3. We'll adjust the `determine_turn_order` method to return the correct creature objects instead of player objects.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 6058e359-31b0-4d8d-be2f-271f4aaccda2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:

        else:

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError we were encountering. The main modifications are:

1. In the `determine_turn_order` method, we now return tuples containing the creature objects instead of the player objects.
2. The `execute_skill` method now takes `Creature` objects as the attacker and defender, allowing us to access their attributes correctly.
3. The `resolve_turn` method now unpacks the correct objects when calling `execute_skill`.

These modifications ensure that we're using the creature's attributes for battle calculations instead of trying to access non-existent attributes on the Player object. This should fix the AttributeError and allow the game to run properly.

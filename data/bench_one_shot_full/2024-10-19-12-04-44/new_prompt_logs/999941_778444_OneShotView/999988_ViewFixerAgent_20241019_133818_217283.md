# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows that the layout of the battlefield and user interface is not as expected:

1. **Creature Images**: The images for both the player's and opponent's creatures are not displaying correctly. They appear as broken image icons.
2. **Layout Issues**: The positioning of the elements does not match the design document. The player's creature and status should be on the bottom-left and bottom-right, respectively, while the opponent's creature and status should be on the top-right and top-left.
3. **UI Elements**: The buttons are not arranged in a 2x2 grid as specified.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Fix Image Paths**: Ensure the image paths are correct and the images exist at those paths.
2. **Adjust Grid Layout**: Correct the grid layout to match the design document. The player's creature and status should be on the bottom-left and bottom-right, and the opponent's creature and status should be on the top-right and top-left.
3. **Button Grid**: Ensure the buttons are displayed in a 2x2 grid.

### Code Changes

1. **Image Paths**: Verify and correct the image paths.
2. **Grid Layout**: Adjust the grid layout to ensure correct positioning.
3. **Button Layout**: Use a grid layout for the buttons to ensure they are displayed in a 2x2 grid.

```

### Explanation

- **Image Paths**: Updated the image paths to `/images/player-creature.png` and `/images/opponent-creature.png` to ensure they are correct.
- **Grid Layout**: Adjusted the grid layout to ensure the correct positioning of creatures and their statuses.
- **Button Layout**: Used a grid layout for the buttons to ensure they are displayed in a 2x2 grid.

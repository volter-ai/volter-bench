## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each of these problems while staying within the capabilities of the engine and respecting the existing architecture. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Prioritize swaps over attacks in the resolution phase.
3. Implement random turn order for creatures with the same speed.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 39f65c57-37df-4317-a722-b4668a685483

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. A 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choice phases, allowing players to return to the main choice menu.
2. The resolution phase now prioritizes swaps over attacks. All swap actions are executed before any attack actions.
3. For creatures with the same speed, a random factor is now used to determine the order of attacks.

These changes align the implementation with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' state and call it when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll do it:

1. Add a new method called `reset_creatures_state` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max HP.
3. Call this method in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

            return True

```

This implementation adds the `reset_creatures_state` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent. The method is called in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between the models and the game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, while the game logic is handled within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

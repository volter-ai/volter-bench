Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10,
                "attack": 3,
                "defense": 2,
                "speed": 4
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature",
                "creature_type": "water"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill",
                      "skill_type": "normal"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  },
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 2
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "lick",
                      "category": "Skill",
                      "skill_type": "water"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
                    "display_name": "Lick",
                    "description": "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A water-type creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "The human player"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "ad727587-a8b0-5bad-de3c-3da9ccb39601",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with two main sections:
     - Top section for title (centered)
     - Bottom section for buttons (centered)
   - Background styling for the menu

2. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with proper aspect ratio constraints
   - Title section taking about 1/3 of vertical space
   - Button section taking about 1/3 of vertical space at bottom
   - Spacing in between for visual balance

3. **Styling Strategy**:
   Using Tailwind classes for:
   - Flexbox layout (`flex`, `flex-col`, `justify-between`)
   - Centering (`items-center`, `justify-center`)
   - Spacing (`p-8`, `gap-4`)
   - Background effects (`bg-gradient-to-b`)
   - Responsive design (`w-full`, `h-full`)

4. **Button Implementation**:
   - Map through available buttons from `availableButtonSlugs`
   - Use conditional rendering with optional chaining
   - Implement click handlers with `emitButtonClick`

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Play, XCircle} from 'lucide-react'

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: {
            uid: string,
            stats: Record<string, number>,
            meta: Record<string, string>,
            entities: Record<string, unknown>,
            collections: Record<string, unknown>,
            display_name: string,
            description: string
        }
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const buttonConfig = {
        play: { icon: Play, label: 'Play Game' },
        quit: { icon: XCircle, label: 'Quit Game' }
    }

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
            <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
            </div>

            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs?.map(buttonId => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[buttonId as keyof typeof buttonConfig]
                    if (!config) return null

                    const Icon = config.icon

                    return (
                        <button
                            key={buttonId}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(buttonId)}
                            className="flex items-center gap-3 px-8 py-4 bg-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-600 
                                     text-white rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200 min-w-[200px]
                                     justify-center"
                        >
                            <Icon size={24} />
                            <span className="text-xl">{config.label}</span>
                        </button>
                    )
                })}
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen container with a dark gradient background
- Centers the title in the upper portion
- Places buttons in the bottom portion with proper spacing
- Includes icons from Lucide for visual enhancement
- Handles button clicks through the provided `emitButtonClick`
- Uses responsive design principles
- Maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio through container constraints
- Provides visual feedback on button hover
- Safely handles missing button configurations
- Uses a clean, modern gaming UI aesthetic

The component is also type-safe and handles potential missing data gracefully.

  "explanation": "Let me check the guidelines and requirements:\n\n1. Missing Requirements:\n- We didn't pass any uid prop to custom components (though we aren't using any in this case)\n- The GameUIData interface should be more complete based on the VIEW_DATA example - it's missing collections, meta, and other fields\n- We should preserve more of the type structure from the example data\n\n2. Good Points:\n- We kept the named exports and existing imports\n- We used elvis operators and null checks for safety\n- We only used existing UI components (just basic HTML elements)\n- We properly used Lucide-React icons\n- We implemented the layout according to the VIEW_SUMMARY\n- We handled the button system correctly\n\n3. Areas to Fix:\n- Need to expand the GameUIData interface to match the example data\n- Should add interfaces for the nested types (Creature, Skill, etc.)\n- Should ensure the component handles all possible data scenarios\n\nThe code needs revision to be fully compliant with the requirements.",

                })}
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Key improvements in this version:
1. Added proper type interfaces matching the VIEW_DATA structure
2. All entities inherit from BaseEntity interface
3. Proper typing for nested structures (Skill, Creature, Player)
4. Added proper null checks for data access
5. Enhanced UI with:
   - Depth overlay
   - Z-index management
   - Group hover effects
   - Scale transitions
   - Button animations
   - Maximum width constraints
6. Maintained 16:9 aspect ratio through container classes
7. Uses the scene's display_name if available
8. Added proper type safety throughout
9. Preserved all required imports and exports
10. Maintained compatibility with the button system

The component now properly represents the data structure while providing a polished gaming UI experience.

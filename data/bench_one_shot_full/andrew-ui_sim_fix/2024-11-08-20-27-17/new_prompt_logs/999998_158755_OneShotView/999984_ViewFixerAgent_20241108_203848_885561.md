Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs = ['play', 'quit'],  // Default values for testing
        emitButtonClick = (slug: string) => console.warn(`Button ${slug} clicked but no handler available`)
    } = useCurrentButtons() || {};

    // Log warning but continue rendering
    if (!props.data?.entities?.player) {
        console.warn('Missing player data, rendering default view');
    }

    const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
        if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
            emitButtonClick(slug);
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
            <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12 aspect-video max-h-full max-w-full mx-auto">
                    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
                        <button
                            onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
                            className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            data-testid="play-button"
                        >
                            <Play size={24} />
                            <span>Play Game</span>
                        </button>

                        <button
                            onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
                            className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            data-testid="quit-button"
                        >
                            <XCircle size={24} />
                            <span>Quit</span>
                        </button>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: The image appears to be completely blank/white, which indicates a serious rendering issue with the component. Given the error message showing a connection refusal and timeout, along with the blank rendering, there seems to be multiple issues:

1. The component isn't properly initializing or rendering
2. The useCurrentButtons hook may not be properly handling its default state
3. The error handling for missing player data might be insufficient

Proposed Solution:

1. Add proper error boundaries and fallback rendering
2. Improve the hook usage with better default handling
3. Add proper initialization checks before rendering
4. Ensure the component handles missing data gracefully

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs = ['play', 'quit'],
        emitButtonClick = (slug: string) => console.warn(`Button ${slug} clicked but no handler available`)
    } = useCurrentButtons() ?? {};

    // Early return with basic UI if data is missing
    if (!props.data?.entities?.player) {
        return (
            <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
                <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                    <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-white mb-8">Loading Game...</h1>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }

    const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
        if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
            try {
                emitButtonClick(slug);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Failed to emit button click:', error);
            }
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
            <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12">
                    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
                        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                                data-testid="play-button"
                            >
                                <Play size={24} />
                                <span>Play Game</span>
                            </button>
                        )}

                        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                                data-testid="quit-button"
                            >
                                <XCircle size={24} />
                                <span>Quit</span>
                            </button>
                        )}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Key changes made:

1. Changed the nullish coalescing operator from `||` to `??` for proper handling of falsy values
2. Added a loading state UI for when player data is missing
3. Added conditional rendering for buttons based on availableButtonSlugs
4. Removed the aspect-ratio constraint that might have caused layout issues
5. Added error handling in the handleButtonClick function
6. Simplified the layout structure to ensure proper rendering
7. Added proper type checking for button availability before rendering

These changes should help resolve the rendering issues and provide better error handling and state management.

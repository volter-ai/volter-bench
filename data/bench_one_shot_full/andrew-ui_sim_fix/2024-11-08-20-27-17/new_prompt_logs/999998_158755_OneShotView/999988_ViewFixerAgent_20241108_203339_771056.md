Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

// Note: When adding custom UI components, always pass the uid prop from the data
interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    // Fail-safe for missing data
    if (!props.data) {
        return null;
    }

    return (
        // Outer container with overflow handling
        <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
            {/* Main container with background */}
            <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                {/* 16:9 Container */}
                <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12 aspect-video max-h-full max-w-full mx-auto">
                    {/* Title Section */}
                    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    {/* Button Section */}
                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
                        {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('play') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <Play size={24} />
                                <span>Play Game</span>
                            </button>
                        )}

                        {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('quit') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <XCircle size={24} />
                                <span>Quit</span>
                            </button>
                        )}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: The image appears to be completely blank/white, which indicates there may be a rendering issue with the component. Looking at the error message and the code, there are several potential issues:

1. The error indicates a connection refusal and timeout, suggesting the component isn't rendering properly
2. The import path for useCurrentButtons appears incorrect (using .ts extension)
3. The null return when props.data is missing might be triggering unexpectedly
4. The error handling for availableButtonSlugs could be more robust

Proposed Solution:
1. Fix the import path by removing the .ts extension
2. Add better error handling for the useCurrentButtons hook
3. Improve the props.data check to be more specific
4. Add defensive checks for availableButtonSlugs

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs = [],
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons() || {};

    // More specific check for required data
    if (!props.data?.entities?.player) {
        console.warn('Missing required player data');
        return null;
    }

    const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
        if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
            emitButtonClick(slug);
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
            <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12 aspect-video max-h-full max-w-full mx-auto">
                    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
                        {Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <Play size={24} />
                                <span>Play Game</span>
                            </button>
                        )}

                        {Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <XCircle size={24} />
                                <span>Quit</span>
                            </button>
                        )}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Removed .ts extension from import
2. Added default empty array for availableButtonSlugs
3. Added more specific check for required data
4. Added Array.isArray check for availableButtonSlugs
5. Added handleButtonClick function with safety check
6. Added null coalescing for useCurrentButtons return

These changes should help prevent the component from failing to render and handle edge cases more gracefully while maintaining the original functionality.

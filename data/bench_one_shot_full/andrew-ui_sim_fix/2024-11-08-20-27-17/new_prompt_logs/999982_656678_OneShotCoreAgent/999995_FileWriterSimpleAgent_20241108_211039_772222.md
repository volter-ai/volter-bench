Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that `_show_text()` is missing a required positional argument 'text'. Looking at the engine code, `_show_text` requires both a player and text argument. In the MainGameScene, we're calling it with just the text. We need to specify which player should receive the text message.

For battle messages, both players (human and bot) should see the messages, so we need to call `_show_text` for both players. This follows the architecture principle that bots should be treated exactly like players.

2. Fix for main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: 1a4633c7-f51f-4ff4-9a38-6d1b87c1355b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        battle_start_text = f"Battle Start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.bot.display_name}"
        self._show_text(self.player, battle_start_text)
        self._show_text(self.bot, battle_start_text)
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self.determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.bot, self.bot_creature, bot_skill)
            )
            
            # Execute moves
            for attacker, creature, skill in [first, second]:
                if attacker == self.player:
                    defender = self.bot
                    defender_creature = self.bot_creature
                else:
                    defender = self.player
                    defender_creature = self.player_creature
                    
                damage = skill.base_damage + creature.attack - defender_creature.defense
                defender_creature.hp -= max(1, damage)
                
                attack_text = f"{creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!"
                damage_text = f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!"
                
                # Show messages to both players
                self._show_text(attacker, attack_text)
                self._show_text(defender, attack_text)
                self._show_text(attacker, damage_text)
                self._show_text(defender, damage_text)
                
                if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                    if defender_creature == self.player_creature:
                        result_text = "You lost!"
                        self._show_text(self.player, result_text)
                        self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
                    else:
                        result_text = "You won!"
                        self._show_text(self.player, result_text)
                        self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

    def determine_order(self, move1, move2):
        p1_creature = move1[1]
        p2_creature = move2[1]
        
        if p1_creature.speed > p2_creature.speed:
            return move1, move2
        elif p2_creature.speed > p1_creature.speed:
            return move2, move1
        else:
            return random.choice([(move1, move2), (move2, move1)])
```

The key changes:
1. Added player argument to all `_show_text` calls
2. Show battle messages to both players
3. Customize win/loss messages per player
4. Made variable names clearer (attacker/defender)

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both human and bot players in the same way.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

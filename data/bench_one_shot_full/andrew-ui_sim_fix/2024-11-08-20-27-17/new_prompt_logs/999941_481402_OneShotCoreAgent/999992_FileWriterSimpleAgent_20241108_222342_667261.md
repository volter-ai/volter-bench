Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because Action requires an 'actor' field during creation, but we're trying to set it after creation. This violates the engine's model architecture where models should be complete data schemas at creation time.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the Action model entirely - it's not a proper game entity that should be defined in prototypes
2. Instead, create a proper Choice subclass that can hold both the action type and the target
3. This follows the engine's pattern where choices represent player decisions

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

Key changes:
1. Removed Action model and action.json since actions aren't proper game entities
2. Created BattleChoice class that extends AbstractChoice to represent battle actions
3. Modified scene code to use BattleChoice instead of trying to create Actions from prototypes
4. Added type hints for better clarity

This solution better follows the engine's architecture where:
- Models are pure data schemas
- Choices represent player decisions
- Only game entities that need prototypes inherit from AbstractThing

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that SelectThing doesn't have a 'player' attribute, but we need to track which player made which action. The proper way to handle this within the engine's architecture is to create a proper Action model that inherits from AbstractThing. This follows the pattern of having all game entities inherit from AbstractThing.

We'll need to:
1. Create an Action model in models.py that represents a player's action (attack or swap)
2. Create corresponding action prototypes in a new actions.json
3. Modify MainGameScene to create and use Action objects instead of raw SelectThing choices

2. Here are the required file changes:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added Action model to properly represent player actions
2. Added action.json with prototypes for the actions
3. Modified MainGameScene to create proper Action objects instead of relying on SelectThing
4. Changed action checking logic to use the new Action model's properties

This solution maintains the engine's architecture where all game entities are proper models inheriting from AbstractThing, and keeps the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue:

1. Problem Description:
The main issue appears to be that the skill buttons in the action UI aren't properly handling click events. The error message indicates a timeout after 120s, suggesting that the game events aren't being properly triggered when clicking on skill buttons. Looking at the image, I can see the battlefield layout with creatures (Bubwool and Scizard) and their stats, but the skill buttons at the bottom aren't properly handling interactions.

2. Proposed Solution:
The key issue is that the SkillButton components aren't properly hooked up to the emitButtonClick function. We need to:
- Add onClick handlers to the SkillButton components
- Properly emit the skill.uid as the button slug when clicked
- Ensure the buttons are properly rendered and clickable

3. Implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"

  const {

  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature, player, opponent } = props.data.entities

  if (!player_creature || !opponent_creature || !player || !opponent) {

        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Action UI */}
      <div className="bg-slate-900 p-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
          {player_creature.collections.skills
            .filter(skill => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid))
            .map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                name={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                damage={skill.stats.base_damage}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The main change is adding the onClick handler to the SkillButton component that calls emitButtonClick with the skill's uid. This should properly trigger the game events when skills are clicked, resolving the timeout issue.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the battle ends. According to the engine architecture, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly handles both TransitionFromScene and RandomModeGracefulExit. For MainGameScene, we need to:
- Catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test
- Keep the RandomModeGracefulExit catch for when the random counter expires
- Print appropriate debug messages for both cases

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 1ab5aeaf-2756-499b-b9b9-caeed683e13e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"battle ended normally in run {i}")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added try/except block to catch _QuitWholeGame
3. Added debug print for normal battle end
4. Kept the RandomModeGracefulExit catch for when random moves run out

This maintains the same game logic but properly handles the expected exception from the engine when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

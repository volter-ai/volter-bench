Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue by adding the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the documentation.

The fix needs to:
1. Add "Back" option when showing skills or swap choices
2. Return to main choice menu (Attack/Swap) when Back is selected
3. Stay within engine capabilities using Button for the Back option
4. Keep models as pure data schemas
5. Only modify the MainGameScene since this is a UI flow issue

Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

```

Key changes:
1. Modified get_player_action() to add a while True loop for human players to handle Back navigation
2. Added Back button option to both Attack and Swap choice menus
3. When Back is selected, continue the loop to return to main choice menu
4. Kept bot logic unchanged since it doesn't need Back functionality
5. Used engine's Button class for Back option to stay within capabilities
6. No changes to models since this is purely a UI flow change

This implements the "Back" option requirement while maintaining the architecture and staying within engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. According to the engine requirements, every scene must end with one of these calls.

The solution is to modify MainGameScene to:
1. When battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene if player won
2. Or quit the whole game if player lost
3. Keep all the existing battle logic intact
4. Not modify any models
5. Stay within engine capabilities

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 0be738d2-3b5c-4f1e-bbbb-7c08a118c066
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent choice phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
                self._quit_whole_game()
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        factor = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": factor = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": factor = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": factor = 0.5
            
        return int(raw_damage * factor)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill
        
        # If speeds are equal, randomize
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first
                first_skill, second_skill = second_skill, first_skill

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, first_skill), (second, first, second_skill)]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")
```

Key changes:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end` method and integrated win condition directly in main loop
2. Added proper scene transitions:
   - On win: Return to main menu
   - On loss: Quit the game
3. Removed the break statement that was causing the issue
4. Kept all game logic intact
5. Maintained proper model separation

This should resolve the FixableException by ensuring the scene always ends with a proper transition or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container (16:9 aspect ratio)
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (1/3 height)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative (1/3 height)
     - Bottom: Button area (1/3 height)

2. **Styling Approach**:
   - Using Tailwind classes for:
     - Flexbox layout (`flex`, `flex-col`)
     - Positioning (`justify-center`, `items-center`)
     - Spacing (`gap-4`, `p-4`)
     - Background effects (`bg-gradient-to-b`)
   - Responsive design using Tailwind's responsive prefixes

3. **Component Structure**:
   - Main container with aspect ratio lock
   - Title section with game name
   - Button section with dynamic button rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`
   - Safe rendering with optional chaining

4. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Button clicks managed through `emitButtonClick`
   - Available buttons filtered through `availableButtonSlugs`

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: Player;
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
            <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                    CREATURE BATTLE
                </h1>
            </div>

            <div className="flex-1" />

            <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="flex items-center gap-2 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white px-8 py-4 rounded-lg text-xl font-bold transition-colors"
                    >
                        <Play className="w-6 h-6" />
                        Play Game
                    </button>
                )}

                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        className="flex items-center gap-2 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white px-8 py-4 rounded-lg text-xl font-bold transition-colors"
                    >
                        <XCircle className="w-6 h-6" />
                        Quit
                    </button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen container with a dark gradient background
- Centers the title "CREATURE BATTLE" in the top third
- Places interactive buttons in the bottom third
- Uses Lucide icons for visual enhancement
- Implements responsive button rendering based on available actions
- Maintains 16:9 aspect ratio with `aspect-video`
- Uses Tailwind for all styling
- Handles button clicks through the provided `emitButtonClick` function
- Safely checks for button availability before rendering
- Uses a minimal interface structure focusing only on required data

The buttons are styled with hover effects and proper spacing, and the layout is fully responsive while maintaining the game's aspect ratio.

                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added proper interfaces reflecting the full data structure from VIEW_DATA
2. Used shadcn Button component instead of HTML buttons
3. Added proper null checking with elvis operators
4. Used dynamic title from props.data
5. Maintained proper typing throughout
6. Kept the 16:9 aspect ratio requirement
7. Used proper variant props on the Button components
8. Maintained the layout requirements from VIEW_SUMMARY
9. Kept all required imports while removing unused ones

The component now properly handles the data structure shown in VIEW_DATA while maintaining the visual requirements from VIEW_SUMMARY.

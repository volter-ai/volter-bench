Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being provided during initialization. The error occurs because we defined `active_creature` as `Creature | None` without specifying a default value.

To fix this, we need to:
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Make `active_creature` optional by setting it to `None` by default in the model definition
- Add `active_creature` to the player JSON data with `null` as the value

This follows the engine's capabilities since:
- We're keeping models as pure data schemas
- We're properly inheriting from AbstractPlayer
- We're using the engine's type system correctly
- We're letting the JSON data define the initial state

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: bef41679-d56b-4b55-ba11-c83e05489c86
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = None
```

# Excerpt ID: 358ca209-cea6-4165-aeff-cbf4f7d0f7bd
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": null
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": null
    }
  }
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `= None` default value to `active_creature` in the Player model
2. Added `"active_creature": null` to both player prototypes in the JSON

This ensures the model validation will pass since the optional field now has a default value, while maintaining the pure data schema approach required by the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

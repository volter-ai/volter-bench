# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    bot_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  // Safely access entities with type checking
  const playerCreature = props.data?.entities?.player_creature
  const botCreature = props.data?.entities?.bot_creature
  const player = props.data?.entities?.player
  
  if (!playerCreature || playerCreature.__type !== "Creature" ||
      !botCreature || botCreature.__type !== "Creature" ||
      !player || player.__type !== "Player") {
    return <div className="h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center">

    </div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)) {
      emitButtonClick(skillUid)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full flex flex-col">

              imageUrl="/creature.png"
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </main>

      <section className="h-1/3 bg-secondary/10 p-4 flex flex-col gap-4">
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 justify-center">

            ) : null
          )}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and error, there appear to be several problems:

1. The UI simulator is timing out after 120s, suggesting it cannot find or interact with clickable elements
2. The skills section shows only a single "Tackle" button, but the code suggests there should be multiple skill buttons from the creature's skills collection
3. The error suggests connection issues with source maps, which could indicate build/bundling problems

The main gameplay issue seems to be that the skills aren't being properly rendered or aren't interactive enough for the UI simulator to work with them.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. Add proper null checking for the skills collection
2. Ensure skill buttons are properly mapped with all required properties
3. Add aria-labels and proper button roles for better accessibility/testability
4. Adjust the layout to ensure buttons are clearly visible and clickable
5. Add error boundaries around the skills section

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

    damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    bot_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data?.entities?.player_creature
  const botCreature = props.data?.entities?.bot_creature
  const player = props.data?.entities?.player
  
  if (!playerCreature || playerCreature.__type !== "Creature" ||
      !botCreature || botCreature.__type !== "Creature" ||
      !player || player.__type !== "Player") {
    return <div className="h-screen w-full flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading game data...
    </div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)) {
      emitButtonClick(skillUid)
    }
  }

  const skills = playerCreature.collections?.skills?.filter(skill => 
    skill && skill.__type === "Skill"
  ) || []

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full flex flex-col">
      <nav className="h-16 bg-primary/10 flex items-center justify-between px-4">
        <PlayerCard
          uid={player.uid}

          <Shield className="w-6 h-6" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      <main className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-between px-8">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <span className="text-lg font-bold">Your Creature</span>
          <CreatureCard

            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl="/creature.png"
          />
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <span className="text-lg font-bold">Opponent's Creature</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={botCreature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl="/creature.png"
          />
        </div>
      </main>

      <section className="h-1/3 bg-secondary/10 p-4 flex flex-col gap-4" role="region" aria-label="Skills">
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 justify-center">
          {skills.length > 0 ? (
            skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                name={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
                onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))
          ) : (
            <div>No skills available</div>
          )}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added proper skills filtering and null checking
2. Removed redundant type checks since we already validate at the top
3. Added proper role and aria-label to the skills section
4. Added a fallback UI for when no skills are available
5. Simplified the skills mapping logic
6. Ensured all custom UI components receive their required uid prop

These changes should make the UI more stable and testable, resolving the timeout issues in the UI simulator.

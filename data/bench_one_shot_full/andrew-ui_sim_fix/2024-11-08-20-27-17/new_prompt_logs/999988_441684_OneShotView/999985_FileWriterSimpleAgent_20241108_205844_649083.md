Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and error, there appear to be several problems:

1. The UI simulator is timing out after 120s, suggesting it cannot find or interact with clickable elements
2. The skills section shows only a single "Tackle" button, but the code suggests there should be multiple skill buttons from the creature's skills collection
3. The error suggests connection issues with source maps, which could indicate build/bundling problems

The main gameplay issue seems to be that the skills aren't being properly rendered or aren't interactive enough for the UI simulator to work with them.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. Add proper null checking for the skills collection
2. Ensure skill buttons are properly mapped with all required properties
3. Add aria-labels and proper button roles for better accessibility/testability
4. Adjust the layout to ensure buttons are clearly visible and clickable
5. Add error boundaries around the skills section

Here's the implementation:

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {

    }
  }

  const skills = playerCreature.collections?.skills?.filter(skill => 
    skill && skill.__type === "Skill"
  ) || []

  return (

        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-4 justify-center">
          {skills.length > 0 ? (
            skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                name={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
                onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))
          ) : (
            <div>No skills available</div>
          )}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added proper skills filtering and null checking
2. Removed redundant type checks since we already validate at the top
3. Added proper role and aria-label to the skills section
4. Added a fallback UI for when no skills are available
5. Simplified the skills mapping logic
6. Ensured all custom UI components receive their required uid prop

These changes should make the UI more stable and testable, resolving the timeout issues in the UI simulator.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle is ending without properly handling the game flow.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. After a battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the main menu.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Here's the revised `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: 53e9aba8-5760-4e0c-8290-8e209cb380a4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, skill: Skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle continues until one of the creatures' HP reaches 0.
2. When the battle ends, it shows the appropriate message to the player.
3. After showing the result, it resets the creatures' HP and transitions back to the main menu.
4. The scene always exits by transitioning to another scene, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

This implementation should resolve the issues raised in the QA/testing phase while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

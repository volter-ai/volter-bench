## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Handle ties in speed randomly during the resolution phase.
2. Explicitly reset creature states when leaving the scene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.
2. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the creatures' HP to their max HP, and call this method before transitioning back to the main menu.

These changes can be implemented without modifying the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include `random.random()` as a tiebreaker when speeds are equal:
# Excerpt ID: 05e8221a-7b9a-4baf-a6cd-bf7fcb6b4594
   ```python
   turn_queue.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] != "swap", -x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random()))
   ```
   This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, the order is determined randomly.

2. We've added a `reset_creatures` method to reset all creatures' HP to their max HP:
# Excerpt ID: ea5c96de-3422-414f-84cb-c60b26a6e7dd
   ```python
   def reset_creatures(self):
       for player in [self.player, self.opponent]:
           for creature in player.creatures:
               creature.hp = creature.max_hp
   ```

3. In the `run` method, we call `reset_creatures` before transitioning back to the main menu:
# Excerpt ID: bfb6e3fb-d411-44a4-943c-0a993fb0a419
   ```python
   def run(self):
       self.setup_battle()
       self.battle_loop()
       self.reset_creatures()
       self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
   ```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `MainGameScene` now handles speed ties randomly and explicitly resets creature states when leaving the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Implement random tie-breaking for actions with the same speed in the resolution phase.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, we'll add a 'Back' button to the initial choices and handle it appropriately.
2. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor for tie-breaking when speeds are equal.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 99485eca-0abf-464e-ab8a-7ee74ae581f7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to the Player Choice Phase. It's included in the initial choices and also in the attack and swap sub-menus. When the human player chooses 'Back' from the main menu, it returns to the MainMenuScene.

2. Random tie-breaking for actions with the same speed has been implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method. A random factor is now included in the sorting key, which will be used to break ties when speeds are equal.

These modifications maintain the integrity of the game's architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

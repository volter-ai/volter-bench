Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead of having a reset method in the Creature model, I should:
1. Move all logic to the scenes
2. Handle creature HP reset directly in the MainGameScene
3. Simply set hp = max_hp in the scene code

Here are the files that need to be modified:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self.get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills
        ]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply player skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        # Apply bot skill if still alive
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player,
                f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Changed the creature reset logic in MainGameScene to directly set hp = max_hp
3. Kept all other functionality the same

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while preserving the same gameplay behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because `Skill` is not imported in main_game_scene.py when doing isinstance checks. We need to:
- Import the Skill and Creature models from models.py into main_game_scene.py
- Keep all type checking using these imported models
- Maintain the scene architecture and engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: 0e230968-7e62-4115-b6f9-839efc6d1cde
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

            raw_damage = (attacker.active_creature.sp_attack / defender.active_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, creature_type):

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        player_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)
        bot_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.bot.creatures)
        
        if not player_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif not bot_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for Skill model: `from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill`
2. Kept all the same functionality but now with proper model imports
3. Maintained scene architecture and engine capabilities
4. No changes to model definitions required

This should fix the NameError while maintaining all architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

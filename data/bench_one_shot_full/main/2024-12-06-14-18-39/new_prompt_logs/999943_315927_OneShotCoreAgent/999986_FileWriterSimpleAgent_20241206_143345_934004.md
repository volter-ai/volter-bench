Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because MainGameScene's run() method ends without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- `self._transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `self._quit_whole_game()` to end the game

Looking at the output, we can see the battle completed successfully ("You won the battle!"), but the scene just ended. We should:
1. After battle completion, transition back to MainMenuScene to let the player play again
2. Or quit the whole game since the battle is over
3. Keep all the existing battle logic intact

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added post-battle choice between playing again or quitting
2. Added proper scene transitions using engine capabilities:
   - `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to play again
   - `self._quit_whole_game()` to end the game
3. Maintained all existing battle logic
4. Kept within engine architecture requirements
5. No changes needed to models or other components

This should fix the scene termination error while maintaining proper game flow.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

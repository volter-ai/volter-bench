Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (with type, physical/special, damage)
- Creature (with stats, type, skills collection)
- Player (with creatures collection, active creature)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json (Tackle, Fireball, Lick)
- creature.json (Bubwool, Scizard, Dumbird)
- player.json (Default Player, Basic Opponent)

3. Create scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating)
- MainGameScene (with battle logic, phases, type effectiveness)

4. Create tests:
- test_main_menu_scene.py (already exists)
- test_main_game_scene.py (new)

Let me implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines:
1. Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
2. Models reference other models directly, not by string IDs
3. Models are ordered by dependencies
4. Scenes handle all game logic
5. Scenes use transition methods properly
6. Tests use random mode to verify scene functionality
7. Scene __str__ methods show all relevant information
8. Models are created using from_prototype_id
9. Bots are created using create_bot and treated like players

The game implements all the required features:
- Turn-based creature battles
- Type effectiveness system
- Physical/Special attack system
- HP and stats
- Creature swapping
- Win/loss conditions

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

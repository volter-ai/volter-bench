Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects, but SelectThing is a choice type that wraps a Thing. Looking at the engine code, SelectThing has a `thing` property and a `label` property, but not `display_name`.

The fix is to:
- Use `isinstance()` to check the type of choice instead of checking display_name
- For SelectThing choices, use the wrapped thing
- For Button choices, use display_name as before

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method where we now use `isinstance()` to properly check the type of choice objects instead of trying to access display_name on SelectThing objects. This maintains the architecture and capabilities of the engine while fixing the error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

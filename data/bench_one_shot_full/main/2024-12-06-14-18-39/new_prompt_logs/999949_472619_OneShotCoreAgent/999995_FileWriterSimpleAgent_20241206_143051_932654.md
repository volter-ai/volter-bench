Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `.thing` on a Button object, which doesn't exist. Looking at the engine code, we can see that SelectThing is the proper choice type to use when selecting game objects like skills. The Button class is meant for simple actions without associated data.

The fix involves:
- Changing the choice creation in MainGameScene to use SelectThing instead of Button
- Using SelectThing will properly wrap the Skill objects and allow access via the .thing property
- This matches the engine's design where SelectThing is used to select game objects that inherit from AbstractThing

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c91f2633-df4b-4160-9422-3452f61cf885
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

            # Execute turn
            self.execute_turn(first, second, first_skill, second_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before transitioning
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added SelectThing import
2. Changed Button to SelectThing for skill selection
3. Simplified skill access by using .thing property directly
4. Made the changes for both player and opponent skill selection

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling game object selection.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

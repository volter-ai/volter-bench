Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field but it's not being initialized properly. Looking at the error and architecture:

1. The problem is that `active_creature` is defined as a required field in the Player model but:
   - It's not included in the player.json prototypes
   - It shouldn't be required on initial creation since it's meant to be set during battle initialization

The solution is to:
- Make `active_creature` an Optional field in the Player model using Optional from typing
- This matches the architecture since:
  - Models remain pure data schemas
  - We're still inheriting properly from AbstractPlayer
  - The actual setting of active_creature happens in the scene logic
  - This is more correct since a player doesn't always have an active creature

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: dc2d9064-0255-44d3-8672-cb55a1697757
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The key change is making active_creature optional with a None default value. This allows the Player to be created without an active_creature, which is then set during battle initialization in MainGameScene.

This maintains the proper separation of concerns:
- Models only define the data structure
- Game logic (like setting active_creature) stays in the scenes
- We're using the engine's capabilities correctly by making fields optional when appropriate

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

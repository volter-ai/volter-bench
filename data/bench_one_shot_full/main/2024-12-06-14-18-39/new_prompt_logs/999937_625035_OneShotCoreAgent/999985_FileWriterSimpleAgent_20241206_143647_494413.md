Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
- The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase
- According to the architecture doc, when choosing "Attack" or "Swap", the player should be able to go back to the main choice
- This requires modifying MainGameScene.py to:
  - Add a "Back" button in both the attack and swap choice menus
  - Handle the back button by returning to the main choice menu
  - Keep all existing functionality intact
  - Stay within engine capabilities using Button and SelectThing

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Restructured get_player_action to use a while loop for the main choice menu
2. Added Back button to both Attack and Swap sub-menus
3. Used continue to return to main menu when Back is selected
4. Maintained all existing functionality and engine usage
5. No changes needed to models or other files

This implementation now fully matches the architecture requirements by providing the Back option in the Player Choice Phase.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

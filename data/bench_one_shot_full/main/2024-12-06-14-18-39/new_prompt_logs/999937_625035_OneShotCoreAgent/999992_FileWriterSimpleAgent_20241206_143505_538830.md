Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
- The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting
- When the battle ends, we just return from the run() method instead of calling _quit_whole_game() or _transition_to_scene()
- According to the engine architecture, scenes must explicitly end via transition or quit
- The fix is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the game when the battle concludes

2. Solution:
- Modify MainGameScene to call _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends
- This maintains proper scene lifecycle management
- Keeps the architecture clean by using engine capabilities correctly
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Changed the run() method to properly end the game with _quit_whole_game() when battle ends
2. Changed the return None in get_player_action() to continue the game loop instead of breaking it
3. Maintained all the existing functionality while ensuring proper scene lifecycle

This fix ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

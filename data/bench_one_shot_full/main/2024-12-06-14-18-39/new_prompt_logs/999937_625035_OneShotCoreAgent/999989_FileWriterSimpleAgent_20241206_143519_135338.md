Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because it's not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs when the battle ends. According to the engine architecture:

1. The test should expect and handle _QuitWholeGame as a valid end state, just like RandomModeGracefulExit
2. This maintains proper scene lifecycle where scenes must end via transition or quit
3. No changes needed to models or game logic since this is just test handling

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7344cc91-14a9-4fff-846a-dd6417242bd6
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    GracefulExit, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed normally. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected error in run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import of AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added informative print message when game ends normally
4. Maintained all other test functionality

This fix:
- Properly handles both ways a scene can end (timeout or completion)
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Doesn't modify game logic or models
- Maintains proper testing of random gameplay

The test will now pass since it recognizes game completion as a valid end state alongside random mode timeout.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

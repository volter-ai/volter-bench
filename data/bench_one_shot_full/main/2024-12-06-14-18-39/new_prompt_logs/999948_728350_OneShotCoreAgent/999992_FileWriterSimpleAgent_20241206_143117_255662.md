Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's just returning from its run method instead of explicitly transitioning to another scene or calling quit_whole_game. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always explicitly end via transition or quit.

The fix should:
1. Modify MainGameScene to properly end the game by calling quit_whole_game when the battle ends
2. Keep all the battle logic intact
3. Follow the engine's scene transition requirements
4. Maintain proper error handling

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls in all places where the scene previously just returned
2. Maintained all the game logic and functionality
3. Properly ends the game when battle is over or when no valid actions are available
4. Follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly end via transition or quit

This should resolve the test failure while maintaining the game's functionality and following the engine's architecture requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file - we need to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test, since this is the expected way the game terminates. According to the engine architecture, this is an expected exception that should be caught when testing scenes that can end the game.

Looking at the test failure:
1. The MainGameScene correctly raises _QuitWholeGame when ending
2. The test isn't catching this expected exception
3. We need to modify test_main_game_scene.py to handle both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 127d257b-8944-4f73-8f18-025ad2f45ce2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all handler to fail the test if any unexpected exceptions occur
4. Added more descriptive print messages for debugging
5. Maintained the existing RandomModeGracefulExit handler

This fix:
1. Follows the engine's architecture where _QuitWholeGame is the expected way to end the game
2. Maintains proper testing of the random run functionality
3. Provides better error reporting
4. Doesn't require any changes to the models or game logic

The test should now pass since it properly handles both ways the scene can legitimately end - either through random mode completion or through normal game completion.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

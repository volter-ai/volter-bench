Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine architecture, when a scene calls `_quit_whole_game()`, it raises a `_QuitWholeGame` exception that needs to be caught and handled appropriately.

Looking at the test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly handles both scene transitions and game quits. We should update test_main_game_scene.py to follow the same pattern:
- Add proper exception handling for `_QuitWholeGame`
- Add mocking for both quit and transition methods
- Assert that one of these methods was called

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: c63e3b2f-d410-447a-af11-c662bff86c50
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game', side_effect=AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transition triggered, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit triggered, ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene was not exited properly"

                # Reset mocks for next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()
                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This solution:
1. Properly handles all possible ways the scene can end
2. Mocks both transition and quit methods
3. Verifies the scene exits properly
4. Maintains the engine's architecture and testing patterns
5. Follows the same pattern as the working main_menu_scene test

The main changes are:
- Added proper exception handling for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
- Added mocking for both quit and transition methods
- Added assertion to verify proper scene exit
- Added mock reset between iterations

This should resolve the test failure while maintaining the engine's architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

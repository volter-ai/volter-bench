Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (either win or lose), it just breaks from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or transitioning to another scene.

According to the engine architecture, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the entire game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, after showing the win/loss message, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game session.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: d49e53a8-eae4-44a3-86a0-9d89e160835a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        if skill.skill_type == "fire":

        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
            first_creature.hp -= damage

                first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
                    
            self.execute_turn(*first)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game after victory
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game after defeat
```

The key change is replacing the `break` statements with `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

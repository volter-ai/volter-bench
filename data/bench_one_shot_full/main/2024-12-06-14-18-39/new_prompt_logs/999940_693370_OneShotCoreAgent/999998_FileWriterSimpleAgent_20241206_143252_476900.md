Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (with type, physical/special, damage)
- Creature (with stats, type, skills collection)
- Player (with creatures collection, active creature)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json (Tackle, Fireball, Lick)
- creature.json (Bubwool, Scizard, Dumbird)
- player.json (Default Player, Basic Opponent)

3. Create scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating)
- MainGameScene (with battle logic, phases, type effectiveness)

4. Create tests:
- test_main_menu_scene.py (already exists)
- test_main_game_scene.py (new)

Here's the implementation:

This implementation:
1. Creates proper data models with correct inheritance and typing
2. Uses JSON files for prototype data
3. Implements battle mechanics including:
   - Turn phases (player choice, bot choice, resolution)
   - Damage calculation with physical/special split
   - Type effectiveness
   - Speed-based turn order
   - Creature fainting and swapping
4. Includes random testing for both scenes
5. Follows all model and scene guidelines

The game can be run by executing main.py and allows players to:
1. Start a battle from the main menu
2. Choose between attacking and swapping creatures
3. Use skills with different types and damage calculations
4. Battle until one player's creatures are all fainted
5. Return to the main menu after battle

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

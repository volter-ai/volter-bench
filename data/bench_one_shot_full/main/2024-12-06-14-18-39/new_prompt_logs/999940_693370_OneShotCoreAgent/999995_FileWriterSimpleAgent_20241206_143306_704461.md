Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that is required but not being initialized in the JSON data. We need to:

1. Make `active_creature` optional in the Player model by using `Field(default=None)` since it's initialized later in the game logic
2. Keep the type hint as `Creature | None` to maintain type safety
3. Keep the model as a pure data schema without methods

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 2f208e0a-7491-4d09-b473-82e8e8583b47
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = Field(default=None)
```

This fix:
1. Uses Field(default=None) to make active_creature optional during initialization
2. Maintains type safety with Optional[Creature]
3. Keeps the model as a pure data schema
4. Follows the engine's capabilities and architecture
5. Allows the game logic to set active_creature after initialization

The validation error should now be resolved since active_creature will have a default value of None when not specified in the JSON data.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

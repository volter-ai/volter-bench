Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where player_action or bot_action can be None when executing a turn, causing the calculate_damage function to fail. This happens because:

1. When a player chooses to swap, player_action becomes a Creature instead of a Skill
2. The execute_turn function doesn't properly handle cases where actions might be None

The fix should:
1. Check for None/type of action before calculating damage
2. Handle swaps and attacks separately and clearly
3. Only calculate damage when both actions are Skills
4. Stay within the engine's architecture without modifying models

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added type hints to make the code more robust
2. Modified execute_turn to explicitly check action types
3. Only calculate damage when both actions are Skills
4. Separated swap logic from attack logic
5. Maintained the same interface and architecture

This should fix the NoneType errors while keeping the game logic intact and following the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is running the MainGameScene in random mode, but when the scene transitions back to MainMenu and eventually calls quit_whole_game(), we're not catching that exception.

The solution is to:
1. Update the test_main_game_scene.py to properly catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Add proper exception handling similar to how test_main_menu_scene.py handles it
3. Keep track of transitions to ensure the scene is properly exiting

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: b91ff8c3-0f30-4a87-a4ef-85e309017b82
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle might take more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Transitioning from MainGameScene in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "Scene did not transition properly"
                    print("Scene transitioned successfully")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added TransitionFromScene handling similar to the main menu test
3. Added proper mocking of _transition_to_scene to catch scene transitions
4. Added better logging to track what's happening in each test iteration

This maintains all the architectural requirements while properly testing the scene's behavior. The test now properly handles all possible ways the scene can end: transition, random mode exit, or game quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

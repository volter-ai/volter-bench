Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (with skill_type, base_damage)
- Creature (with creature_type, hp, max_hp, attack, defense, speed, skills)
- Player (with creatures collection)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json (with Tackle, Fireball, Lick prototypes)
- creature.json (with Bubwool and Scizard prototypes) 
- player.json (with Default Player and Basic Opponent prototypes)

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene)
- MainGameScene (with battle logic phases)

4. Create tests for both scenes using random mode testing

Key considerations:
- Models must be defined in dependency order (Skill -> Creature -> Player)
- Use proper typing and avoid forward references
- Scene strings must show all relevant game state
- Battle logic needs to handle speed ties and type effectiveness properly
- Use _wait_for_choice and _show_text for both human and bot players

Here's the implementation:

This implementation follows all the guidelines and creates a complete creature battler game with:
- Proper model inheritance and dependencies
- JSON prototype data
- Battle mechanics with type effectiveness
- Scene transitions
- Random testing
- Bot and human player support
- Complete game loop from menu to battle and back

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

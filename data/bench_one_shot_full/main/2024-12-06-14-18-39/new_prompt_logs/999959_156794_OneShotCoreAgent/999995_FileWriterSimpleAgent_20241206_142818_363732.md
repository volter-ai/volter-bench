Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're getting a dict instead of a Skill object for the opponent's skill choice. This is happening because we're using `.value` on the DictionaryChoice when getting the opponent's skill choice, which returns the dict value instead of the actual Skill object.

The fix is to handle the opponent's choice the same way we handle the player's choice - by getting the index of the selected choice and using it to get the corresponding skill from the creature's skills list.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are in the opponent choice phase where we now:
1. Create skill choices for the opponent the same way we do for the player
2. Get the opponent's choice using `_wait_for_choice`
3. Use the index of the choice to get the actual Skill object from the opponent's creature's skills list

This ensures we're working with Skill objects throughout the battle logic rather than dictionaries.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

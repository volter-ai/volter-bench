Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead of having a reset method in the Creature model, we should:
1. Move all creature state management to the MainGameScene
2. Create a helper method in MainGameScene to reset creatures
3. Keep Creature as a pure data model with just attributes

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 1f31ecd5-b2bf-41c3-8a7b-b8b5cfff9bb9
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

And the corresponding change needed in main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: 71241b51-ad93-4627-84e5-160dcefbd893
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Added _reset_creature() helper method to MainGameScene
3. Updated the scene to use _reset_creature() instead of calling reset() on the creature directly

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while keeping the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to use Player objects (which inherit from AbstractThing) as dictionary keys in self.queued_skills. The engine specifically prevents using AbstractThing objects as hashable keys, requiring us to use their prototype_ids instead.

Solution:
- Instead of storing Player objects as keys in queued_skills, we'll store their uid values
- This follows the engine's design where Thing objects shouldn't be used as keys
- We'll keep the game logic in the scene while using proper ID references

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: e3adac10-030a-49cb-9863-cfa7f7b2f340
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will store uid -> skill mappings

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle begins between {self.player.display_name} and {self.opponent.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = player_skill

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing

                defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
                
                skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]
                damage = self.calculate_damage(skill, attacker_creature, defender_creature)
                
                defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player,

                if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                    winner = attacker
                    self._show_text(self.player, 
                        f"{winner.display_name} wins! {defender_creature.display_name} was defeated!")

                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed self.queued_skills to use player.uid as keys instead of player objects
2. Updated all dictionary access to use uid instead of player object
3. Kept all other game logic the same

This maintains the engine's requirements while preserving the game's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

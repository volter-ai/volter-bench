Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since `active_creature` is marked as optional (Creature | None), we need to properly mark it as a Field with a default value of None in the models.py file.

The fix is to modify the Player class in models.py to explicitly declare active_creature as a Field with default=None. This follows the engine's pattern for optional fields while maintaining the pure data schema requirement.

Here's the complete fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 87ec0e2f-907f-4a06-ac77-83031e698937
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

This fix:
1. Maintains the pure data schema requirement
2. Properly handles the optional active_creature field using Field(default=None)
3. Keeps the type hint for proper type checking
4. Follows the engine's pattern for optional fields
5. Doesn't require changes to the JSON files since the field now has a proper default value

The validation error should now be resolved since the field is properly marked as optional with a default value.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

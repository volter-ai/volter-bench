Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `player_action` and `bot_action` in the execute_attack method, but these variables are only available in the run method's scope. This is a scope issue that we need to fix by properly passing the actions through the methods.

The fix will:
- Pass the actions as parameters through the resolve_turn and execute_attack methods
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Stay within the engine's capabilities
- Maintain proper separation of concerns

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

```

The key changes are:
1. In resolve_turn, we now properly pass the actions to execute_attack
2. Modified execute_attack to take the action as a parameter
3. Fixed the action handling in resolve_turn to properly match first/second players with their actions
4. Kept all the models and engine integration the same
5. Maintained the same game logic and flow

This should resolve the NameError issues while keeping the architecture clean and following all guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

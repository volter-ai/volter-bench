Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply assign max_hp to hp directly in the scene when needed

This follows the architecture principle that all game logic should be in scenes, while models should only define data structure.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Changed the creature reset logic in MainGameScene to directly set hp = max_hp
3. Kept all other functionality the same

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while preserving the same game behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine architecture, when a scene calls `_quit_whole_game()`, it raises a `_QuitWholeGame` exception that needs to be caught and handled appropriately.

Looking at the test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see the correct pattern - we need to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `GracefulExit` (which is the parent class of `_QuitWholeGame`).

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 338c02a8-2cf1-4bdf-ad5a-ab6e99d48e3d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except GracefulExit:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `GracefulExit`
2. Added an exception handler for `GracefulExit` in the try-except block

This matches the engine's architecture where:
- `RandomModeGracefulExit` is raised when the random mode counter hits 0
- `GracefulExit` (parent class of `_QuitWholeGame`) is raised when the game quits gracefully

Now the test will properly handle both ways the scene can end - either through random mode timeout or through normal game completion.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

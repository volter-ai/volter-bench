Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - when the battle ends, it just returns from the run method instead of explicitly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the error message and engine requirements, we need to either:
- Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends
- Or transition to another scene like MainMenuScene

The best solution is to call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends since this is a complete game session. This matches the game flow where winning or losing should end the game.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when check_battle_end() returns True. This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning from the run method.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
- Remove the reset() method from Creature model
- Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene
- Instead of calling creature.reset(), we'll set hp = max_hp directly in the scene

This follows the architecture where:
- Models only define data structure
- All logic lives in scenes
- Models remain pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed files:

# Excerpt ID: 2261b81e-f909-46ec-bf24-4d898aeb5a34
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"

    max_hp: int

    creatures: List[Creature]
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= self.player_creature.skills[0].damage

            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp  # Reset HP
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= self.bot_creature.skills[0].damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp  # Reset HP
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Replaced creature.reset() calls with direct hp assignment in MainGameScene
3. Models are now pure data schemas with no methods

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while providing the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

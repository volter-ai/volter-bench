Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because in `determine_order()` we're returning tuples of (player, creature, skill), but in `resolve_turn()` we're trying to access `second.creature`. The issue is with how we're structuring the turn resolution data.

To fix this while staying within the engine's capabilities:
- Create a proper turn resolution flow that uses the data directly
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Maintain the same game logic but restructure how we handle the turn order and skill execution

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 252cc5cd-a1d8-4941-9c20-17616bfcb602
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing, Button
import random

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_chosen_skill = None
        self.bot_chosen_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            self.player_chosen_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices).thing

            # Bot choice phase
            self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot is choosing...")
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            self.bot_chosen_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, skill_choices).thing

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

                break
            elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def resolve_turn(self):
        # Determine who goes first based on speed
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.bot_creature.speed:
            self.execute_attack(self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_chosen_skill, 
                              self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_attack(self.bot, self.bot_creature, self.bot_chosen_skill,
                                  self.player, self.player_creature)
        elif self.bot_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            self.execute_attack(self.bot, self.bot_creature, self.bot_chosen_skill,
                              self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_attack(self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_chosen_skill,
                                  self.bot, self.bot_creature)
        else:
            # Random order if speeds are equal
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                self.execute_attack(self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_chosen_skill,
                                  self.bot, self.bot_creature)
                if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_attack(self.bot, self.bot_creature, self.bot_chosen_skill,
                                      self.player, self.player_creature)
            else:
                self.execute_attack(self.bot, self.bot_creature, self.bot_chosen_skill,
                                  self.player, self.player_creature)
                if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_attack(self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_chosen_skill,
                                      self.bot, self.bot_creature)

    def execute_attack(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp -= max(0, damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the tuple-based approach in favor of direct parameter passing
2. Simplified the turn resolution logic to work directly with the model objects
3. Maintained the same game rules but with clearer execution flow
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas by not adding any methods to them
5. Preserved the engine's architecture and capabilities

This should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the game's functionality and architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` in the scene

This maintains separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while achieving the same functionality.

2. Here's the corrected models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 7581f34e-b0cf-4af0-8c79-5230383d0e12
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

The MainGameScene's end section should already handle resetting HP directly:

# Excerpt ID: 1f736e99-4ebf-4c40-8f3c-f3ff3b2e9691
```python
# Reset creatures before leaving
self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This maintains pure data models while keeping all logic in the scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

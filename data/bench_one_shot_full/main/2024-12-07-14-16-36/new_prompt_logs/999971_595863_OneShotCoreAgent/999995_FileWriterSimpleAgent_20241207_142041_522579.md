Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's architecture, a scene must always either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the player wins or loses, show the result message
2. Then transition back to MainMenuScene to allow playing again
3. This maintains the proper scene lifecycle required by the engine

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            battle_ended = self.execute_turn(first[0], second[0], first[1], second[1])
            
            if battle_ended:
                if (is_player_first and second[0].hp <= 0) or (not is_player_first and first[0].hp <= 0):
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                    
                # Always return to main menu after battle ends
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Modified execute_turn to return whether the battle ended
2. Added proper tracking of which creature belongs to the player
3. Added proper transition back to MainMenuScene when battle ends
4. Removed the break statements that were causing the scene to end improperly
5. Maintained all the existing battle mechanics while fixing the scene lifecycle

This maintains the engine's architecture requirements while keeping the game logic intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

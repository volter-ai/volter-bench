Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test should catch this exception since it's an expected way for the game to end. Additionally, we should verify that either a scene transition occurred or the game quit gracefully.

The test needs to follow the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py, where we:
1. Mock the transition and quit methods
2. Catch all expected exceptions (RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame)
3. Verify that the scene ended in an expected way

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: cc5f934c-c823-4687-951b-cc3b30fee5bd
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch the two ways of exiting the scene
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
2. Added proper mocking of scene transitions
3. Added verification that scene exits properly
4. Added proper cleanup between test iterations
5. Maintained the same test structure as test_main_menu_scene.py

This maintains consistency with the engine's architecture and testing patterns while properly handling all ways the scene can end.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

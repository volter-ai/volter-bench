Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's get_player_action when handling the "Back" button during swap choices. The code tries to access `thing` on a Button object, which doesn't exist.

The issue is in the logic flow:
- When handling swap choices, we append a "Back" Button to available_creatures
- When the player chooses "Back", we get a Button object
- The code tries to access .thing on this Button object, which fails

The solution:
- We need to check if the swap_choice is a Button before trying to access .thing
- If it's a Button, we continue the loop
- Only if it's a SelectThing do we return with the creature
- This maintains the engine's architecture and doesn't require model changes

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are in the get_player_action method:
1. Changed `if skill_choice == "Back"` to `if isinstance(skill_choice, Button)`
2. Changed `if swap_choice == "Back"` to `if isinstance(swap_choice, Button)`

This properly handles the Button vs SelectThing type checking while maintaining the engine's architecture and keeping models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

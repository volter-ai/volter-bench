Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models, which violates the "pure data schemas" requirement. The models should only contain data fields, with all logic in scenes.

To fix this:
- Remove all methods from models
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene
- Keep track of max_hp in Creature model but handle hp resets in the scene
- Handle active_creature selection in the scene rather than Player model

2. Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: f8c0cf0a-e5a0-4df6-94d4-547c16c1f17f
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature = None
```

The MainGameScene will need to handle resetting creatures when initializing the battle:

# Excerpt ID: 781469da-b8e6-43e0-8929-2d4d3b3b77ff
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures HP and set initial active creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    # Rest of the MainGameScene implementation remains the same...
```

This change:
1. Removes all methods from models, making them pure data schemas
2. Moves the reset logic to the scene initialization
3. Maintains the same functionality but in a way that follows the engine's architecture requirements

The rest of MainGameScene can remain unchanged since it already handles all other game logic appropriately.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

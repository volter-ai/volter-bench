Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene's run() method is ending without properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. When the battle ends, we need to:
- Call _quit_whole_game() when the battle is over instead of just returning
- This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit
- No changes needed to models since this is purely a scene flow issue

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the run() method where we now call self._quit_whole_game() when the battle ends instead of just returning. This properly signals the end of the game to the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

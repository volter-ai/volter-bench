Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is designed to catch either RandomModeGracefulExit or a scene transition, but when the random choices lead to quitting the game, the QuitWholeGame exception is uncaught.

The test should be modified to:
1. Catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame as a valid exit condition
2. Keep the existing catches for RandomModeGracefulExit and scene transitions
3. Consider all three as valid ways for the test to end

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 80ee9470-06bd-42fa-bf0e-c558d114e32a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch the transition method so we can catch it
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully during run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Improved the error messages to better indicate how each run ends
4. Simplified the test by removing redundant quit game patching since we now handle that exception

This maintains the architecture and engine capabilities while properly handling all valid ways the scene can end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

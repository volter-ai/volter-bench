## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The skill buttons are not visible in the UI, despite being present in the code.
2. The "Waiting for opponent's move..." message is displayed, which suggests that there are no available button slugs.
3. The image paths for players and creatures are likely incorrect, as they are not visible in the rendered image.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Modify the condition for displaying skill buttons to show them even when there are no available button slugs.
2. Update the image paths to use placeholder images or remove them if not available.
3. Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` are properly populated.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;

  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player, opponent, player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (

          <CreatureCard

          {player_creature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid) && emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
        {availableButtonSlugs.length === 0 && (
          <p className="text-lg mt-4">Waiting for opponent's move...</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Removed the condition that was hiding the skill buttons when there were no available button slugs.
2. Removed the `imageUrl` props from `PlayerCard` and `CreatureCard` components, as they were likely causing issues and are not visible in the rendered image.
3. Modified the `onClick` handler for `SkillButton` to only emit the button click if the skill's uid is in the `availableButtonSlugs` array.
4. Moved the "Waiting for opponent's move..." message to appear below the skill buttons when there are no available button slugs.

These changes should resolve the issues with the UI and make the skill buttons visible while still maintaining the correct functionality based on the available button slugs.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

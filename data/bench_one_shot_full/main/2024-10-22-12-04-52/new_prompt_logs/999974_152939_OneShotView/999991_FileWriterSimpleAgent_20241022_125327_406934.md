## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Within this container, we'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top of the screen using a large, bold text element.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a button container at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to give it a game-like feel.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.

8. Interactivity:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function from useCurrentButtons to handle button clicks.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `flex flex-col` for the main container to arrange items vertically.
- `justify-between` will be used to push the title to the top and buttons to the bottom.
- `items-center` will center items horizontally.
- We'll use `w-full h-full` for full width and height, and `max-w-[177.78vh] max-h-[56.25vw]` to maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio.
- `text-4xl font-bold` will be used for the title text.
- For buttons, we'll use `px-4 py-2 rounded` for padding and rounded corners, and `hover:bg-opacity-80` for a hover effect.

Now, let's implement the component:

# Excerpt ID: 568228bc-761d-48bd-a73a-5a93860190e6
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
    };
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || 'Player';

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full h-full max-w-[177.78vh] max-h-[56.25vw] flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-8">
          Creature Battle Game
        </h1>

        <div className="text-xl text-white">
          Welcome, {playerName}!
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-8">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 bg-green-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-80 transition-colors"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Play Game
            </button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 bg-red-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-opacity-80 transition-colors"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Quit Game
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene that adheres to the 16:9 aspect ratio and fills the available space. It displays a title at the top, a welcome message in the middle, and buttons at the bottom. The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes error handling for missing data. The buttons are only rendered if they are available in the current game state.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

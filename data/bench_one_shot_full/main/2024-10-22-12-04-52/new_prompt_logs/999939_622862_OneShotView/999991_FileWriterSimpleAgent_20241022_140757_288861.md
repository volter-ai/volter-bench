## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two sections: the top section for the game title and the bottom section for the buttons.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title using a large, bold text at the top of the screen.

4. Buttons:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from the useCurrentButtons hook to dynamically render and handle button clicks. We'll create buttons for "Play" and "Quit" if they're available.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to give it a game-like appearance.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `flex` and `flex-col` for the main layout.
- `items-center` and `justify-center` will be used to center content vertically and horizontally.
- `w-full` and `h-screen` will make the component take up the full width and height of the screen.
- We'll use `max-w-[177.78vh]` and `max-h-[56.25vw]` to maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio.
- `text-4xl` or `text-5xl` will be used for the game title to make it prominent.
- `mt-auto` will be used to push the buttons to the bottom of the screen.
- We'll use `bg-gradient-to-b` for a gradient background effect.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 7c48bd18-2ce7-4d55-864f-22286a7346c6
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
    };
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full h-full max-w-[177.78vh] max-h-[56.25vw] flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Creature Battle Game</h1>
        
        <div className="text-2xl text-white mb-8">
          Welcome, {playerName}!
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center mb-16 space-y-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold rounded-full transition duration-200"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Play
            </button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold rounded-full transition duration-200"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a prominent game title at the top, a welcome message, and buttons for "Play" and "Quit" at the bottom. The layout maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio and is centered on the screen. The buttons are only rendered if they're available in the `availableButtonSlugs` array, and they use icons from Lucide React for better visual appeal.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

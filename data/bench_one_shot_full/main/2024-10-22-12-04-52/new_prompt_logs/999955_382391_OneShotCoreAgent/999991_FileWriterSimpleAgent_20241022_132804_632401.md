## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the skill execution order in the MainGameScene.

1. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `resolve_turn` method in the MainGameScene class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use a random decision in that case. Here's how we'll do it:

   - We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - We'll then execute the skills in the order determined by either the speed comparison or the random choice.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture described in the documentation.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8b83f78e-d113-4773-92a0-3bb2cbc16beb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn:

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

            return True

```

This implementation now correctly handles the case of equal speed by deciding randomly which creature goes first, as specified in the architecture document. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining consistency with the existing implementation and adhering to the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

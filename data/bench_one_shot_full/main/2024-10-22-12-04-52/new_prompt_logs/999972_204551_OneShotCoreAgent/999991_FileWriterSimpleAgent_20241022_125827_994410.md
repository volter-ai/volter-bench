## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problems and provide a solution that aligns with the architecture documents and the engine's capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:
   - I'll implement the speed comparison and random tie-breaking for skill execution in the MainGameScene.
   - I'll remove the max_turns attribute and related logic, as it's not described in the architecture.
   - I'll ensure that the turn order is determined by the creatures' speed stats, with random tie-breaking when speeds are equal.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1bdf6151-e523-44b4-91ec-c5ece839d3e8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):

            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. It implements speed comparison and random tie-breaking for skill execution in the `_resolve_turn` method.
2. The `max_turns` attribute and related logic have been removed.
3. The turn order is now determined by the creatures' speed stats, with random tie-breaking when speeds are equal.

The rest of the implementation remains consistent with the architecture documents and the engine's capabilities. The models are still pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

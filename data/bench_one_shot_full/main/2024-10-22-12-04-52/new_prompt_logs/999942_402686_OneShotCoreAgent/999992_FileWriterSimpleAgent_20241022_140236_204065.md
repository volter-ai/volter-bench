## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no valid creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll add a check to ensure there are valid creatures to swap to before offering choices.
2. If there are no valid swap choices, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. In the `get_player_action` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None` by defaulting to the "Attack" action.

Here's the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that we don't call `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list of choices. If there are no valid creatures to swap to, we default to the "Attack" action. This should resolve the AssertionError and allow the game to continue running even when a player has no valid swap options.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that may be causing the timeout error:

1. The battlefield is not properly sized, taking up most of the screen and pushing the user interface area off-screen.
2. The creature cards are not displaying the correct information or styling.
3. The user interface area is not visible, which means the buttons for skills are not accessible.
4. The "Your turn!" message is misplaced and not part of the main layout.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Adjust the layout to ensure all elements are visible on the screen.
2. Correct the CreatureCard component usage to display proper information.
3. Ensure the user interface area is visible and properly sized.
4. Integrate the turn indicator into the main layout.

Here's the implemented solution:

# Excerpt ID: c4a692ad-a9a2-42eb-8b4f-3e886bcc6a36
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <Shield className="mr-2" />
          <span>Player</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <span>Opponent</span>
          <Swords className="ml-2" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-1 flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <CreatureCard
          uid={playerCreature.uid}
          name={playerCreature.display_name}
          imageUrl="/path/to/player-creature-image.jpg"
          hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
          maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
        />
        <CreatureCard
          uid={botCreature.uid}
          name={botCreature.display_name}
          imageUrl="/path/to/bot-creature-image.jpg"
          hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
          maxHp={botCreature.stats.max_hp}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        <div className="mb-2 text-center font-bold">Your turn!</div>
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 justify-center">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
              const skill = playerCreature.collections.skills.find(skill => skill.uid === slug);
              return skill ? (
                <SkillButton
                  key={slug}
                  uid={slug}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              ) : null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-lg text-center">
            Game text will be displayed here when no buttons are available.
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Adjusted the layout to ensure all elements are visible by setting appropriate flex and height classes.
2. Updated the CreatureCard component usage to include maxHp and removed null checks as we assume the data is always present.
3. Added overflow-y-auto to the user interface area to ensure it's scrollable if content exceeds the height.
4. Integrated the "Your turn!" message into the user interface area.
5. Centered the skill buttons and game text for better visibility.
6. Added a null check when mapping over skills to prevent errors if a skill is not found.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure all elements are visible and functional, potentially fixing the timeout error by allowing the UI to render completely.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

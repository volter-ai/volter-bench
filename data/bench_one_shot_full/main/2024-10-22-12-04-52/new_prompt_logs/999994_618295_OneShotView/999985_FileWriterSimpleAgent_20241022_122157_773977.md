## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **User Interface Overlap**: The text "Game text will be displayed here when no buttons are available." is visible, but it seems to be overlapping with the area where buttons should appear. This suggests that the buttons are not being rendered or are hidden.

2. **Button Visibility**: The buttons representing the player's available skills are not visible, which might be due to incorrect logic in rendering them or a CSS issue causing them to be hidden.

3. **Layout Issues**: The layout seems to be correct in terms of the battlefield and HUD, but the user interface area might not be switching correctly between text and buttons.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Button Rendering Logic**: Ensure that the logic for rendering buttons is correct and that the `availableButtonSlugs` array is being populated correctly.

2. **CSS Adjustments**: Make sure that the CSS for the user interface area allows for dynamic content switching between text and buttons without overlap.

3. **Debugging the Button Logic**: Verify that the `emitButtonClick` function is correctly set up to handle button clicks and that the `availableButtonSlugs` are being correctly mapped to the player's skills.

### Code Implementation

# Excerpt ID: 4ade5505-4a5d-4b60-854c-970e4ed38030
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <Shield className="mr-2" />
          <span>Player</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <span>Opponent</span>
          <Swords className="ml-2" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-1 flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <CreatureCard
          uid={playerCreature?.uid ?? "player-creature"}
          name={playerCreature?.display_name ?? "Player Creature"}
          imageUrl="/path/to/player-creature-image.jpg"
          hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
        />
        <CreatureCard
          uid={botCreature?.uid ?? "bot-creature"}
          name={botCreature?.display_name ?? "Opponent Creature"}
          imageUrl="/path/to/bot-creature-image.jpg"
          hp={botCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
              const skill = playerCreature?.collections.skills.find(skill => skill.uid === slug);
              return (
                <SkillButton
                  key={slug}
                  uid={slug}
                  skillName={skill?.display_name ?? ""}
                  description={skill?.description ?? ""}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill?.stats.damage ?? 0}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              );
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-lg">
            Game text will be displayed here when no buttons are available.
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Button Rendering Logic**: The code now ensures that each button is correctly mapped to a skill using `find` on the player's skills. This ensures that the correct skill information is displayed.

- **CSS Adjustments**: The CSS remains the same, but ensure that the `flex-wrap` and `gap` properties are correctly applied to allow buttons to display without overlap.

- **Debugging**: Ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is correctly populated and that `emitButtonClick` is only called with valid slugs.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

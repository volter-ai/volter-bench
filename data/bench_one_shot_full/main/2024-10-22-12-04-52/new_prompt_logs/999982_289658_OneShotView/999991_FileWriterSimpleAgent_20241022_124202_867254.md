## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and following the guidelines more closely.

# Excerpt ID: 69946d67-e146-43e4-ac60-92f973eb58bc
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data, uid }: { data: GameUIData; uid: string }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderButtons = () => {
    return (
      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <button
            className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <button
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
      <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
          {data?.display_name ?? "Game Title"}
        </h1>
        <div className="flex-grow" />
        {renderButtons()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This corrected version includes the following changes:

1. Added the `uid` prop to the component's props interface.
2. Used the elvis operator (`?.`) and nullish coalescing operator (`??`) for safer property access on `data.display_name`.
3. Kept the existing imports and named exports as requested.
4. Maintained the use of inline Tailwind styles for creating the described view.
5. Ensured that the game takes up the entire 16:9 game container while fitting into the window.
6. Kept the implementation of button rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`.

These changes address the issues mentioned in the previous review while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the component. The code now follows the guidelines more closely and should be safer to use with potentially undefined data.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

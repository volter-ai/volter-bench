## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the necessary changes.

1. How to fix the issues:

a) Adding 'Back' option in the player choice phase:
   - We'll add a 'Back' button in the attack and swap choice menus.
   - When 'Back' is selected, we'll return to the main choice menu (Attack/Swap).

b) Handling speed ties randomly in the resolution phase:
   - We'll modify the sorting of actions to use a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

c) Resetting the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene:
   - We'll add a method to reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp.
   - We'll call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choice menus.
2. Speed ties are now resolved randomly using `random.random()` as a tiebreaker.
3. A `reset_creatures` method has been added and is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, resetting all creatures' HP to their maximum values.

The implementation now fully adheres to the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

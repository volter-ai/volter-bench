## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game when the battle ends. Currently, the scene is terminating without calling either of these methods, which is causing the test failures.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `run` method to include a game loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends (when `check_battle_end` returns True), we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
3. We'll also add a small delay after showing the battle result to ensure the players can see the outcome before transitioning.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 092f705f-6c61-4e6b-accf-5d74a1207dbc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends. The added `time.sleep(2)` gives players a moment to see the battle result before the transition occurs. This should resolve the test failures and make the game flow as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the run method doesn't terminate without calling a transition or quit method.
3. We'll add a loop in the run method to allow for multiple battles if desired.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 485c0540-7ca5-4e43-8864-86e335968d88
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.opponent_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
            battle_result = self._run_battle()
            
            if battle_result == "win":
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

            self._reset_creatures()

            play_again = self._ask_play_again()
            if not play_again:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _run_battle(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                    return "lose"
                elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                    return "win"

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You received {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def _ask_play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        main_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, main_menu_button])
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This revised implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a main loop in the `run` method that allows for multiple battles.
2. Properly handling the end of each battle and asking the player if they want to play again.
3. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the player chooses not to play again.
4. Ensuring that the scene always exits through either a transition or by quitting the game.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene behaves correctly within the game's architecture and the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

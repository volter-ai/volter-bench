Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 17375e3e-ad03-476b-be46-dd2231c74fef
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And here's the modified section in main_game_scene.py where we handle resetting HP (only showing the relevant part that needs to change):

# Excerpt ID: 4674c144-1096-43de-9846-4b960bab94c3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
                if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                    defender_creature.hp = 0
                    winner = attacker
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                    # Reset HP directly instead of using a method
                    self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                    self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into the scene
3. Kept models as pure data schemas

This maintains separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while preserving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

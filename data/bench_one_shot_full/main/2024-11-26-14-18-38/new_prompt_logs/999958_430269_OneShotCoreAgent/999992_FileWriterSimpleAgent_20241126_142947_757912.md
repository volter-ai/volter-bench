Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows a syntax error with "return outside function" in main_game_scene.py. Looking at the code, there must be a return statement at the class level instead of inside a method. This is a basic Python syntax error that needs to be fixed.

The solution is to:
1. Review main_game_scene.py
2. Ensure all return statements are properly inside class methods
3. Keep all game logic in the scene while maintaining models as pure data schemas
4. Keep all type references direct in the models

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: c11c1d94-db3b-43eb-8962-1060043cfca0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.bot, self.bot_creature, bot_skill)
            )

            # Execute skills in order
            for attacker, attacker_creature, skill in [first, second]:
                defender_creature = self.bot_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
                damage = self._calculate_damage(skill, attacker_creature, defender_creature)
                defender_creature.hp -= damage
                
                self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
                
                if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                    defender_creature.hp = 0
                    winner = attacker
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                    self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                    self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, player_data, bot_data):
        player, player_creature, _ = player_data
        bot, bot_creature, _ = bot_data
        
        if player_creature.speed > bot_creature.speed:
            return player_data, bot_data
        elif bot_creature.speed > player_creature.speed:
            return bot_data, player_data
        else:
            return random.sample([player_data, bot_data], 2)

    def _calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self._get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def _get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed any return statements that were outside of methods
2. Kept all game logic within proper class methods
3. Maintained the scene's functionality while fixing the syntax error
4. Preserved the architecture where scenes handle logic and models remain pure data schemas

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

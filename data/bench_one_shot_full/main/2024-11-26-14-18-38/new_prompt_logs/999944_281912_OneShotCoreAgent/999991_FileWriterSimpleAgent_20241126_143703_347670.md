Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
Looking at the architecture docs, specifically main_game_scene.md, it states: "When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

Currently, we initialize creature HP at the start of the scene but don't reset when leaving. Since models must be pure data schemas, we can't add reset methods there. Instead, we should reset the creatures' HP in the MainGameScene just before calling `_quit_whole_game()`.

The fix is simple: we'll add a helper method in MainGameScene to reset creatures and call it before quitting. This keeps models as pure data schemas while ensuring creatures are reset when leaving the scene.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 3c847ed9-181f-4215-aa25-234166554bad

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `_reset_creatures()` method to handle resetting creature state
2. Called `_reset_creatures()` before `_quit_whole_game()` in the run method
3. The reset logic restores both HP and active creature selection to initial state

This maintains the pure data schema nature of the models while properly implementing the architecture requirement to reset creature state when leaving the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

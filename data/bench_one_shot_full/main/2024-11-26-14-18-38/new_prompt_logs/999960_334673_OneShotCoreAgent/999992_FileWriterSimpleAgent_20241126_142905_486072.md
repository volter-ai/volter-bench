Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The error shows that `MainGameScene` cannot be imported, which suggests there's an issue with how the class is defined in main_game_scene.py. Looking at the engine's lib.py, I notice that MainGameScene needs to properly inherit from AbstractGameScene and specify its player type.

The fix involves:
1. Making MainGameScene properly inherit from AbstractGameScene with the correct type parameter
2. Ensuring all imports are correct
3. Following the same pattern as MainMenuScene which works

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: a633d503-6ec5-490a-a00b-410987985a79
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing, Button
from main_game.models import Player
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene[Player]):
    def __init__(self, app, player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

    def run(self):
        while True:

            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])

            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender = self.opponent
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender = self.player
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
            f"Dealt {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper type parameter to AbstractGameScene[Player]
2. Added explicit type hint for player parameter in __init__
3. Added import for Player model
4. Kept all the scene logic within the scene class
5. Maintained the same structure for handling game state and transitions

This should resolve the import error while maintaining the engine's architecture requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: fd7b3c90-ff81-4eaf-9dc7-0936d8cd494d
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And the relevant part of MainGameScene needs to be updated to:

# Excerpt ID: 7b4d16d6-c7d8-4955-af29-fab1a3263965
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill.thing),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill.thing)
            )

            # Execute skills in order
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._execute_skill(*second)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This maintains the same functionality but keeps the models as pure data schemas, following the engine's architecture requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

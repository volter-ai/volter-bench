Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it needs to either transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Currently it just returns from the run() method, which is an antipattern according to the engine.

Looking at the error:
1. The scene terminates without calling quit_whole_game or transition_to_scene
2. The test fails because neither mock (transition or quit) was called

The fix is simple - in MainGameScene, when check_battle_end() returns True (meaning the battle is over), we should call _quit_whole_game() to properly end the game. This follows the engine's pattern of explicitly ending scenes rather than just returning.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            winner = "You win!" if p_alive else "You lose!"
            self._show_text(self.player, winner)
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now call self._quit_whole_game() when check_battle_end() returns True. This ensures we properly terminate the scene through the engine's mechanisms rather than just letting it end implicitly.

This follows the engine's architecture by:
1. Using proper scene termination methods
2. Maintaining the scene lifecycle
3. Properly signaling game end
4. Following the engine's pattern of explicit scene transitions/termination

The fix should resolve both test failures since:
1. The scene will now properly call _quit_whole_game when ending
2. The test mocks will detect this call and pass their assertions

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

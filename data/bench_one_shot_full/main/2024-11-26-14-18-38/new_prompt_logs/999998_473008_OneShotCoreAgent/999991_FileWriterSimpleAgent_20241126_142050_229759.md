Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me describe the fix:

1. The issue is that we need to reset creature HP when transitioning out of MainGameScene
2. Since models can't have methods, we need to handle this in the scene
3. We'll reset both player and bot creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning
4. This should happen regardless of win/lose condition

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 6e25ab03-087b-4b44-9824-84ad6c8eef73
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot choice phase  
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.player_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        """Reset all creatures to their max HP before transitioning"""
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `_reset_creatures()` method to handle resetting HP
2. Called `_reset_creatures()` before each transition
3. This ensures creatures are reset to full HP before leaving the scene
4. The reset happens in the scene logic, not in the models, maintaining the pure data schema requirement

This implementation now properly follows the architecture requirement to reset creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't properly exit using either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without transitioning anywhere.

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to:
1. After a battle ends (win or lose), transition back to MainMenuScene
2. Use `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()` instead of just breaking the loop

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a80a7b5b-18f8-40b7-827d-8213fe2e9949
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot choice phase  
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.player_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end()` method and integrated the win/lose conditions directly in the main loop
2. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after showing win/lose messages
3. Removed the `break` statement and let the transition handle exiting the scene properly

This ensures the scene always exits through proper engine mechanisms rather than just breaking the loop. The scene will now properly transition back to the main menu after a battle ends, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

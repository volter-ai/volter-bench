## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for overlooking this detail in the architecture. Let's address this problem and implement the correct behavior for the resolution phase when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll implement a random decision-making process when the creatures have equal speed. Here's how we'll do it:

   - Check if the speeds of both creatures are equal.
   - If they are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - Implement the skill execution based on this random selection.
   - Keep the existing logic for cases where speeds are not equal.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2daeb891-5be8-4373-8ce9-3eca45c7a1f7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):

                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Both creatures have equal speed! {first_attacker.display_name}'s {first_creature.display_name} attacks first!")

            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted!")
            return "player_lose"
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted!")
            return "player_win"
        return None
```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing a random decision-making process when the creatures have equal speed. The `resolution_phase` method now handles three cases:

1. Player's creature is faster
2. Opponent's creature is faster
3. Both creatures have equal speed

In the case of equal speed, we use `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature attacks first, fulfilling the requirement specified in the architecture. We also added a message to inform the player when this situation occurs.

This implementation should now fully meet the specified requirements and align with the architecture documents.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

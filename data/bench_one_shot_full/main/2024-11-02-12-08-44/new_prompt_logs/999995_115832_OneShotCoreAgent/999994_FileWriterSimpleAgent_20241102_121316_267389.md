## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` in the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, whether the player wins or loses.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 485dbc48-e411-4b29-8168-73cd9257f364
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            if player_skill is None:
                return

            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                return

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == quit_button:
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return None

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This solution adds the `_reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. It's called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene (in case of win or loss) and before quitting the game. This ensures that the creatures' state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene, as required by the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

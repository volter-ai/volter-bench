## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these discrepancies, I'll make the following changes:

1. Add a "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase for both "Attack" and "Swap" choices.
2. Implement a method to reset creature states when leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `player_turn` method, I'll add a "Back" option when choosing between "Attack" and "Swap", and also when selecting a skill or a creature to swap.
2. I'll create a new method called `reset_creature_states` that will be called when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. A "Back" option has been added to the Player Choice Phase, allowing the player to go back to the main choice or cancel their action.
2. A `reset_creature_states` method has been implemented and is called when leaving the scene (transitioning back to the MainMenuScene). This method restores all creatures to full health for both the player and the opponent.

These modifications should bring the implementation in line with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test needs to catch this exception since it's an expected part of the game flow when quitting.

The test is also not properly handling scene transitions. We should patch the transition methods in MainGameScene test just like we do in MainMenuScene test to prevent infinite recursion between scenes.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d0758b1f-ece1-4df5-bd6c-a95d023ce1c0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transition detected. Ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit detected. Ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("Game quit detected")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("Scene transition detected")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:

1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added patching for both transition and quit methods in MainGameScene, similar to MainMenuScene test
3. Added TransitionFromScene exception to catch and handle scene transitions
4. Added proper cleanup in finally block

This solution:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Doesn't modify any models
- Properly tests the game flow
- Prevents infinite recursion between scenes
- Handles all expected exceptions

The test will now properly handle all possible ways the game can end during random testing:
- Scene transitions
- Random mode timeout
- Game quit
- Battle completion

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

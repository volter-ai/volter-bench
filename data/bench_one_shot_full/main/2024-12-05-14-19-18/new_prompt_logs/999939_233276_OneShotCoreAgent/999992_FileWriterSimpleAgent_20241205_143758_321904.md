Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's just returning from the run() method instead of calling _quit_whole_game() or _transition_to_scene(). According to the error message, this is an antipattern.

The fix needs to:
1. Ensure the scene properly ends by calling _quit_whole_game() when the battle is over
2. Never return directly from run()
3. Keep the game loop running until an explicit scene transition or game end

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Changed the run() method to never return directly - instead it calls _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends
2. Changed get_player_action() to return None and continue the loop if no valid action is available
3. Added feedback messages for swapping creatures
4. Improved error handling for when no creatures are available to swap

This maintains the architecture while properly ending the scene through the engine's mechanisms rather than returning directly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

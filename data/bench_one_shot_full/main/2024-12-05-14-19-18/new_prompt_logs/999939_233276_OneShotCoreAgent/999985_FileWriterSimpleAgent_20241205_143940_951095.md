Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
- The error occurs because we're trying to use Creature objects as dictionary keys in initial_states
- According to the error message and guidelines, we should use prototype_id instead of the object itself
- We need to modify MainGameScene to store creature states using prototype_ids as keys
- This maintains the architecture where:
  - Models remain pure data schemas
  - We use prototype_ids for identification/keys
  - Game logic stays in scenes
  - We still achieve the goal of resetting creature stats

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is using prototype_ids instead of Creature objects as dictionary keys:
# Excerpt ID: 9db5e1d3-43cd-46f8-bf24-06d04cd1c901
```python
# Before (error):
self.initial_states[creature] = CreatureState(...)

# After (fixed):
self.initial_states[creature.prototype_id] = CreatureState(...)
```

This follows the engine's guidelines by:
1. Using prototype_ids for identification instead of the objects themselves
2. Keeping models as pure data schemas
3. Maintaining all game logic in the scene
4. Properly handling state management without modifying model classes

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

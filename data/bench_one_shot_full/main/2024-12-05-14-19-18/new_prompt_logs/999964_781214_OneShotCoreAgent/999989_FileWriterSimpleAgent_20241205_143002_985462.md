Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine architecture, when testing scenes in random mode:

- We should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves are exhausted) and _QuitWholeGame (when the game quits)
- Both are valid ways for a scene to end during random testing
- The test should pass in either case

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 98d0b36e-0418-464f-b617-be611be3e2a5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")

            # Reset for next iteration
            HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game quits gracefully
4. Added reset of random mode between iterations
5. Maintained the engine's architecture and testing patterns
6. No changes needed to models or other components

This should fix the test failure while properly handling both ways a random test run can end - either by exhausting random moves or by the game quitting gracefully.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is that the MainGameScene is terminating without properly calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. According to the error message and engine architecture:

- Scenes must explicitly end via one of these two methods
- Simply returning from run() is an antipattern
- When the battle ends (win or lose), we should transition back to MainMenuScene or quit the game

The fix will be to modify MainGameScene to:
1. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends
2. Never return directly from run()
3. Keep the game loop running until an explicit scene transition or quit

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        elif not opponent_has_creatures:
            return "You won!"
            
        return None
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed check_battle_end() to return the result message instead of showing it directly
2. Modified run() to:
   - Continue instead of return when actions are None
   - Call _quit_whole_game() when battle ends instead of returning
   - Never exit the while True loop except via _quit_whole_game()
3. Moved the _show_text() for battle end into run() for better flow control

This ensures the scene always ends properly according to the engine's requirements, while maintaining the same game logic and staying within the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Fix Description:
I'll fix two issues in MainGameScene:

a) Add "Back" option:
- In get_player_action(), add a "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
- When "Back" is selected, return to the main action menu (Attack/Swap)
- This matches the architecture doc's requirement for a branching choice system

b) Reset creature state:
- Override the scene's _transition_to_scene method
- Before transitioning, reset all creatures to their max_hp
- This ensures creatures are fresh for the next battle

The fix stays within engine capabilities by:
- Using Button for the "Back" option
- Using _transition_to_scene for proper scene management
- Keeping models as pure data schemas
- Only modifying creature state data, not adding methods

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        # Call parent implementation to do the actual transition
        super()._transition_to_scene(scene_name)
```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button and logic to get_player_action()
2. Changed get_player_action() to use a while True loop for menu navigation
3. Added _transition_to_scene() override to reset creature states
4. Changed battle end to use _transition_to_scene() instead of _quit_whole_game()

This implementation now fully matches the architecture documentation while maintaining the engine's patterns and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

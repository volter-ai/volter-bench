Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error occurs because `Creature` is not imported in the main_game_scene.py file. According to the architecture, models should be imported and referenced directly. The fix is simple - we need to import the Creature and Skill models from models.py into main_game_scene.py.

This follows the guidelines because:
- We're maintaining direct model references rather than using strings
- We're keeping models as pure data schemas
- We're properly using the model types for type checking

2. Here's the fixed file:

            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}

            return True
            
        return False
```

The only change needed was adding the import statement at the top:
# Excerpt ID: 9ea48fbb-09be-49f6-a6fe-9090a38542df
```python
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
```

This allows the scene to properly type check against the model classes when using isinstance().

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

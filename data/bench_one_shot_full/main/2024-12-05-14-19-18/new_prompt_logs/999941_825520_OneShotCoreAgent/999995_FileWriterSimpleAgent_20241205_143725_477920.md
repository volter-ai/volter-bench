Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's returning from the run() method without calling either _quit_whole_game() or _transition_to_scene(). This violates the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

The problem occurs in two places:
1. In check_battle_end(), we just return True/False instead of handling the scene transition
2. In the run() method, we return directly when the battle ends instead of transitioning

The fix is to:
1. Modify check_battle_end() to handle the scene transition directly
2. Remove the return from run() and let the scene transition handle ending the battle
3. Add proper scene transition back to MainMenuScene when battle ends

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(attack_type, {}).get(defend_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        p_has_active = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)
        o_has_active = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.opponent.creatures)
        
        if not p_has_active:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif not o_has_active:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

Key changes:
1. check_battle_end() now calls _transition_to_scene() directly instead of returning True/False
2. run() no longer returns when check_battle_end() is called
3. get_player_action() returns None for invalid swaps instead of recursing
4. Added proper scene transition back to MainMenuScene when battle ends

This ensures the scene always ends with a proper transition and follows the engine's requirements for scene flow control. The tests should now pass since the scene will properly transition or quit instead of returning directly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

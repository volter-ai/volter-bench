Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're using the player's skill choices for the opponent's choice selection. This is incorrect because:

1. The opponent has their own set of skills (Scizard has Tackle and Fireball, while Bubwool has Tackle and Lick)
2. We're trying to match the opponent's random choice against the player's skill list, which causes the StopIteration error

The fix is to:
1. Create separate skill choices for the opponent based on their creature's skills
2. Match the opponent's choice against their own skill list

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        while True:

            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_choices)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key changes are in the run() method:
1. Created separate player_skill_choices and opponent_skill_choices lists
2. Use opponent_skill_choices when getting opponent's choice
3. Match opponent's choice against their own creature's skills

This maintains the architecture and model guidelines while fixing the bug. The opponent now properly uses their own creature's skills for selection and matching.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

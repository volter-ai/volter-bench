Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error is occurring because f-strings in Python cannot contain backslashes. The issue is in main_game_scene.py where we're trying to use `'Foe\'s'` in an f-string. The simple fix is to use double quotes around the string containing the apostrophe instead of escaping it.

This is a purely syntactical issue and doesn't affect the architecture or models. We just need to fix the string formatting in the MainGameScene class.

2. Here's the fixed file:

```

The key changes were:
1. Removed the escaped apostrophe in the f-string expressions
2. Used string concatenation with ternary operators without escaping

The rest of the implementation remains exactly the same, maintaining all the architectural patterns and model relationships.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

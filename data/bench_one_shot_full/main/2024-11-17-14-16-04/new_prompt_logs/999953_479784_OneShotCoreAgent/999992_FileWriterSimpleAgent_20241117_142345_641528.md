Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's _resolve_turn method where we try to unpack 3 values (attacker, defender, skill) but _determine_order() only returns tuples with 2 values. The issue is in the mismatch between what _determine_order returns and what _resolve_turn expects.

The fix:
- _determine_order currently returns ((creature1, creature2), (creature2, creature1))
- We need it to return ((creature1, creature2, skill1), (creature2, creature1, skill2))
- This means we need to pass the skills into _determine_order and include them in the return tuples
- This maintains pure data models while fixing the logic in the scene

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Modified _determine_order to take player_skill and opponent_skill as parameters
2. Changed _determine_order to return 3-tuples containing (attacker, defender, skill)
3. Updated _resolve_turn to pass the skills to _determine_order
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas
5. Maintained all game logic within the scene

This should resolve the ValueError while maintaining the architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

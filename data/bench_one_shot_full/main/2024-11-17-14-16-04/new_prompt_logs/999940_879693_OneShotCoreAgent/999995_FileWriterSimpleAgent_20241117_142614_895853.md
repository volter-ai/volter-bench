Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to give choices to swap creatures when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all remaining creatures are knocked out. We need to handle this case by checking if there are valid creatures before offering the swap choice.

The fix should be in main_game_scene.py by:
1. Only showing the "Swap" choice if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Adding proper handling when all creatures are knocked out

Here's the complete fixed file:

            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. In `_get_player_action`, we now check if there are valid creatures before adding the "Swap" choice
2. This ensures we never try to create an empty list of creature choices
3. The rest of the battle logic remains the same

This fix maintains the architecture and guidelines while preventing the empty choices error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

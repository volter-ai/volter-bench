Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the documentation. According to the docs, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should also have the option to go "Back" to the previous menu.

The fix will:
- Add a "Back" button to both the skill selection and creature swap menus
- Use a nested menu system where choosing "Back" returns None, causing the main menu to be shown again
- Keep the same model structure since this is purely a scene logic change
- Use the existing Button class from the engine for the Back option

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method:
1. Added a while True loop to handle returning to the main menu
2. Added a Back button to both the skill selection and creature swap menus
3. When Back is chosen, the continue statement returns to the main menu
4. Kept the same model structure since this is purely a scene logic change

This implementation now fully matches the documentation's requirement for a Back option in the Player Choice Phase.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

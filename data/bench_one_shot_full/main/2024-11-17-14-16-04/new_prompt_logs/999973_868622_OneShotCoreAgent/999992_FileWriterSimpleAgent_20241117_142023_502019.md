Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is going into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene until it hits quit, but we're not catching that exception.

Looking at the test output, we can see the scenes are transitioning back and forth multiple times before hitting quit. We need to:
1. Modify the test to properly catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Keep the scene transitions as they are (they're working correctly)
3. Make sure the test properly validates that the game loop worked before exiting

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: aed6ca27-caf0-4944-a211-077fc6d947e2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all handler to fail the test if any unexpected exceptions occur
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains the existing architecture while properly handling the game flow and exceptions. The scenes themselves are working correctly - they're transitioning between each other and eventually hitting quit as expected. We just needed to properly handle that quit condition in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods or properties. The solution is to:

1. Remove all methods from the models
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Keep only the data attributes in the models
4. Handle creature HP reset directly in the scene when initializing the battle

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: fada8b6a-690d-4b19-937b-bb3946f698d1
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And the corresponding change needed in main_game_scene.py for the reset logic:

# Excerpt ID: 71559d9d-d0ca-4156-9653-d1cd9cadb002
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset logic moved here from models
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Initialize active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    # ... rest of the file remains the same ...
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed all methods from the model classes
2. Moved the reset logic into the scene initialization
3. Kept models as pure data schemas
4. Scene now handles all the logic for managing creature HP

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while preserving all the functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

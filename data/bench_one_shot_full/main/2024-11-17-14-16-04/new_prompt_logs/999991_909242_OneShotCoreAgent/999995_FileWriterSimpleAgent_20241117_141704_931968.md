Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene initialization

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 76842dfe-4569-46f9-b723-afc190880e10
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    damage: int
    category: str = "Skill"

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]
    category: str = "Creature"

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    category: str = "Player"
```

# Excerpt ID: d298fdcd-1598-43f8-ae80-8ce3b7a75c67
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle has started between {self.player.display_name} and {self.bot.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            ).thing

            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            ).thing

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You won! {self.bot_creature.display_name} was defeated!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You lost! {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into MainGameScene's __init__
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

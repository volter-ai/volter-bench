## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing implementation for random turn order when creatures have the same speed in the MainGameScene, I will modify the `_resolve_turns` method in the MainGameScene class. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. Add a check to compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
2. If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. Implement the turn resolution based on the randomly determined order when speeds are equal.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This updated `main_game_scene.py` file now includes the implementation for random turn order when creatures have the same speed. The `_resolve_turns` method has been modified to handle this case, ensuring that the game follows the specified rules for turn order resolution.

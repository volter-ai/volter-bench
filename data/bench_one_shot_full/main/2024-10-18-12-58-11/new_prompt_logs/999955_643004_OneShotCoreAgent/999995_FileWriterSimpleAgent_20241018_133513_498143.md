## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll update the `run` method to properly handle the end of the battle by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game based on the player's choice.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Properly handling the end of the battle in the `run` method.
2. Adding a choice for the player to return to the main menu or quit the game after the battle ends.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` to ensure the scene exits correctly.
4. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game.

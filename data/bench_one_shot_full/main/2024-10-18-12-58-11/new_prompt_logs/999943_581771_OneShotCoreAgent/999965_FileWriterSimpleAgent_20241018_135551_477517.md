## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The fix will involve setting the first creature as the active creature for both the player and the opponent at the start of the scene.

Here's how I will fix this issue:

1. In the `__init__` method of the `MainGameScene` class, I'll add logic to set the first creature as the active creature for both the player and the opponent.
2. This change will ensure that the active creature is set explicitly at the start of the scene, as required by the architecture documentation.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e40e0dab-d2da-4fe0-aa2e-5112db88d91b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        
        # Set the first creature as active for both player and opponent
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

```

This modification addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing by explicitly setting the first creature as the active creature for both the player and the opponent in the `__init__` method of the `MainGameScene` class. This change aligns the implementation with the architecture documentation while maintaining the overall structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

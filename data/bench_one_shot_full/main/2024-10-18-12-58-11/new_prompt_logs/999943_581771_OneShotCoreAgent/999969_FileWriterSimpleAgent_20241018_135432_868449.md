## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase for both the attack and swap choices.
2. Implement the random decision for turn order when creatures have the same speed.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `player_choice_phase` method, I'll add a 'Back' button to both the attack and swap choice menus.
2. In the `resolution_phase` method, I'll modify the sorting of actions to include a random tiebreaker when creatures have the same speed.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choice menus in the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods.
2. The random decision for turn order when creatures have the same speed is now implemented in the `resolution_phase` method by using `random.random()` as a tiebreaker in the sorting key.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After a battle ends (win or lose), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll restructure the game loop to continue running until explicitly told to stop.
3. We'll add a method to reset the battle state, allowing for multiple battles in a single scene instance.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 4257cd64-eed1-4338-8c23-7fd927a70895
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.reset_battle()

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
                break
            self._player_turn()
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
                break
            self._opponent_turn()

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s turn!")
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It deals {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_battle` method to initialize or reset the battle state.
2. Introducing a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
3. Ensuring that the game loop continues until the battle is explicitly ended.
4. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, which properly exits the scene.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the identified issues. It ensures that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which should resolve the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Add random decision for turn order when creatures have the same speed.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `player_choice_phase` method to include a 'Back' option when choosing an attack or swap. This will allow players to return to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.

2. In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting of actions to include a random tiebreaker when creatures have the same speed.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods. Players can now go back to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.

2. The random decision for turn order when creatures have the same speed is implemented in the `resolution_phase` method. The `sort` function now uses a tuple as the key, where the second element is a random number. This ensures that when speeds are equal, the order is randomized.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the `execute_skill` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The `determine_order` method is returning tuples with three elements (attacker, attacker_creature, skill), but the `execute_skill` method expects four arguments (including self). We need to modify these methods to include the defender_creature in the tuple returned by `determine_order`.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. Modify the `determine_order` method to return tuples with four elements: (attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature).
2. Update the `resolution_phase` method to use these new tuples correctly.
3. Keep the `execute_skill` method signature the same, as it's correct.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 50c71820-819e-4362-83df-6ecf12d85940
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.opponent_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self):
        player_tuple = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        opponent_tuple = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return player_tuple, opponent_tuple
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return opponent_tuple, player_tuple
        else:
            return random.choice([(player_tuple, opponent_tuple), (opponent_tuple, player_tuple)])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the TypeError by ensuring that the `determine_order` method returns tuples with all four required arguments for the `execute_skill` method. The `resolution_phase` method remains unchanged, as it can now correctly unpack these tuples into the `execute_skill` method.

These changes should resolve the TypeError and allow the game to run properly. The overall structure and logic of the game remain the same, but now we're correctly passing all required arguments to the `execute_skill` method.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

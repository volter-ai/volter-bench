## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the reset of the creatures' state after a battle, as described in the architecture documents. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the state of the player's creatures after the battle ends.
2. We'll move the reset logic to the end of the run method, ensuring it happens regardless of the battle outcome.
3. We'll reset both the player's and the opponent's creatures to maintain consistency.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 4b7fc5c5-e3ac-40a8-8a13-bab46f42b06e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.opponent_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result()
        self.reset_creatures_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a new method `reset_creatures_state()` that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum values.
2. Calling `reset_creatures_state()` at the end of the `run()` method, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset after each battle, regardless of the outcome.
3. Displaying a message to inform the player that all creatures have been restored to full health.

These changes ensure that the creatures' states are reset after each battle, aligning with the architecture documents and resolving the discrepancy noted in the QA testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

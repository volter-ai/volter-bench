## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to include a 'Back' option when choosing an attack or swap. This will allow the player to go back to the main choice between attack and swap.

2. We'll add a `_reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP. We'll call this method when transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the current architecture without modifying the models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        return True
```

This solution addresses both issues raised in the QA/testing phase:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods. If the player selects 'Back', the method returns `None`, which causes the `_player_choice_phase` to loop back to the main choice between attack and swap.

2. A new `_reset_creatures_state` method has been added, which resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP. This method is called in the `_check_battle_end` method before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

These changes ensure that the player can go back in the choice phase and that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the scene, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing phase. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture without modifying the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

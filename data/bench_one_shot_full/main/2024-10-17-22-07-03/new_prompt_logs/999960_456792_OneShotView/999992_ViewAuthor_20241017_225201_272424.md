Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const {
        enabledUIDs
    } = useThingInteraction()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},

  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit





__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. The main container will be a flex column with items aligned center and justified between.

3. Title Image:
   We'll use a placeholder div for the game's title image at the top of the screen. In a real implementation, this would be replaced with an actual image component.

4. Button Section:
   We'll create a section at the bottom of the screen for the game buttons. We'll use the availableButtonSlugs array to dynamically render buttons based on what's available.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color to the main container to represent the main menu background.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Button Interaction:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks and trigger the appropriate action.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { enabledUIDs } = useThingInteraction();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="w-full h-1/3 flex items-center justify-center">
        <div className="bg-gray-700 w-2/3 h-full flex items-center justify-center text-4xl font-bold text-white">
          Game Title
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 h-12 text-lg"
              disabled={!enabledUIDs.includes(slug)}
            >
              <config.icon className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" />
              {config.label}
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a placeholder for the game title at the top and dynamically rendered buttons at the bottom. The layout uses Tailwind CSS classes to achieve the desired look and responsiveness. The component handles missing data gracefully and uses the provided utility functions for button interactions.

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issue with the uid prop and ensuring we follow all the guidelines.

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;

}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { enabledUIDs } = useThingInteraction();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="w-full h-1/3 flex items-center justify-center">
        <div className="bg-gray-700 w-2/3 h-full flex items-center justify-center text-4xl font-bold text-white">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              uid={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 h-12 text-lg"
              disabled={!enabledUIDs.includes(slug)}
            >
              <config.icon className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" />
              {config.label}
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. We've added the `uid` prop to the `Button` component, using the `slug` as the uid. This ensures that each custom UI component has a unique identifier.

2. We're now using the `props.data.display_name` for the game title, falling back to "Game Title" if it's not available. This makes better use of the provided GameUIData.

3. The rest of the implementation remains largely the same, as it already followed most of the guidelines:
   - It uses Tailwind CSS for styling
   - It handles button interactions using the provided utility functions
   - It checks for available buttons and enabled UIDs
   - It uses a 16:9 aspect ratio for the game container
   - It includes error handling for missing data (e.g., checking if config exists before rendering a button)

This corrected version should now meet all the specified requirements and guidelines.

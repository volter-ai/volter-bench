Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const {
        enabledUIDs
    } = useThingInteraction()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

    "__type": "MainMenuScene",

              },
              "entities": {},

}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit





__________________
Role: assistant
Content: To implement the MainMenuSceneView component based on the provided requirements, I'll use the following architecture and technical components:

1. Main Container:
   - Use a flex container to occupy the entire 16:9 game container.
   - Apply Tailwind classes for full width and height, and use flex-col to arrange items vertically.

2. Title Section:
   - Create a div for the title area at the top of the screen.
   - Use Tailwind classes for positioning and styling.
   - Display the game title prominently.

3. Button Section:
   - Create a div for the buttons at the bottom of the screen.
   - Use Tailwind classes for positioning and styling.
   - Implement a flex container to arrange buttons vertically or horizontally.

4. Button Components:
   - Use the Button component from shadcn/ui for consistent styling.
   - Render buttons based on the availableButtonSlugs from useCurrentButtons hook.
   - Implement onClick handlers using the emitButtonClick function.

5. Background:
   - Apply a background color or gradient using Tailwind classes to the main container.

6. Responsive Design:
   - Use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   - Implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's implement the component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      stats: Record<string, number>;
      meta: Record<string, any>;
      entities: Record<string, any>;
      collections: Record<string, any>;
      display_name: string;
      description: string;
    };
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const { enabledUIDs } = useThingInteraction();

  const buttonConfig = [
    { id: 'play', label: 'Play', icon: Play },
    { id: 'quit', label: 'Quit', icon: X },
  ];

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center">
          {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
        {buttonConfig.map((button) => (
          availableButtonSlugs.includes(button.id) && (
            <Button
              key={button.id}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(button.id)}
              className="w-48 h-12 text-lg"
              disabled={!enabledUIDs.includes(button.id)}
            >
              <button.icon className="mr-2 h-5 w-5" />
              {button.label}
            </Button>
          )
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation uses inline Tailwind styles to create the described view:

1. The main container uses `w-full h-full` to occupy the entire space, `flex flex-col` for vertical layout, and `bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600` for a gradient background.

2. The title section uses `flex-1 flex items-center justify-center` to center the title vertically and horizontally.

3. The button section uses `flex flex-col items-center space-y-4` to arrange buttons vertically with spacing.

4. Buttons use the Button component from shadcn/ui, with additional Tailwind classes for sizing and spacing.

5. Icons from Lucide React are incorporated into the buttons.

6. The component checks for available buttons using `availableButtonSlugs` and disables them based on `enabledUIDs`.

7. Error handling is implemented with optional chaining for the game title.

This implementation should create a visually appealing and functional main menu scene that adapts to the 16:9 game container and handles potential missing data.

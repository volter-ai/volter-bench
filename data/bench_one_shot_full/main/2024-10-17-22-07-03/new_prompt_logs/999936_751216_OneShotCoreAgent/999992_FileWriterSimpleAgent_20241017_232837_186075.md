## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The `turn_queue` attribute in `MainGameScene` is causing serialization warnings.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll add a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly.

2. We'll remove the `turn_queue` attribute from the `MainGameScene` class and instead use it as a local variable within the `resolution_phase` method. This will eliminate the serialization warnings.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 84fe36cd-ebb9-4517-898a-ebefc0217f27
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

These changes address both issues:

1. We've added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `battle_loop` method. This ensures that the scene properly transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends.

2. We've removed the `turn_queue` as a class attribute and instead use it as a local variable within the `resolution_phase` method. This eliminates the serialization warnings.

3. We've also slightly restructured the `battle_loop` and `resolution_phase` methods to make the flow clearer and more efficient.

These changes should resolve the test failures and warnings while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

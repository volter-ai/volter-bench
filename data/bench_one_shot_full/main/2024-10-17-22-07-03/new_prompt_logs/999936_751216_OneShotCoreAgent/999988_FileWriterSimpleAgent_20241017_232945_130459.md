## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement random selection for equal speeds during the resolution phase.
2. Add logic to reset the state of creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal. This will ensure that creatures with the same speed have an equal chance of going first.

2. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the state of all creatures for both the player and the opponent. We'll call this method when transitioning back to the main menu.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

These changes address both issues:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include `random.random()`. This ensures that when speeds are equal, the order is randomized.

2. We've added a `reset_creatures` method that restores all creatures to full health for both the player and the opponent. This method is called at the end of the `run` method, just before transitioning back to the main menu.

3. We've moved the transition to the main menu into the `run` method, after resetting the creatures. This ensures that the state is properly reset before leaving the scene.

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified, as all the changes are contained within the scene logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

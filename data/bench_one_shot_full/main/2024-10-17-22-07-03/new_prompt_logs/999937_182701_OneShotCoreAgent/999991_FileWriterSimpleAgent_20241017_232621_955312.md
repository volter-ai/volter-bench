## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll address both issues in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I plan to fix these problems:

1. Random turn order for creatures with the same speed:
   - In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal.

2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   - We'll add a new method `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` to handle this logic.
   - We'll call this method after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

These changes address both issues:

1. The random turn order for creatures with the same speed is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method. We've added a `random.random()` factor to the sorting key, which will be used as a tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

2. The forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is now handled by the new `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method. This method is called after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`, ensuring that fainted creatures are swapped out immediately.

These modifications align the implementation with the architecture documentation and address the discrepancies noted in the QA pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

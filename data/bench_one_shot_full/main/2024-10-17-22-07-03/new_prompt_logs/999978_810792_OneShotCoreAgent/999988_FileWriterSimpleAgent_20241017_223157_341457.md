## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the FixableException that occurs when trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys. This is happening because we're attempting to use AbstractThing (Player) instances as hashable keys in a dictionary, which is not allowed according to the engine's design.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. Instead of using Player objects as dictionary keys, we'll use their prototype_ids.
2. We'll modify the _resolve_turn method to use a list of tuples instead of a dictionary for storing skills.
3. We'll update the logic to match skills with players using the prototype_ids.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 4db1abda-22ea-4120-a50e-a61ca1ea9f32
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _determine_execution_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return [(self.player.prototype_id, self.player_creature), (self.opponent.prototype_id, self.opponent_creature)]
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return [(self.opponent.prototype_id, self.opponent_creature), (self.player.prototype_id, self.player_creature)]
        else:
            order = [(self.player.prototype_id, self.player_creature), (self.opponent.prototype_id, self.opponent_creature)]
            random.shuffle(order)
            return order

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        execution_order = self._determine_execution_order()
        skills = [(self.player.prototype_id, player_skill), (self.opponent.prototype_id, foe_skill)]

        for attacker_id, attacker_creature in execution_order:
            defender_id, defender_creature = next((p_id, c) for p_id, c in execution_order if p_id != attacker_id)
            attacker_skill = next(skill for p_id, skill in skills if p_id == attacker_id)
            attacker = self.player if attacker_id == self.player.prototype_id else self.opponent
            self._execute_skill(attacker, attacker_creature, attacker_skill, defender_creature)
            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                break

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the FixableException by:

1. Using `prototype_id` instead of Player objects as identifiers in the `_determine_execution_order` method.
2. Changing the `skills` variable in `_resolve_turn` from a dictionary to a list of tuples, using `prototype_id` as the identifier.
3. Modifying the logic in `_resolve_turn` to match skills with players using the `prototype_id`.

These changes ensure that we're not using AbstractThing (Player) instances as hashable keys, which was causing the FixableException. The solution maintains the existing architecture and models while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing random order resolution when creatures have the same speed during the skill execution phase, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to determine the order of skill execution based on creature speeds.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
3. We'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method to use this new order determination.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 60470798-3a90-4da0-942b-dcb661754d9d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_turn()

    def _determine_execution_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return [(self.player, self.player_creature), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)]
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a new `_determine_execution_order` method that decides the order of skill execution based on creature speeds.
2. If the speeds are equal, it uses `random.shuffle()` to randomize the order.
3. Modifying the `_resolve_turn` method to use this new order determination.

The changes ensure that when creatures have the same speed, the order of skill execution is randomly determined, as specified in the architecture documents. This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models.

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the rewritten code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. This will ensure the content is properly positioned and responsive.

3. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient using Tailwind classes to create an appealing backdrop for the main menu.

4. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top center of the screen using large, bold text.

5. Buttons:
   We'll create a section at the bottom center of the screen to display the available buttons (play, quit) using the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from useCurrentButtons.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

8. Icons:
   We'll use Lucide React icons to enhance the visual appeal of the buttons.

Using Inline Tailwind Styles:

We'll use Tailwind CSS classes directly in the JSX to style our components. This approach allows for rapid development and easy customization. We'll use classes for layout (flex, justify-center, items-center), spacing (p-4, my-4), typography (text-4xl, font-bold), colors (bg-gradient-to-b, text-white), and more.

Now, let's rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 6900f946-df15-472c-b915-f8ef3e133d32
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const {
    enabledUIDs
  } = useThingInteraction()

  const isButtonAvailable = (slug: string) => availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug);

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col justify-between items-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
        {isButtonAvailable('play') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold rounded-full transition duration-300 ease-in-out"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
            Play
          </button>
        )}
        {isButtonAvailable('quit') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold rounded-full transition duration-300 ease-in-out"
          >
            <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
            Quit
          </button>
        )}
      </div>

      <div className="mt-8 text-white text-sm">
        {props.data.entities.player && (
          <p>Welcome, {props.data.entities.player.display_name}!</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and buttons (Play and Quit) at the bottom. It uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling and layout, and Lucide React icons for the buttons. The component checks for available buttons and only renders them if they're available. It also displays a welcome message with the player's name if available.

The layout is responsive and should maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio within the game container. Error handling is implemented to prevent issues with missing data.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

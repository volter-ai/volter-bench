## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not handling ties in speed randomly during the Resolution Phase, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `resolve_actions` method to handle speed ties randomly.
2. We'll introduce a new helper method `sort_actions_by_speed` that will sort the actions based on speed and use random.shuffle for ties.
3. We'll keep the rest of the logic intact, ensuring we stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue of not handling ties in speed randomly during the Resolution Phase. The key changes are:

1. We introduced a new method `sort_actions_by_speed` that groups actions by speed, shuffles actions within each speed group, and then sorts the groups by speed.
2. In the `resolve_actions` method, we now use `sort_actions_by_speed` to determine the order of skill actions.

These changes ensure that when there's a tie in speed between creatures, the order of their actions is determined randomly, as required by the architecture.

The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns. The `Player`, `Creature`, and `Skill` classes remain as pure data schemas in the `models.py` file, while all the game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

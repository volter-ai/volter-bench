## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will either transition back to the main menu or quit the game.
2. We'll modify the battle_loop to call this new method when the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits properly by using the provided transition or quit methods.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 41ca25e2-536a-4858-a468-312e0757bfd1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self.bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def bot_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} uses {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        
        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that provides the player with options to play again or quit the game.
2. Modifying the `battle_loop` to call `end_battle` when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.
3. Using the `_transition_to_scene` and `_quit_whole_game` methods to properly exit the scene, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flows correctly between scenes and exits properly when needed.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

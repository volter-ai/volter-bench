## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state()` in the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max HP.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 27fa4798-e8d8-48c9-86a7-deee36f87d4b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):

            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill), (self.player, player_skill)

    def execute_turn(self, turn):
        attacker, skill = turn
        if attacker == self.player:
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            attacker_creature = self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds the `reset_creatures_state()` method to the MainGameScene class. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their maximum value. This addresses the issue raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

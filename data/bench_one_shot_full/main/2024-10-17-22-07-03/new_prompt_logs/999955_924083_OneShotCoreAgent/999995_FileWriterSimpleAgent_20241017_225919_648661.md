## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to ensure it doesn't terminate without proper scene transition.
3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 36349a67-f65f-4bdb-b1bb-76855ceb97c4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_turn()

            foe_skill = self._foe_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            self.battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._return_to_main_menu()

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_turn(self):

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the battle until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean.
4. Adding a `_return_to_main_menu` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing phase. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `transition_to_scene`, and it will properly exit the battle loop when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

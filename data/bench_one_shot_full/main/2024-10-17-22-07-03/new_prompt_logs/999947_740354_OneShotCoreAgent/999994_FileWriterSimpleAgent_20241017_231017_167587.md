## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not randomizing the order of skill execution when creatures have the same speed, I will modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture. It only requires a small modification to the `main_game_scene.py` file.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 356c1857-5f04-4b07-8798-92347d4db518
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:

    def get_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True

            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by randomizing the order of skill execution when the creatures have the same speed. The `resolve_turn` method now uses `random.sample` to randomly determine the order of execution when speeds are equal. This ensures that the game follows the requirement specified in the architecture documentation.

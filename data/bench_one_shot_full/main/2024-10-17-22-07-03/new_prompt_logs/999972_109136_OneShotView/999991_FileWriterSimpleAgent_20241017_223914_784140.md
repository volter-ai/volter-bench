## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the issues mentioned and adheres more closely to the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 407d4476-1604-4a7b-8bf7-ba1af295f2b3
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons, useThingInteraction } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const {
    enabledUIDs
  } = useThingInteraction()

  const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
    switch (slug) {
      case 'play':
        return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
      case 'quit':
        return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Creature Battle Game
      </h1>
      
      <Card className="p-6 bg-opacity-80 backdrop-blur-sm">
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-full"
            >
              {getButtonIcon(slug)}
              {slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1)}
            </Button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </Card>

      <div className="text-white text-sm mt-4">
        {data.entities.player && (
          <p>Welcome, {data.entities.player.display_name}!</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This updated version makes the following improvements:

1. It uses the shadcn `Button` and `Card` components, which were mentioned as preferred UI components.
2. The layout and styling have been adjusted to better fit the 16:9 game container while still being responsive.
3. The code structure has been simplified and cleaned up.
4. The `data` prop is now destructured in the function parameters for cleaner code.

While this version doesn't explicitly pass a `uid` prop to custom components (as there are no custom components that require it in this scene), it does use the shadcn components as requested. If in the future we need to add custom components that require a `uid`, we can easily incorporate them into this structure.

This code should now better adhere to the guidelines provided and offer a more consistent look with the rest of the application using the shadcn components.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

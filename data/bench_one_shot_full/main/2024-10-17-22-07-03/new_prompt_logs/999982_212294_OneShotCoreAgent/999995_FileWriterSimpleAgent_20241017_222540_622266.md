## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of the battle.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game or transition to a new scene after the battle concludes. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then either transition back to the main menu or quit the game.
3. We'll call this method at the end of the battle_loop when check_battle_end returns True.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1e649a8c-a9b8-4cb0-ba01-acc6b6366af2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        self.execute_skill(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player else opponent_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, opponent_skill if first == self.player else player_skill)

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        attacker_creature = attacker.creatures[0]
        defender_creature = defender.creatures[0]
        damage = max(0, attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")

        choices = [
            Button("Return to Main Menu"),
            Button("Quit Game")
        ]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly ends the battle and either transitions back to the main menu or quits the game, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing. The scene will now exit in an expected manner, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game entirely.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

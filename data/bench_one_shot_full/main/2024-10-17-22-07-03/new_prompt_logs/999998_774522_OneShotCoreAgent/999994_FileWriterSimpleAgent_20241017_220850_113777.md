## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of both the player's and bot's creatures to their maximum HP.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: bebccd41-7f29-40b8-8cee-caaf445c22a1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            bot_skill = self.bot_turn()
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot's turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Bot used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Bot dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This solution adds the `reset_creatures()` method to the MainGameScene class. This method resets the HP of both the player's and bot's creatures to their maximum HP. The method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' HP is reset for the next battle.

This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The game logic remains within the scene, and we're using the existing methods like `_show_text` to inform the player about the reset.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

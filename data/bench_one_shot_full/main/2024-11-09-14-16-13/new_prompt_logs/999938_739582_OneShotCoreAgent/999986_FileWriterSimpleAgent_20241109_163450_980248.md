Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the test output, this exception is expected and should be caught. Looking at other tests in the codebase, we should:

- Keep using _quit_whole_game() in the MainGameScene when battle ends
- Modify the test to properly catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
- Keep all the game logic intact
- Stay within the engine's architecture

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 6d5945ea-a49c-4d05-94b8-fda80c2863c6
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully: {str(e)}")
                continue  # Continue to next iteration
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Modified the try/except block to catch both expected exceptions
3. Added proper exception handling flow
4. Added logging to show graceful exits
5. Maintained the ability to catch unexpected errors

This fix:
- Stays within the engine's architecture
- Doesn't modify any models
- Properly handles the expected game termination
- Maintains the random testing approach
- Keeps all game logic intact

The test will now pass as it properly handles both ways the game can gracefully end: either through the random mode counter reaching zero or through the battle ending naturally.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

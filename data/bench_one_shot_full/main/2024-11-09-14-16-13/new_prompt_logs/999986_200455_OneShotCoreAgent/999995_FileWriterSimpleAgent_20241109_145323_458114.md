Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When a battle ends, the MainGameScene calls _quit_whole_game() which raises this exception. In the test, we need to catch this exception as an expected outcome, similar to how we handle RandomModeGracefulExit.

The fix is simple - we just need to modify the test_main_game_scene.py file to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception as a valid end state for the scene, since that's how our battle scene signals completion.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 9aacb0c1-f642-4a45-a8c7-b7c7e7aaa09c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print("Random mode completed")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print("Battle completed with a winner")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Adds a catch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame as a valid end state
3. Adds an additional catch for unexpected exceptions that will fail the test
4. Maintains all the existing architecture and engine capabilities
5. Doesn't require any changes to the models or game logic

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the scene can end - either through RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves are exhausted) or through _QuitWholeGame (when a battle concludes).

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

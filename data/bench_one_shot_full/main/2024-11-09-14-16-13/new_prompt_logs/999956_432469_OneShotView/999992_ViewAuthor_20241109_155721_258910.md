Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},

              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {

                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",

                  },
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 5

    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (prominent)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative
     - Bottom: Button controls

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Using Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Flex layouts for positioning
   - CSS Grid for button arrangement
   - Maintaining 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom technique
   - Centered content both horizontally and vertically

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with relative positioning
   - Inner container for content with absolute positioning
   - Button group with grid layout
   - Responsive text sizing

4. **Interactive Elements**:
   - Button handling through `emitButtonClick`
   - Conditional rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`
   - Hover effects for buttons

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameStats {
    [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
    prototype_id: string;
    category: string;
    [key: string]: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
    __type: string;
    stats: GameStats;
    meta: GameMeta;
    entities: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
    __type: 'Player';
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: Player;
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return (
        <div className="relative w-full" style={{ paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>
            <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
                {/* Title Section */}
                <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                    <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                        GAME TITLE
                    </h1>
                </div>

                {/* Button Section */}
                <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full max-w-md">
                    {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                        <button
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white py-4 px-8 rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                        >
                            <Play className="w-6 h-6" />
                            Play Game
                        </button>
                    )}

                    {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                        <button
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white py-4 px-8 rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                        >
                            <XCircle className="w-6 h-6" />
                            Quit
                        </button>
                    )}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a responsive 16:9 container using padding-bottom technique
- Uses a dark gradient background
- Centers the title text
- Creates prominent buttons with icons
- Includes hover effects and transitions
- Handles button availability through conditional rendering
- Uses Lucide icons for visual enhancement
- Is fully responsive and maintains aspect ratio
- Includes proper TypeScript interfaces for data handling
- Uses Tailwind for all styling needs

The buttons are large and easily clickable, and the layout maintains proper spacing and hierarchy. The gradient background adds depth without requiring additional assets.

If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

  "explanation": "The code needs some adjustments:\n\n1. We don't pass any uid props to custom components because we're not using any custom UI components from shadcn/ui. The VIEW_SUMMARY didn't specify any specific custom components needed, but we should probably use Button from shadcn/ui instead of raw HTML buttons.\n\n2. The interfaces could be simplified since we don't actually use most of the data from GameUIData in this view - we're only showing buttons and a title.\n\n3. We should add error boundaries or null checks for the data prop itself.\n\n4. The gradient background might need to be configurable or match the game's theme better.\n\nLet's mark this as not ok to use and create an updated version that addresses these points.",

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Used shadcn's Button component instead of raw HTML buttons
2. Simplified the GameUIData interface to only what we need
3. Added null check for props.data
4. Removed custom gradient and used theme-aware background colors
5. Used theme-aware text colors (primary)
6. Kept the 16:9 aspect ratio container
7. Maintained the same layout structure but with more consistent spacing
8. Removed unnecessary interfaces
9. Used shadcn's built-in button variants for consistent styling
10. Made buttons larger and more prominent with additional padding

The component now better integrates with the shadcn component library while maintaining the same functionality and layout structure described in the VIEW_SUMMARY.

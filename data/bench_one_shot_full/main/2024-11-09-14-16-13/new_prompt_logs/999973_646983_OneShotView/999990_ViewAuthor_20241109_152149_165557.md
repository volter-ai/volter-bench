Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"

        </HoverCardTrigger>
        <HoverCardContent uid={uid}>

      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.

Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Use a flex container for the full viewport (h-screen w-screen)
- Divide into three main sections vertically:
  * Top: HUD/Navigation bar (1/8 height)
  * Middle: Battlefield (1/2 height)
  * Bottom: UI/Controls area (3/8 height)

2. Battlefield Design:
- Horizontal flex container with justify-between
- Left side: Player creature using CreatureCard
- Right side: Opponent creature using CreatureCard
- Visual indicators using Tailwind classes for positioning

3. UI Area:
- Container for skill buttons using SkillButton components
- Grid layout for multiple skills
- Responsive design using Tailwind's grid system

4. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for safe data access
- Implement proper type checking

5. Styling Strategy:
- Use Tailwind classes for layout and spacing
- Implement responsive design
- Use flex and grid for alignment
- Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio using aspect-video

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    base_damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
    attack: number
    defense: number
    speed: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    bot_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video flex flex-col">
      {/* HUD */}
      <div className="h-1/8 bg-secondary p-4 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-4">

          <span>{playerCreature?.stats.defense || 0}</span>
          <Zap className="h-6 w-6" />

This implementation:
1. Creates proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Uses custom components as specified
3. Implements a responsive layout with Tailwind
4. Handles missing data safely
5. Maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio
6. Provides visual feedback for player/opponent creatures
7. Shows creature stats in the HUD
8. Displays skills in a grid layout
9. Uses proper spacing and positioning

The layout is divided into three main sections as specified, with the battlefield taking the central focus and the UI elements properly positioned above and below.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

  "explanation": "Let me check each custom component usage:\n\n1. CreatureCard:\n- \u2713 uid prop is passed correctly from creature.uid\n- \u2713 name prop is passed from display_name\n- \u2713 currentHp and maxHp are passed correctly\n- \u26a0\ufe0f imageUrl assumes a path structure that wasn't specified in requirements\n\n2. SkillButton:\n- \u2713 uid prop is passed correctly from skill.uid\n- \u2713 name prop is passed from display_name\n- \u2713 description prop is passed correctly\n- \u2713 stats object is passed with correct structure\n\nIssues found:\n1. We're missing proper type checking for meta.prototype_id which is used in image paths\n2. We should handle the case where collections.skills might be undefined\n3. We should add null checks for playerCreature and botCreature before accessing their properties\n4. The HUD is accessing stats directly without null checks\n\nThe code needs some safety improvements and shouldn't make assumptions about image paths.",

Key improvements made:
1. Added proper null checking throughout with optional chaining
2. Split rendering logic into separate functions for better organization
3. Made skills array optional in Creature interface
4. Added proper type checking for meta.prototype_id
5. Added fallback default.png for creature images
6. Made creature properties optional in GameUIData interface
7. Added null coalescing operators for numerical values
8. Added proper type safety for all nested properties
9. Separated complex rendering logic into pure functions
10. Maintained all required uid props for custom components

The code now safely handles:
- Missing creatures
- Missing skills
- Missing stats
- Missing meta data
- Missing prototype IDs
- Undefined collections

While still maintaining the same visual layout and functionality.

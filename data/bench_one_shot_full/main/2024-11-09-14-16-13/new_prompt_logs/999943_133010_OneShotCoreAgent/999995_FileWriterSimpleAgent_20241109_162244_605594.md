Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being provided during initialization. The error occurs because we defined `active_creature` as `Creature | None` without making it a Field with a default value.

To fix this, we need to:
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Use the Field system properly to define optional fields with defaults
- Make `active_creature` a proper optional Field that defaults to None

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 6970d9d9-4de6-455e-b930-295c43f1dd6b
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = Field(default=None)
```

The key change is converting `active_creature: Creature | None` to `active_creature: Optional[Creature] = Field(default=None)`. This properly defines it as an optional field with a default value of None, which satisfies the validation requirements while maintaining the pure data schema approach.

This change follows all guidelines:
- Models still inherit from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
- Models remain pure data schemas without methods
- Uses the Field system properly for optional values
- Maintains type safety with Optional[Creature]

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

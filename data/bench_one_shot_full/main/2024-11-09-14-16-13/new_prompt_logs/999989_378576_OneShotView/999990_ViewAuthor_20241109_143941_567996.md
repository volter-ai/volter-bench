Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

interface SkillButtonProps {
  uid: string
  name: string
  description: string
  stats: string
  onClick?: () => void
  disabled?: boolean
}

let SkillButton = ({
  uid,
  name,
  description,
  stats,
  onClick,
  disabled
}: SkillButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <HoverCard uid={`${uid}-hover`}>
      <HoverCardTrigger uid={`${uid}-trigger`} asChild>
        <Button
          uid={`${uid}-button`}
          variant="default"
          onClick={onClick}
          disabled={disabled}
          className="w-[200px]"
        >
          {name}
        </Button>
      </HoverCardTrigger>
      <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-content`} className="w-80">
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h4 className="text-sm font-semibold">{name}</h4>
          <p className="text-sm">{description}</p>
          <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
            {stats}
          </div>
        </div>
      </HoverCardContent>
    </HoverCard>
  )
}

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardContent,
} from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Card> {
  uid: string
  name: string
  imageUrl: string
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-[300px]", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
        <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>

        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"

}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, hp, maxHp, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <Card 
        ref={ref} 
        className={cn("w-[300px]", className)}

        {...props}
      >
        <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
          <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>

          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <img

              alt={name}
              className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
            />
            <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
              <span>HP:</span>
              <span>{hp}/{maxHp}</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Use a flex-column layout for the entire screen (h-screen)
- Top: HUD navbar (h-16)
- Middle: Battlefield (flex-grow)
- Bottom: UI area (h-1/3)

2. Component Organization:
- Main container with flex-col
- Battlefield will use flex-row with justify-between for creature spacing
- Bottom UI will be a card component containing either text or buttons

3. Tailwind Classes:
```
Main Container: h-screen w-full flex flex-col
HUD: h-16 bg-primary/10
Battlefield: flex-grow flex items-center justify-between px-12
Bottom UI: h-1/3 bg-secondary/10 p-4
```

4. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for safe data access
- Implement null checks for rendering conditions

5. Custom Components Usage:
- CreatureCard for both player and opponent creatures
- SkillButton for available skills in the UI area
- PlayerCard for player information in the HUD

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    bot_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full flex flex-col bg-background">
      <nav className="h-16 bg-primary/10 flex items-center justify-between px-4">
        <PlayerCard
          uid={props.data.entities.player.uid}
          name={props.data.entities.player.display_name}
          imageUrl="/player.png"
        />
        <div className="flex items-center gap-4">
          <Shield className="w-6 h-6" />
          <Swords className="w-6 h-6" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      <main className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-between px-12">
        {playerCreature && (
          <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-2">
            <span className="text-sm font-bold">Your Creature</span>
            <CreatureCard
              uid={playerCreature.uid}
              name={playerCreature.display_name}
              hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/creature.png"
            />
          </div>
        )}

        {botCreature && (
          <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-2">
            <span className="text-sm font-bold">Opponent's Creature</span>
            <CreatureCard
              uid={botCreature.uid}
              name={botCreature.display_name}
              hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={botCreature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/creature.png"
            />
          </div>

This implementation:
1. Creates a full-screen layout with proper spacing
2. Uses custom components as specified
3. Implements safe data access with optional chaining
4. Provides a clean battlefield layout with creature positioning
5. Includes a bottom UI area for skills
6. Uses the HUD for player information and game icons
7. Properly handles the button states through availableButtonSlugs

Note: The implementation assumes image paths (/player.png, /creature.png) exist in your public directory. You'll need to adjust these paths according to your actual image assets.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

SkillButton:\n\u2713 uid prop is correctly passed from skill.uid in the map function\n\nHowever, there are a few issues to address:\n\n1. The VIEW_DATA shows that skills have a specific structure with __type: \"Skill\", but we're not checking this in our type definitions.\n2. We should verify the __type field in our interfaces for Player and Creature as well.\n3. We should add null checks for the entities themselves before accessing their properties.\n4. The interfaces should match the exact structure from VIEW_DATA, including meta fields.\n\nThe code needs these improvements to be fully type-safe and match the data structure exactly. Therefore, it's not ok to use yet.",

Key improvements made:
1. Added complete type definitions matching VIEW_DATA structure including meta, entities, and collections
2. Added type guards checking `__type` field before rendering components
3. Added null checks for entities at the top level
4. Used prototype_id from meta for image paths
5. Added proper empty object types using Record<string, never>
6. Added filter to ensure only skills with correct __type are rendered
7. Destructured entities at the top for cleaner code
8. Maintained all proper uid passing to custom components
9. Kept the same layout structure but with better type safety

The code now properly handles the data structure shown in VIEW_DATA while maintaining the layout requirements from VIEW_SUMMARY.

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Player",
        "description": "A creature trainer"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex layout with vertical direction
   - Two main sections: Title area (top) and Button area (bottom)

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Using Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Flexbox for centering and spacing
   - Main container will use aspect-ratio utilities
   - Background styling for the menu backdrop

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with proper aspect ratio
   - Title section taking ~40% of vertical space
   - Button section taking ~60% of vertical space
   - Buttons will be conditionally rendered based on availableButtonSlugs

4. **Responsive Considerations**:
   - Container will maintain 16:9 ratio
   - Content will scale appropriately
   - Using relative units for spacing

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameStats {
  [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
  prototype_id: string;
  category: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
  __type: string;
  stats: GameStats;
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
  __type: 'Player';
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
      {/* 16:9 Container */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12 aspect-video max-h-full max-w-full mx-auto">
        {/* Title Section */}
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
            GAME TITLE
          </h1>
        </div>

        {/* Button Section */}
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
            >
              <Play size={24} />
              <span>Play Game</span>
            </button>
          )}

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
            >
              <XCircle size={24} />
              <span>Quit</span>
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen container with proper aspect ratio
- Centers the title and buttons
- Uses Lucide icons for visual enhancement
- Implements proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
- Conditionally renders buttons based on availability
- Uses Tailwind for styling with a dark theme
- Maintains responsive design
- Includes hover effects and transitions for better UX
- Handles the game state through button clicks

The styling ensures the menu looks professional while maintaining the specified layout requirements. The buttons are prominent and clearly visible at the bottom, while the title area dominates the top portion of the screen.

We didn't follow the pattern of passing UIDs to custom components (though we aren't using any in this case, we should document this in a comment for future additions)\n\n2.

              className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-primary hover:bg-primary/90 text-primary-foreground rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
            >
              <Play size={24} />
              <span>Play Game</span>
            </button>
          )}

          {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('quit') && (

              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-destructive hover:bg-destructive/90 text-destructive-foreground rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"

          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Kept the original GameUIData interface structure
2. Added note about UID requirements for custom components
3. Used shadcn Card component for the background
4. Used shadcn color tokens (primary, destructive) instead of raw colors
5. Added elvis operators for safer null checking
6. Simplified interfaces to only what's needed
7. Maintained the 16:9 aspect ratio requirement
8. Kept the original imports structure
9. Used proper semantic HTML structure

The component now better follows the established patterns while maintaining the same visual structure and functionality.

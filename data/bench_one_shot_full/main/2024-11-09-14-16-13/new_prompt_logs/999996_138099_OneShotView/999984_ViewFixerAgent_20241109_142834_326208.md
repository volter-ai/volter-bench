# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from '@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card'
import { SkillButton } from '@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button'
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player?.collections?.creatures?.[0]
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot?.collections?.creatures?.[0]

  if (!playerCreature || !botCreature) {
    return <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading...
    </div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    emitButtonClick(skillUid)
  }

  const isSkillAvailable = (skillUid: string): boolean => {
    return Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex flex-col">
      <nav className="h-16 w-full bg-primary flex items-center justify-between px-4">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Shield className="h-6 w-6" />
          <span>Battle Arena</span>
        </div>
        <Swords className="h-6 w-6" />
      </nav>

          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${playerCreature.display_name.toLowerCase()}.png`}
          />
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <span className="text-lg font-bold">Opponent</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}

            maxHp={botCreature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${botCreature.display_name.toLowerCase()}.png`}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="h-1/3 bg-secondary p-4 flex flex-col gap-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills?.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              name={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!isSkillAvailable(skill.uid)}
              onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
1. The error indicates a timeout after 120s, suggesting the UI simulator couldn't complete its intended interactions
2. Looking at the image, I can see:
   - The battlefield layout is correct with player/opponent creatures
   - Only one skill button ("Tackle") is visible
   - The UI area appears to be pushed towards the bottom
3. The main issue seems to be that the skill buttons aren't properly accessible for interaction, which is causing the UI simulator to fail

**Problems Identified:**
1. The height allocation using `h-screen` and `h-1/3` may be causing layout issues
2. The skill buttons grid might be overflowing or getting cut off
3. The UI area's padding and layout could be preventing proper button interaction

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Replace `h-screen` with `min-h-screen` to ensure proper content fitting
2. Adjust the UI area's height and layout to ensure buttons are visible and clickable
3. Modify the grid layout to better accommodate skill buttons
4. Add overflow handling for the skill buttons area

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from '@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card'
import { SkillButton } from '@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button'
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player?.collections?.creatures?.[0]
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot?.collections?.creatures?.[0]

  if (!playerCreature || !botCreature) {
    return <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading...
    </div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    emitButtonClick(skillUid)
  }

  const isSkillAvailable = (skillUid: string): boolean => {
    return Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full min-h-screen flex flex-col">
      <nav className="h-16 w-full bg-primary flex items-center justify-between px-4">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Shield className="h-6 w-6" />
          <span>Battle Arena</span>
        </div>
        <Swords className="h-6 w-6" />
      </nav>

      <div className="flex-1 flex justify-between items-center px-8 bg-background py-8">

          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${playerCreature.display_name.toLowerCase()}.png`}
          />
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <span className="text-lg font-bold">Opponent</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={botCreature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${botCreature.display_name.toLowerCase()}.png`}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="min-h-[200px] bg-secondary p-4">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 auto-rows-max overflow-y-auto">
          {playerCreature.collections.skills?.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              name={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              disabled={!isSkillAvailable(skill.uid)}
              onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed `h-screen` to `min-h-screen` to prevent content cutoff
2. Removed `h-1/3` and replaced with `min-h-[200px]` for the UI area
3. Added `py-8` to the battlefield area for better spacing
4. Modified the grid layout to be responsive and added `auto-rows-max`
5. Added `overflow-y-auto` to handle potential overflow of skill buttons

These changes should ensure that all UI elements are properly visible and interactive, resolving the timeout issue in the UI simulator.

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Player",
        "description": "A creature trainer"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex layout with vertical direction
   - Two main sections: Title area (top) and Button area (bottom)

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom trick
   - Center content both horizontally and vertically
   - Create a game-like appearance with proper spacing

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with relative positioning
   - Inner container with absolute positioning for proper scaling
   - Title section taking up roughly 1/3 of vertical space
   - Button section taking bottom portion with proper spacing

4. **Button Handling**:
   - Use `availableButtonSlugs` to conditionally render buttons
   - Implement `emitButtonClick` for button interactions
   - Style buttons with game-like appearance

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameStats {
  [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
  prototype_id: string;
  category: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
  __type: string;
  stats: GameStats;
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
  __type: 'Player';
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  return (
    <div className="relative w-full" style={{ paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
        
        {/* Title Section */}
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
            CREATURE GAME
          </h1>
        </div>

        {/* Button Section */}
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 w-64">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 w-full py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg transition-colors"
            >
              <Play size={24} />
              <span className="text-xl">Play Game</span>
            </button>
          )}

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 w-full py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg transition-colors"
            >
              <XCircle size={24} />
              <span className="text-xl">Quit</span>
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
- Maintains 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom technique
- Creates a dark gradient background
- Centers the title text
- Places buttons at the bottom with proper spacing
- Includes icons from Lucide
- Uses Tailwind for responsive design
- Handles button availability through availableButtonSlugs
- Implements proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
- Uses proper fail-safes for button rendering
- Creates an attractive game-like appearance

The buttons are styled with hover effects and proper spacing, and the layout is fully responsive while maintaining the aspect ratio. The gradient background provides depth without requiring additional assets.

  "explanation": "The code needs some adjustments:\n\n1. Looking at the VIEW_DATA, we can see that every entity has a uid property that should be passed to components. However, since this is a view component and doesn't render any custom UI components (only native HTML elements and Lucide icons), this isn't a concern here.\n\n2. The code follows most guidelines:\n   - Maintains existing imports\n   - Uses Tailwind for styling\n   - Implements proper TypeScript interfaces\n   - Has null-safety checks for button rendering\n   - Only uses built-in elements and Lucide icons\n\n3. However, there are a few issues:\n   - The title \"CREATURE GAME\" is hardcoded when it should probably come from props.data\n   - The interfaces could be more complete based on the VIEW_DATA (missing collections, meta, etc.)\n   - We should add proper aria-labels for accessibility\n\nTherefore, the code needs revision.",

  );
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added more complete interfaces matching the VIEW_DATA structure
2. Used props.data.display_name for the title with fallback
3. Added proper aria labels and roles for accessibility
4. Added aria-hidden="true" to decorative icons
5. Maintained all the good parts from previous version:
   - 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Responsive design
   - Proper button handling
   - Gradient background
   - Proper spacing and layout
   - Type safety
   - Null checks

The component now better reflects the data structure and has improved accessibility while maintaining all the visual and functional requirements.

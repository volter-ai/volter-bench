Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test should expect and handle this exception since it's a normal part of game termination. This is a test issue, not a game logic issue.

The fix should:
- Modify test_main_game_scene.py to catch _QuitWholeGame
- Keep all game logic intact
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Not modify any models

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 4f74901a-397c-43f2-bfd1-fdd4073dd369
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception in run {i}: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Import AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Add exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Add catch-all handler to fail test on unexpected exceptions
4. Keep all other test logic intact
5. No changes to game logic or models needed

This maintains the architecture while fixing the test by properly handling the expected game termination exception.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

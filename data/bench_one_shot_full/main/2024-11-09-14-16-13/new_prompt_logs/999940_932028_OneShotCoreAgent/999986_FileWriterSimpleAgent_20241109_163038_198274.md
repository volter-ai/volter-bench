Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine architecture:
- Scenes must either transition to another scene or quit the game
- Breaking from the game loop is an antipattern
- We need to transition back to MainMenuScene or quit after battle ends

The solution is to:
- After battle ends, give player choice to play again or quit
- Use proper scene transitions/quit calls
- Keep within engine capabilities using choices

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

Key changes:
1. Added proper scene exit handling in run() method
2. After battle ends, player chooses between playing again or quitting
3. Uses proper scene transitions (_transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game)
4. Maintains engine architecture and capabilities
5. Keeps models as pure data schemas

This solution ensures the scene always exits properly through the engine's supported mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to show swap choices when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all non-active creatures are fainted (hp <= 0). We need to handle this case by only showing the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to.

The fix should be in main_game_scene.py since this is game logic, not model logic. We'll modify the get_player_action method to only show the swap option if there are valid creatures to swap to.

```

The key changes are:
1. Check for valid swap targets before offering the swap option
2. Only show swap button if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. This prevents the empty choices list error while maintaining game logic
4. No changes needed to models since this is purely game logic
5. Stays within engine capabilities by using existing Button and SelectThing choices

This maintains the architecture while fixing the bug by keeping all game logic in the scene and not modifying the data models.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

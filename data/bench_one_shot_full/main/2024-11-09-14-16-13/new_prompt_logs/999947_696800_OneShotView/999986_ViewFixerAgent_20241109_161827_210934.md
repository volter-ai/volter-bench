# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
1. The UI simulator is timing out after 120s, suggesting it cannot find or interact with clickable elements
2. Looking at the image, I can see:
   - The creature cards are visible with HP bars
   - The creature placeholders are showing just text names instead of proper sprites
   - Most importantly, there appears to be no visible skill buttons in the bottom UI area where they should be

The main problem seems to be that the skill buttons are either not rendering or not properly laid out in the UI area.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. The grid layout for the skills area needs to be fixed. Currently it's using `grid-cols-2` which may be causing layout issues
2. We should ensure the skills array exists before mapping
3. We need to add proper styling to make the buttons more visible and clickable
4. The grid gap might be too large, pushing buttons off-screen

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"

  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    opponent: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    opponent_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data?.entities?.player_creature
  const opponentCreature = props.data?.entities?.opponent_creature

  if (!playerCreature || !opponentCreature) {
    return <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
      Loading battle...
    </div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs?.includes(skillUid)) {
      emitButtonClick(skillUid)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="relative w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      {/* Battlefield Area */}
      <div className="flex-grow grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 p-4">
        {/* Top Left - Opponent Status */}
        <div className="flex justify-start items-start">

        </div>

        {/* Top Right - Opponent Creature */}
        <div className="flex justify-end items-start">

              {opponentCreature.display_name}
            </div>
            <div className="absolute bottom-0 w-full h-4 bg-black/20 rounded-full blur-sm" />
          </div>

            </div>

          </div>
        </div>

        {/* Bottom Right - Player Status */}
        <div className="flex justify-end items-end">
          <CreatureCard

            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* UI Area */}
      <div className="h-1/3 bg-white/5">
        <div className="p-4 grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 h-full">
          {playerCreature.collections?.skills?.map((skill) => (
            availableButtonSlugs?.includes(skill.uid) && (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                damage={skill.stats.base_damage}
                type={skill.meta.skill_type}
                onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            )
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Restructured the UI area to ensure proper height and visibility
2. Reduced grid gap from 4 to 2 to prevent buttons from being pushed off-screen
3. Added a subtle background to the UI area for better visibility
4. Simplified the skill rendering logic to use short-circuit evaluation
5. Ensured the grid container takes full height of the UI area

These changes should make the skill buttons visible and clickable, resolving the timeout issue in the UI simulator.

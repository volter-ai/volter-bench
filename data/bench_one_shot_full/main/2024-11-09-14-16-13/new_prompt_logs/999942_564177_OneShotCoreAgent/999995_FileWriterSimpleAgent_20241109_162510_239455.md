Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that is required but not provided in the JSON data. Since the active creature is meant to be set during gameplay (in MainGameScene), we should make it Optional in the model.

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Import Optional from typing in models.py
2. Make active_creature an Optional field in the Player model
3. This allows the field to be None by default when loading from JSON
4. The MainGameScene will set it when battle starts

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: dfb6dc4c-32c4-4732-adac-26cf10313b5e
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change:
1. Follows the model guidelines by keeping models as pure data schemas
2. Uses proper typing with Optional
3. Allows Player instances to be created without an active_creature
4. Still allows active_creature to be set during gameplay
5. Maintains compatibility with the engine's validation system

The MainGameScene can then safely set active_creature when the battle starts, as it was already doing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

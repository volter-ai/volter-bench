Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that's raised when the game ends in random mode. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at the test output, we can see the game is running correctly (creatures are battling, taking damage, fainting, etc.) but the test fails when the battle ends and `_quit_whole_game()` is called.

The solution is to update the test file to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions, as both are valid ways for the random test to end.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 12658591-7dba-4d65-8542-ff7fc9e81675
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access `_QuitWholeGame`
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added descriptive print message for both types of graceful exits

This fix:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Doesn't modify any models
- Properly handles both ways a random test can end gracefully
- Maintains test coverage of the battle scene
- Follows the engine's design where `_QuitWholeGame` is an expected exception during graceful shutdown

The test will now pass while still verifying the battle scene's functionality through random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs during random testing.

The test is entering an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene until it hits quit, but we're not catching the quit exception. According to the engine architecture, we should catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions during testing.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: f3531a28-b40e-477a-b66f-f6a2325733d2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "Scene did not transition or quit"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Simplified the assertion to just check if transition was called
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains the engine architecture while properly handling all possible ways the scene can end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with an empty list of choices. Looking at the logs, this happens after a creature is knocked out. The issue is in MainGameScene's get_player_action method - when trying to swap creatures, if all creatures are knocked out except the active one, the available_creatures list becomes empty.

We need to:
1. Add proper checks in get_player_action to prevent offering "Swap" when there are no valid creatures to swap to
2. Handle the case where a creature is knocked out and there are no valid creatures to swap to
3. Keep all the model definitions pure data schemas
4. Stay within engine capabilities using only _wait_for_choice, _show_text, and _transition_to_scene

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added validation in get_player_action to only offer valid choices
2. Added None return from get_player_action when no valid choices exist
3. Added handle_no_valid_actions method to handle game end when a player has no valid moves
4. Updated run() to check for None returns from get_player_action
5. Kept all model definitions unchanged
6. Used only engine-provided methods (_wait_for_choice, _show_text, _transition_to_scene)

This should fix the test failures while maintaining the architectural integrity of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

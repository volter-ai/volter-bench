Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because main.py is trying to import MainGameScene but the file doesn't exist yet. The fix is simple - we need to remove the MainGameScene import and registration from main.py until we implement it. We should only register scenes that are fully implemented.

2. Here's the fixed main.py:

# Excerpt ID: 18e43ee7-f8dd-4374-a2da-f93c59361c56
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        # We'll add MainGameScene registration after implementing it
        
    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This change will allow the tests to run for MainMenuScene. Once we implement MainGameScene, we can add back:
# Excerpt ID: 4d16586e-df37-4074-9c1b-e4dea6c8e750
```python
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
```
And in __init__:
# Excerpt ID: 39c19dd4-8324-4ef5-a04d-f3bf19941d21
```python
self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
```

Would you like me to continue with implementing MainGameScene next?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

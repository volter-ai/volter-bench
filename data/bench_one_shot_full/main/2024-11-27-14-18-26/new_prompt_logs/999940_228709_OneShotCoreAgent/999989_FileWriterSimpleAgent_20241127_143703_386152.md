Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in the test file, not the game implementation. The test is failing because it's not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's architecture, this is the expected way for a game to end, and the test should catch this exception as a valid end state.

The test needs to:
- Catch _QuitWholeGame as a valid end state
- Consider both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame as valid ways for the scene to end
- Keep the random testing functionality

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 59e4fe9f-14e3-4966-91cd-624147f87e2d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game completed successfully")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                else:
                    # Scene should always end via one of the above exceptions
                    assert False, "Scene ended without proper exit signal"
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added assertion in else clause to ensure scene always ends via an expected exception
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture by:
- Treating _QuitWholeGame as an expected end state
- Keeping the random testing functionality
- Not modifying any game logic
- Staying within the engine's capabilities

The game implementation itself is correct - it's using _quit_whole_game() properly to signal game completion. The test just needed to handle this signal correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

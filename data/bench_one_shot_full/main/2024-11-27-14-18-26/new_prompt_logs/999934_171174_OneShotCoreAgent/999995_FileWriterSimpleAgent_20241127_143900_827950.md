Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that the test is failing because it can't find `main_game.scenes.main_game_scene`. This is because we referenced MainGameScene in main.py but haven't created the file yet. We need to implement the main_game_scene.py file with the battle logic.

2. Solution:
I'll create the main_game_scene.py file implementing the battle mechanics as described in the docs. The scene will:
- Handle turn-based combat between player and bot
- Manage creature swapping
- Calculate damage based on type effectiveness
- Track creature HP and handle knockouts

This implementation:
1. Follows the scene architecture by using the engine's choice system
2. Uses the models as pure data schemas
3. Implements all battle mechanics from the docs
4. Properly handles creature swapping and knockouts
5. Calculates damage according to the formulas
6. Uses type effectiveness as specified
7. Resets creature state before leaving

The scene should now work with the existing main.py and test files.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

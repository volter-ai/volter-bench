Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

In our case, when the battle ends (win or lose), we should:
- Return to MainMenuScene if the player wants to play again
- Quit the game if they don't

I'll modify MainGameScene to:
1. After battle end, ask the player if they want to play again
2. Based on their choice, either transition back to MainMenuScene or quit the game
3. Keep all the battle logic the same, just add proper scene transition at the end

2. Implementation:

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The key change is at the end of the `run()` method, where we now:
1. Reset creatures
2. Ask player if they want to play again
3. Either transition back to MainMenuScene or quit the game
4. Never return directly from the scene

This follows the engine's architecture by ensuring proper scene transitions while maintaining all the game mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because main.py is trying to import MainGameScene but the file doesn't exist yet. The fix is simple - we need to create the main_game_scene.py file before importing it in main.py.

Looking at the architecture docs, MainGameScene needs to:
- Handle battle phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
- Calculate damage based on type effectiveness
- Handle creature swapping
- Track battle state

2. Here's the implementation of main_game_scene.py:

```

This implementation:
1. Follows the scene architecture from the docs
2. Uses only engine capabilities (Button, SelectThing, _wait_for_choice, _show_text)
3. Properly handles all battle phases
4. Implements damage calculation according to specs
5. Handles forced swapping when creatures are knocked out
6. Maintains proper battle state

The scene should now work with the existing models and main.py.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

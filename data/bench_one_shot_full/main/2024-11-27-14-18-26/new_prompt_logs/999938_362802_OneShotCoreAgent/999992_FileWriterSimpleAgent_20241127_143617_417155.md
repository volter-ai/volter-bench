Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene's run() method is returning directly when the battle ends, instead of properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- _transition_to_scene() to go to another scene
- _quit_whole_game() to end the game

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the scene by calling _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends, since this is the final scene in our game.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper scene termination by calling `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends
2. Added checks for battle end after each potential null action return
3. Maintained the scene's game loop integrity by using continue when actions are null but battle hasn't ended

This ensures the scene always ends properly according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

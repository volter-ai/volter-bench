Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in main_game_scene.py with the DictionaryChoice usage. The error occurs because we're calling .value() as a function but it's a dict property. Looking at the engine code, DictionaryChoice is meant to store a dictionary value, not call it as a function.

The fix is to properly construct the DictionaryChoice by passing the dictionary in the constructor rather than trying to call .value as a method. This matches how DictionaryChoice is meant to be used in the engine.

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: f3909516-3769-42fa-a5eb-e39f2d5a16e9

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Fixed DictionaryChoice construction to use the constructor properly
2. Added .value when accessing the action dictionaries in resolve_actions()
3. Kept all other game logic the same since it was working correctly

This should resolve the TypeError while maintaining the engine's architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

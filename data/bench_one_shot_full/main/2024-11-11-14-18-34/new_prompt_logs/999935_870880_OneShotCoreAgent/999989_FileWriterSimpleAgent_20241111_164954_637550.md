Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that MainGameScene is breaking from its game loop when the battle ends, instead of properly transitioning back to MainMenuScene or calling quit_whole_game. According to the engine's architecture, scenes must always end by explicitly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

I'll fix this by:
1. Modifying check_battle_end() to return a boolean indicating who won
2. Using that result to either transition back to MainMenuScene or quit_whole_game
3. Not modifying any models since they should remain pure data schemas
4. Staying within the engine's scene transition capabilities

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return None  # Battle continues
```

Key changes:
1. Modified check_battle_end to return True for player win, False for player loss, None for battle continues
2. Added proper scene transition logic after battle ends
3. Added "Play Again" or "Quit" choice after battle
4. Properly transitions to MainMenuScene or quits game based on player choice
5. No changes needed to models or other files
6. Stays within engine capabilities by using proper scene transitions

This should fix the test failure while maintaining the proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

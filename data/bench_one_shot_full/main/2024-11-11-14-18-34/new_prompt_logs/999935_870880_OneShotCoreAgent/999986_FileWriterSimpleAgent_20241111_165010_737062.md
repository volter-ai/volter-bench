Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's architecture, this exception is expected and should be caught, as indicated by the error message.

The test needs to:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
2. Not modify any models since they should remain pure data schemas
3. Stay within engine capabilities
4. Handle both normal game end and random mode end cases

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: bc485523-cf63-4b74-82bf-928e4fe753ae
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game ended gracefully via quit")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added try/except block to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch for unexpected exceptions that fails the test
4. Added print statements to help with debugging
5. No changes needed to models or other files
6. Stays within engine capabilities by properly handling expected exceptions

This should fix the test failure while maintaining the proper architecture. The test now properly handles both ways the game can end:
- When random mode counter reaches 0
- When the game ends naturally and calls quit_whole_game

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since active_creature is meant to be optional (it starts as None and gets set during battle), we need to mark it as Optional in the model.

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Import Optional from typing in models.py
2. Change the active_creature field in Player to be Optional[Creature]
3. This tells the validation system that None is an acceptable value

Here's the complete fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 0301741c-001c-4ed4-a2bc-599377ac3b32
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change:
1. Follows the model guidelines by keeping models as pure data schemas
2. Properly inherits from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
3. Uses the engine's validation system correctly by marking optional fields
4. Maintains the architecture where game logic stays in scenes
5. Allows the JSON data to omit the active_creature field since it's optional

The tests should now pass since the validation error for missing active_creature will no longer occur.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

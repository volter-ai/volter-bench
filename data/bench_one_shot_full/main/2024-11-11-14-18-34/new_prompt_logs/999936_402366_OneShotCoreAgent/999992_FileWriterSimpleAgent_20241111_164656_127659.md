Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in main_game_scene.py where we're trying to access bot_action[0] when bot_action could be None. This happens because get_player_action() can return None (when the player chooses "Back"), but resolve_actions() doesn't handle this case.

The fix should:
1. Ensure both actions are valid before resolving them
2. Handle the case where either player chooses to go back
3. Keep the scene running until valid actions are chosen
4. Maintain the pure data model architecture

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added an inner loop in run() to ensure we have valid actions from both players before proceeding
2. Added null checks in resolve_actions() when accessing actions
3. Maintained the pure data model architecture by keeping all game logic in the scene
4. Kept the same interface for models and engine integration

This should resolve the NoneType errors while maintaining the game's architecture and functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that is required but not provided in the JSON data. Since this is a pure data model, we need to handle this at the data level rather than setting it programmatically.

The solution is to:
1. Make `active_creature` optional in the Player model by using `Field(default=None)`
2. Keep the type hint as `Creature | None` to maintain type safety
3. This matches the architecture where models are pure data schemas and follows the engine's capabilities

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 5bb4785b-a635-40c9-80ae-355b5c9d0ef0
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

This solution:
1. Maintains the pure data schema nature of models.py
2. Uses the engine's Field system to properly handle optional values
3. Keeps type safety with the Union type hint
4. Allows the active_creature to be initialized as None and set later in the scene logic
5. Follows the pattern of using Field for default values rather than adding methods

The error will be resolved because the validation system will now accept a missing active_creature field in the JSON data, while still maintaining type safety when the field is accessed.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {

        },

                "creature_type": "water"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {

                      "is_physical": true
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",

                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  },
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 5

                    "entities": {},

                  }

              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",

    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (prominent)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative
     - Bottom: Button controls

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Using Tailwind classes for:
     - Flexbox layout (`flex`, `flex-col`)
     - Positioning (`justify-center`, `items-center`)
     - Spacing (`gap-y-8`, `p-8`)
     - Typography (`text-4xl`, `font-bold`)
   - Maintaining 16:9 ratio using aspect-ratio utilities
   - Responsive design considerations

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with background styling
   - Title section with game name
   - Button section with dynamic button rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`
   - Using Lucide icons for visual enhancement

4. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Button clicks managed through `emitButtonClick`
   - Conditional rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`
   - Safe handling of missing data

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Play, XCircle} from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: Player;
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-800 to-slate-900 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
            <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                    CREATURE BATTLE
                </h1>
            </div>

            <div className="flex flex-col gap-y-4 items-center mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('play') && (
                    <button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="flex items-center gap-x-2 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white px-8 py-4 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold transition-colors"
                    >
                        <Play className="w-6 h-6" />
                        Play Game
                    </button>
                )}

                {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('quit') && (
                    <button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        className="flex items-center gap-x-2 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white px-8 py-4 rounded-lg text-xl font-semibold transition-colors"
                    >
                        <XCircle className="w-6 h-6" />
                        Quit
                    </button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    )
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen container with a dark gradient background
- Centers the title "CREATURE BATTLE" in the upper portion
- Places action buttons in the bottom section
- Uses Lucide icons for visual enhancement
- Implements responsive design with Tailwind
- Handles button availability through `availableButtonSlugs`
- Uses a clean, modern gaming UI aesthetic
- Maintains 16:9 aspect ratio
- Includes hover effects and transitions for interactivity
- Safely handles potential missing data
- Uses semantic HTML structure

The buttons are styled with distinct colors (green for play, red for quit) and include icons for better visual hierarchy. The layout is flexible and will maintain its structure across different screen sizes while keeping the 16:9 aspect ratio.

            </div>
        </Card>
    )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added proper interfaces matching the VIEW_DATA structure
2. Included shadcn/ui components (Button and Card)
3. Made sure all interfaces include required uid property
4. Used proper Button variants and sizes from shadcn
5. Added safe access to props.data for display_name
6. Maintained the 16:9 aspect ratio and full-screen layout
7. Kept the clean visual hierarchy and responsive design
8. Properly typed all interfaces based on the provided data structure

The component now follows all the guidelines while maintaining the same visual structure and functionality.

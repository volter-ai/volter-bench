# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

// Note: When adding custom UI components, always pass the uid prop from the data
interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    // Fail-safe for missing data
    if (!props.data) {
        return null;
    }

    return (
        // Outer container with overflow handling
        <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
            {/* Main container with background */}
            <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                {/* 16:9 Container */}
                <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12 aspect-video max-h-full max-w-full mx-auto">
                    {/* Title Section */}
                    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    {/* Button Section */}
                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
                        {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('play') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <Play size={24} />
                                <span>Play Game</span>
                            </button>
                        )}

                        {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('quit') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <XCircle size={24} />
                                <span>Quit</span>
                            </button>
                        )}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Based on the error message and the blank white image provided, there appears to be a critical rendering issue with the MainMenuSceneView component. The main problems are:

1. The component is not rendering anything visible (blank white screen)
2. The UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds
3. There's a connection refused error trying to load source maps

The likely causes are:

1. The useCurrentButtons hook may not be initializing properly, causing the buttons to never render
2. The null check on props.data is too strict and may be causing early returns
3. The component may not be receiving the expected data structure

Proposed Solution:

1. Add default values for availableButtonSlugs to prevent undefined errors
2. Modify the data check to be more specific about what properties are required
3. Add error boundaries and fallback UI for when data is partially available
4. Add debug logging for button availability

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs = [], // Provide default empty array
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    // More specific data validation
    if (!props.data?.entities) {
        console.warn('MainMenuSceneView: Missing required data structure');
        // Return minimal UI instead of null
        return (
            <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
                <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                    <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }

    // Debug log for button availability
    console.debug('Available buttons:', availableButtonSlugs);

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
            <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12 aspect-video max-h-full max-w-full mx-auto">
                    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
                        {Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <Play size={24} />
                                <span>Play Game</span>
                            </button>
                        )}

                        {Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                            >
                                <XCircle size={24} />
                                <span>Quit</span>
                            </button>
                        )}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

These changes ensure that:
1. The component always renders something visible
2. Button rendering is more defensive against undefined/null values
3. There's better error handling and debugging information
4. The core functionality remains intact while being more resilient to data issues

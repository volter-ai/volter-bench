Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs = [], // Provide default empty array
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    // More specific data validation
    if (!props.data?.entities) {
        console.warn('MainMenuSceneView: Missing required data structure');
        // Return minimal UI instead of null
        return (
            <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden">
                <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                    <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">

                        </h1>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }

    // Debug log for button availability
    console.debug('Available buttons:', availableButtonSlugs);

                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8">
                        {Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"

                            </button>
                        )}

                        {Array.isArray(availableButtonSlugs) && availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                            <button

                                <span>Quit</span>
                            </button>
                        )}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: From the error message and the image, I can identify several issues:

1. The main issue appears to be a timeout error, suggesting that the UI simulator couldn't interact with the buttons properly within the 120-second window.

2. Looking at the code and error, there seems to be an issue with the useCurrentButtons hook not properly initializing or receiving button data, leading to ERROR-001 where the choices list is empty.

3. The emitButtonClick function might not be properly handling the button clicks, causing the simulator to fail to register interactions.

Proposed Solution:

1. Add error handling and default values for the useCurrentButtons hook return values
2. Add proper type checking for the emitButtonClick function
3. Ensure buttons are properly accessible and clickable by adding proper ARIA roles
4. Add data-testid attributes to help with testing
5. Improve button visibility and interaction states

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs = [], // Provide default empty array
        emitButtonClick = (slug: string) => console.warn(`Button click not handled: ${slug}`)
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    // More specific data validation
    if (!props.data?.entities) {
        console.warn('MainMenuSceneView: Missing required data structure');
        return (
            <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden" data-testid="main-menu-fallback">
                <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                    <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }

    const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
        if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug)) {
            emitButtonClick(slug);
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full overflow-hidden" data-testid="main-menu-scene">
            <div className="w-full h-full relative bg-slate-900">
                <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between py-12 aspect-video max-h-full max-w-full mx-auto">
                    <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                            GAME TITLE
                        </h1>
                    </div>

                    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-8" data-testid="menu-buttons">
                        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                                role="button"
                                data-testid="play-button"
                                aria-label="Play Game"
                            >
                                <Play size={24} />
                                <span>Play Game</span>
                            </button>
                        )}

                        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                            <button
                                onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
                                className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
                                role="button"
                                data-testid="quit-button"
                                aria-label="Quit Game"
                            >
                                <XCircle size={24} />
                                <span>Quit</span>
                            </button>
                        )}
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Key changes made:

1. Added default function for emitButtonClick to prevent undefined errors
2. Created handleButtonClick function to validate slugs before emission
3. Removed redundant Array.isArray checks since we provide a default array
4. Added data-testid attributes for better testing capabilities
5. Added proper ARIA roles and labels for accessibility
6. Improved error handling and validation
7. Added proper button interaction states

These changes should resolve the timeout issues by ensuring the buttons are properly initialized, accessible, and interactive for the UI simulator to detect and interact with them.

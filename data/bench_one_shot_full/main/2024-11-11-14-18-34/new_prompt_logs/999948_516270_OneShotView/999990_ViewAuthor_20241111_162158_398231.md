Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-lick
	-tackle

Content: I'll help design and implement this component. Let me outline the architecture first:

1. **Layout Structure**
- Main container: Full-width, 16:9 aspect ratio using Tailwind's `aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9`
- Two main sections: 
  - Battlefield (upper 2/3): `h-2/3`
  - UI Area (lower 1/3): `h-1/3`

2. **Battlefield Components**
- Grid layout using `grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2`
- Four quadrants for:
  - Player creature (bottom-left)
  - Player status (bottom-right)
  - Opponent creature (top-right)
  - Opponent status (top-left)

3. **Health Bar Component**
- Custom component for HP display
- Uses relative width based on current/max HP
- Gradient background for visual appeal

4. **Button Grid**
- 2x2 grid layout for action buttons
- Filtered based on `availableButtonSlugs`
- Responsive sizing

5. **TypeScript Interfaces**
We'll need interfaces for:
- Creature (stats, meta, skills)
- Skill (stats, meta)
- Status display data

6. **Styling Strategy**
Using Tailwind classes for:
- Responsive layout
- Flexbox/Grid positioning
- Color schemes
- Transitions/animations
- Shadow effects for creatures

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  if (!playerCreature || !opponentCreature) return null;

  return (

                </button>
              )
            ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

}
```

This implementation:
- Uses a responsive layout that maintains 16:9 aspect ratio
- Implements all required sections with proper positioning
- Includes health bars and status displays
- Shows available skills as buttons in a 2x2 grid
- Uses Tailwind for styling
- Includes proper TypeScript typing
- Has null checks for safety
- Uses Lucide icons for stats display
- Implements shadow effects for creatures
- Uses gradient backgrounds for visual appeal

The component is ready to receive game data and display it appropriately while maintaining all the required functionality from the specification.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

  "explanation": "The code needs some adjustments:\n\n1. We didn't follow the guideline about using existing shadcn components - we created custom components like HealthBar when we should use existing UI components.\n\n2. The GameUIData interface in the original boilerplate had a specific structure we should maintain, with entities containing a player object. We modified it incorrectly.\n\n3. We should ensure all components from shadcn/ui receive a uid prop for tracking purposes.\n\n4. The styling looks good with Tailwind, but we should probably use more shadcn/ui components for consistency.\n\n5. The button implementation should probably use shadcn/ui Button component instead of raw HTML buttons.\n\nThese issues should be addressed before using the code.",

```

Key changes made:
1. Added proper shadcn components (Card, Button, Progress)
2. Added uid props to all shadcn components
3. Corrected GameUIData interface to match the original structure
4. Removed custom HealthBar in favor of shadcn Progress
5. Maintained all the required layout and styling
6. Kept proper TypeScript typing and null checks
7. Maintained the button functionality with availableButtonSlugs

The code now properly follows all guidelines while maintaining the required functionality and layout structure.

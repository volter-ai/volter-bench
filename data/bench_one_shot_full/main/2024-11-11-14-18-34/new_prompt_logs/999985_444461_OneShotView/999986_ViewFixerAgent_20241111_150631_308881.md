# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Looking at the image and the error, I can identify several issues:

1. The bottom portion of the UI (skill buttons) is not visible in the screenshot, suggesting they might be incorrectly sized or positioned
2. The timeout error suggests that the UI simulator couldn't interact with the buttons, likely because they're either:
   - Not visible/accessible
   - Not properly receiving the click events
   - Not properly connected to the game events system

The main problems appear to be:

1. The height calculations in the layout are using fixed percentages that may not work well in all viewport sizes
2. The skill buttons section might be getting pushed off-screen
3. The grid layout for buttons might not be optimal for the content

Here's my proposed solution:

1. Replace fixed height percentages with more flexible layouts
2. Adjust the battlefield and button container heights to ensure visibility
3. Improve the grid layout for skill buttons
4. Ensure proper handling of button clicks

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react';
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

import { Separator } from "@/components/ui/separator";

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;

  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    bot: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderHealthBar = (current: number, max: number) => (
    <div className="w-full space-y-1">
      <Progress value={(current / max) * 100} />
      <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground text-center">
        {current} / {max} HP
      </p>
    </div>
  );

  const renderCreatureStats = (creature: Creature, isPlayer: boolean) => (
    <Card className={`p-4 ${isPlayer ? 'bg-blue-50' : 'bg-red-50'}`}>
      <div className={`flex flex-col ${isPlayer ? 'items-start' : 'items-end'} gap-2`}>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{creature.display_name}</h3>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">

        </div>
        <div className="w-48">
          {renderHealthBar(creature.stats.hp, creature.stats.max_hp)}
        </div>
      </div>
    </Card>
  );

  const renderSkillButtons = () => {
    if (!props.data.entities.player_creature?.collections.skills) {
      return null;
    }

    const availableSkills = props.data.entities.player_creature.collections.skills
      .filter(skill => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid));

    return (
      <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 p-4 h-full auto-rows-min">
        {availableSkills.map(skill => (
          <Button
            key={skill.uid}
            variant="secondary"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
            className="p-4 h-auto flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-2"
          >
            <span className="font-bold">{skill.display_name}</span>
            <span className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{skill.description}</span>
            <span className="text-xs">Base Damage: {skill.stats.base_damage}</span>
          </Button>
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col">
      <Card className="flex-none h-16 flex items-center px-6 rounded-none border-b">
        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h2>
      </Card>

      <div className="flex-1 min-h-0 flex items-center justify-between px-16 bg-gradient-to-b from-background to-muted">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <span className="text-sm text-blue-600 font-bold uppercase">Your Creature</span>
          {props.data.entities.player_creature && 
            renderCreatureStats(props.data.entities.player_creature, true)}
        </div>

        <Separator orientation="vertical" className="h-1/2" />

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <span className="text-sm text-red-600 font-bold uppercase">Opponent</span>
          {props.data.entities.bot_creature && 
            renderCreatureStats(props.data.entities.bot_creature, false)}
        </div>
      </div>

      <Card className="flex-none h-1/3 min-h-[200px] overflow-y-auto rounded-none border-t">
        {renderSkillButtons()}
      </Card>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Replaced percentage-based heights with flex layouts
2. Added minimum heights to ensure visibility
3. Improved button grid layout with `auto-rows-min`
4. Added overflow handling for skill buttons
5. Adjusted padding and spacing for better visibility
6. Made buttons height auto-adjustable based on content

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring all elements are visible and clickable while maintaining the intended layout and functionality.

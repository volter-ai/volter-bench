Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

interface SkillButtonProps {
  uid: string
  name: string
  description: string
  stats: string
  onClick?: () => void
  disabled?: boolean
}

let SkillButton = ({
  uid,
  name,
  description,
  stats,
  onClick,
  disabled
}: SkillButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <HoverCard uid={`${uid}-hover`}>
      <HoverCardTrigger uid={`${uid}-trigger`} asChild>
        <Button
          uid={`${uid}-button`}
          variant="default"
          onClick={onClick}
          disabled={disabled}
          className="w-[200px]"
        >
          {name}
        </Button>
      </HoverCardTrigger>
      <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-content`} className="w-80">
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h4 className="text-sm font-semibold">{name}</h4>
          <p className="text-sm">{description}</p>
          <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
            {stats}
          </div>
        </div>
      </HoverCardContent>
    </HoverCard>
  )
}

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardContent,
} from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Card> {
  uid: string
  name: string
  imageUrl: string
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-[300px]", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
        <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
        <img
          src={imageUrl}
          alt={name}
          className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`

interface CreatureCardProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  uid: string

  hp: number
  maxHp: number
  imageUrl: string
}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, hp, maxHp, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <Card uid={`${uid}-card`} ref={ref} className={cn("w-[350px]", className)} {...props}>
        <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
          <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription uid={`${uid}-description`}>HP: {hp}/{maxHp}</CardDescription>

            alt={name}
            className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
          />
        </CardContent>
        <CardFooter uid={`${uid}-footer`} className="flex justify-between">
        </CardFooter>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.

Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Main container (full viewport, 16:9 ratio)
   - HUD navbar (top)
   - Battlefield (middle section)
   - UI region (bottom section)

2. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container using flex-col layout
   - Battlefield using flex-row for horizontal creature placement
   - Bottom UI section with conditional rendering between text and buttons

3. **Tailwind Styling Approach**:
   - Use `h-screen` and `aspect-[16/9]` for container
   - Flex layouts: `flex flex-col` for vertical stacking
   - Grid system for skill buttons: `grid grid-cols-3 gap-4`
   - Responsive spacing with relative units
   - Custom positioning using `justify-between` and `items-center`

4. **Data Handling**:
   - Create interfaces for Creature, Player, and Skill types
   - Use optional chaining for safe data access
   - Implement null checks for conditional rendering

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    bot: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-full aspect-[16/9] flex flex-col bg-background">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="w-full p-4 bg-secondary/10 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">

          <span>Battle Scene</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Shield className="h-5 w-5" />

        {playerCreature && (

              name={playerCreature.display_name}
              hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder.png"
            />
          </div>
        )}

        {botCreature && (
          <div className="relative">

              maxHp={botCreature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder.png"
            />
          </div>

This implementation:
- Uses a full-screen 16:9 container
- Implements all three main sections (HUD, Battlefield, UI)
- Uses the custom components as specified
- Handles missing data safely
- Uses Tailwind for responsive layouts
- Maintains proper typing for all data structures
- Uses Lucide icons for visual enhancement

The layout is responsive and maintains the proper aspect ratio while filling the available space. The battlefield clearly shows both creatures with their respective status, and the bottom UI region displays the available skills as buttons.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

SkillButton:\n- \u2713 Correctly passes uid from skill.uid\n- \u2713 Passes required props (name, description, stats)\n- \u2713 Correctly handles disabled state based on availableButtonSlugs\n\n3. PlayerCard:\n- \u274c Not used but might be needed for player entities\n- Should show player information in the HUD\n\nAdditional Issues:\n- Should handle the case where creatures or skills arrays are undefined/null\n- Should use optional chaining for deeper nested properties\n- Missing error states or loading states\n- PlayerCard component should be used to show player information\n\nThe code needs revision to:\n1. Add proper null checks\n2. Include PlayerCard usage\n3. Add proper error/loading states\n4. Use optional chaining consistently\n5. Remove hardcoded image URLs",

Changes made:
1. Added proper null checks and loading state
2. Included PlayerCard components in the HUD
3. Added proper optional chaining for all nested properties
4. Changed image URLs to be dynamic based on entity UIDs
5. Added fallback content when skills are not available
6. Added proper destructuring with default empty object
7. Added Loader2 icon for loading state
8. Improved error handling with null coalescing operators
9. Maintained consistent UID passing for all custom components
10. Added proper type safety throughout the component

This version should be much more robust and handle edge cases better while still maintaining the required layout and functionality.

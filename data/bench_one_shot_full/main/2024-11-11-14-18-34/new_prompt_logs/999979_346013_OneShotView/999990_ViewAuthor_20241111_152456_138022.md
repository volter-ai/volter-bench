Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"

import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"

          </Button>
        </HoverCardTrigger>
        <HoverCardContent uid={uid}>
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <h4 className="font-medium leading-none">{name}</h4>

          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Use a flex container for the full viewport (h-screen w-screen)
- Divide into three main sections vertically:
  * Top: HUD/Navigation bar (1/8 height)
  * Middle: Battlefield (1/2 height)
  * Bottom: UI/Controls area (3/8 height)

2. Battlefield Design:
- Horizontal flex container with justify-between
- Left side: Player creature with CreatureCard
- Right side: Opponent creature with CreatureCard
- Use transform/translate for positioning adjustments

3. UI/Controls Area:
- Flex container for skills/buttons
- Grid layout for skill buttons when displayed
- Use SkillButton components for each skill

4. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for safe data access
- Implement null checks for collections

5. Styling Strategy:
- Use Tailwind classes for layout and positioning
- Implement responsive design with flex/grid
- Use shadcn components for consistent UI elements

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    base_damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
    attack: number
    defense: number
    speed: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    bot_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature

  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen flex flex-col">

        />
        <PlayerCard 
          uid={props.data.entities.bot.uid}
          name={props.data.entities.bot.display_name}

This implementation:
1. Creates proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Uses the custom components as specified
3. Implements a full-screen layout with proper proportions
4. Handles null/undefined cases safely
5. Uses Tailwind for styling and layout
6. Positions creatures on opposite sides with slight vertical offset for visual interest
7. Implements the skills area in the bottom section
8. Uses the HUD area to show player information

The component assumes the existence of creature images in a `/creatures/` directory and player images in the root directory. You'll need to ensure these assets exist or modify the image paths accordingly.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

PlayerCard:\n\u2713 uid prop is correctly passed from player.uid\n\u2717 However, we're using hardcoded imageUrl which isn't in the data model\n\n2. CreatureCard:\n\u2713 uid prop is correctly passed from creature.uid\n\u2717 We're using meta.prototype_id which wasn't defined in our interface\n\u2717 Using template literals for imageUrl when we don't have that data structure\n\n3. SkillButton:\n\u2713 uid prop is correctly passed from skill.uid\n\u2713 All other required props are correctly passed\n\nOther issues:\n- We're using hardcoded classes like \"h-1/8\" which isn't a valid Tailwind class (should be something like \"h-[12.5%]\")\n- The interface for GameUIData doesn't match the example data structure (missing meta, stats, etc.)\n- We should handle the case where skills array might be empty\n- We should check if availableButtonSlugs is being used properly\n\nThe code needs revision to:\n1. Remove hardcoded image paths\n2. Fix Tailwind classes\n3. Complete the interfaces to match the data\n4. Add proper null checks\n5. Handle empty states",

Changes made:
1. Fixed interfaces to match the full data structure
2. Removed hardcoded image paths in favor of API endpoints that would serve the images
3. Added proper height classes using percentage values
4. Added null checks for main entities with loading state
5. Added empty state for when no skills are available
6. Added filtering of skills based on availableButtonSlugs
7. Properly structured the layout with correct proportions
8. Ensured all custom components receive their required uid props
9. Added proper type safety throughout
10. Maintained the visual layout while improving the implementation

The code now better reflects the data structure shown in the example and handles edge cases more gracefully. All custom components receive their required props, and the layout maintains the desired proportions while being more robust.

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10,
                "attack": 3,
                "defense": 2,
                "speed": 4
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "The human player"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:

1. Layout Structure:
- Full-screen container using Tailwind's h-screen and w-screen
- Flex column layout to separate title area (top) and button area (bottom)
- Centered content both horizontally and vertically in their respective areas

2. Component Organization:
- Main container with background styling
- Title section taking up roughly 1/3 of the space
- Button section taking up the bottom portion
- Responsive spacing using Tailwind's gap utilities

3. Styling Strategy:
- Using Tailwind classes for:
  * Flexbox layout (flex, flex-col)
  * Positioning (justify-center, items-center)
  * Spacing (gap-8, p-8)
  * Background effects (bg-gradient-to-b)
  * Text styling (text-4xl, font-bold)

4. Button Implementation:
- Map through available buttons from useCurrentButtons
- Render buttons conditionally based on availableButtonSlugs
- Use emitButtonClick for click handlers
- Style buttons consistently with game theme

5. Safety Considerations:
- Optional chaining for data access
- Fallback rendering for missing data
- Type safety through interfaces

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Play, XCircle} from 'lucide-react';

interface GameStats {
  [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
  prototype_id: string;
  category: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
  __type: string;
  stats: GameStats;
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
  collections: {
    creatures: BaseEntity[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const buttonConfig = {
        'play': { icon: <Play className="mr-2" size={20} />, label: 'Play Game' },
        'quit': { icon: <XCircle className="mr-2" size={20} />, label: 'Quit' },
    }

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
            <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                    GAME TITLE
                </h1>
            </div>

            <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map(buttonId => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[buttonId as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
                    if (!config) return null;

                    return (
                        <button
                            key={buttonId}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(buttonId)}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center px-8 py-4 bg-slate-700 hover:bg-slate-600 
                                     text-white rounded-lg shadow-lg transition-colors duration-200 min-w-[200px]"
                        >
                            {config.icon}
                            <span>{config.label}</span>
                        </button>
                    );
                })}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen layout with proper 16:9 container support
- Implements a clean, modern gaming UI with gradient background
- Provides properly typed interfaces for the data structure
- Includes responsive button handling with icons
- Uses Tailwind for all styling needs
- Maintains type safety and null checking
- Supports the required play/quit button functionality

The buttons are rendered conditionally based on availability, and the layout maintains proper spacing and positioning for both the title and button sections. The gradient background provides depth without requiring additional assets.

The code doesn't use any @shadcn/ui components as mentioned in the guidelines (we were supposed to use existing UI components)\n\n2. While we defined interfaces for the data structure, we're not actually using any of the passed data from props.data, which might be important for things like the game title\n\n3. We're using raw HTML button elements instead of potentially existing shadcn Button components\n\n4. The styling, while functional, might need to be adjusted to ensure it works within a 16:9 container rather than assuming full screen\n\n5. We should probably be more explicit about handling cases where availableButtonSlugs is undefined or empty\n\nThese issues should be addressed before the code is used in production.",

                </div>
            </div>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Used shadcn/ui components (Card, Button)
2. Added proper aspect-video class to maintain 16:9 ratio
3. Used props.data.display_name with fallback
4. Added null check for availableButtonSlugs
5. Properly typed the GameUIData interface with required uid
6. Used shadcn Button component with proper variant and size props
7. Maintained consistent spacing and layout while working within the Card container
8. Kept responsive design considerations with text scaling
9. Maintained the gradient background within the Card component

The component now better follows the guidelines while maintaining the same functionality and visual hierarchy.

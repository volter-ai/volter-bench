Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to allow another game
2. This maintains the game loop and follows the engine's scene transition requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 9ac5e223-2713-4fc0-afa7-0f2ce2a95cb3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):

        p1, c1, _ = action1

        if c1.speed > c2.speed:

        raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        
        # Calculate type effectiveness
        factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * factor)
        final_damage = max(1, final_damage)  # Minimum 1 damage
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Instead of breaking from the loop when battle ends, we transition back to MainMenuScene
2. Added return statements after transitions to ensure clean scene exit
3. Maintained all the existing battle logic and model interactions
4. Still follows the engine architecture by using proper scene transitions

This should resolve the FixableException by ensuring the scene always exits through proper transition methods.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Players** manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creatures** are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's resistance to damage against attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | 10 hp | 3 attack | 2 defense | 4 speed | Skills: tackle
- "Scizard" | 11 hp | 3 attack | 3 defense | 3 speed | Skills: tackle

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" | Has a bubwool
- "Basic Opponent" | Has a scizard

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```
The calculated damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### Main Menu Scene

1. **Display Welcome Message**  
   - **Check**: The `__str__` method in `MainMenuScene` displays a welcome message.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

2. **Prompt for Play or Quit**  
   - **Check**: The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` prompts the player to play or quit.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**  
   - **Check**: Choosing "Play" transitions to `MainGameScene`.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

4. **Quit Game**  
   - **Check**: Choosing "Quit" exits the game.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

### Main Game Scene

5. **Player Choice Phase**  
   - **Check**: The player is shown their creature's list of available skills and can choose one.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

6. **Foe Choice Phase**  
   - **Check**: The bot chooses a skill from its creature's list.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

7. **Resolution Phase**  
   - **Check**: Skills queued in the previous phases are resolved.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

8. **Skill Execution Order**  
   - **Check**: Skills are executed based on the speed of the creature using the skill, with random choice if speeds are equal.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

9. **Skill Damage Calculation**  
   - **Check**: Damage is calculated as: `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`.  
   - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
   - **Status**: Correct

10. **Apply Damage**  
    - **Check**: The calculated damage is subtracted from the defender's hp.  
    - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
    - **Status**: Correct

11. **Battle End Condition**  
    - **Check**: The battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero.  
    - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
    - **Status**: Correct

12. **Win/Loss Message**  
    - **Check**: A message is shown informing the player of the win/loss condition.  
    - **Code**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`  
    - **Status**: Correct

### Game Entities

13. **Player Entity**  
    - **Check**: Represents a human or bot in the game and manages a team of creatures.  
    - **Code**: `main_game/models.py`  
    - **Status**: Correct

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test should catch this exception since it's an expected way for the game to end.

The test is also not properly mocking the scene transitions like test_main_menu_scene.py does. We should follow the same pattern of mocking transitions to properly test the MainGameScene in isolation.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: b7ee2a77-2b46-4bb6-8393-5ea9aaf95981
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Mock both scene transition and game quit
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:

1. Added proper mocking of scene transitions using the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py
2. Added handling of AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
3. Added assertions to verify the scene exits properly via transition or quit
4. Added proper cleanup of mocks between test iterations

This ensures the test properly validates the MainGameScene's behavior in isolation without getting caught in scene transition loops or unhandled quit exceptions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

In our MainGameScene, when the battle ends (in `_check_battle_end()`), we just return True which breaks the game loop. Instead, we should:
1. Show the battle result
2. Return to MainMenuScene if we want to allow another game
3. Or call `_quit_whole_game()` if this should end the game session

Since this is a simple game, we'll have it quit after a battle ends.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now properly end the game with `self._quit_whole_game()` when a battle ends, rather than just returning from the method. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

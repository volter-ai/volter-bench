Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py in the original engine code, we can see that scene tests should handle three types of exits:
1. TransitionFromScene (when moving to another scene)
2. RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves are exhausted)
3. AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame (when game ends)

We need to modify the test to catch all these cases properly.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d31d0c17-7d2b-4655-adfd-91d2ddf53343
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch the transition method to catch scene transitions
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0, ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game ended gracefully via quit_whole_game")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene did not exit in an expected manner"
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Improved logging messages to better understand how the scene exits
4. Maintained the same pattern as the engine's test_main_menu_scene.py

This allows the test to properly handle all the ways the scene can legitimately end, including when the battle ends and calls quit_whole_game().

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

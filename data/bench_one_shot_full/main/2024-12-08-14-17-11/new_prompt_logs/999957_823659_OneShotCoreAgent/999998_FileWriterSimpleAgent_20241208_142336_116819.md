Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help create this creature battler game. Let me plan out the implementation:

1. First, we need to create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (with type, damage, physical/special)
- Creature (with stats, type, skills)
- Player (with creatures)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json (containing skill prototypes)
- creature.json (containing creature prototypes) 
- player.json (containing player prototypes)

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating)
- MainGameScene (for the battle logic)

4. Create corresponding tests for each scene

Let me implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines:

1. Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
2. Models reference other models directly, not by string IDs
3. Models are ordered by dependencies
4. Scenes handle all game logic
5. Scene transitions use proper methods
6. Tests use random mode for coverage
7. Scene __str__ methods show all relevant info
8. Models are created using from_prototype_id
9. Bots are created using create_bot and treated same as players

The game implements all the required features:
- Turn-based combat system
- Physical vs Special attacks
- Type effectiveness system
- Speed-based turn order
- HP tracking and win conditions
- Bot opponent with random choices
- Main menu and battle scenes

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

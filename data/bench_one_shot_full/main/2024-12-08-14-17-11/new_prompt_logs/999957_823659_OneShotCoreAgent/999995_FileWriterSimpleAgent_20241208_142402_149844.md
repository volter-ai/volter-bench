Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to match DictionaryChoice display names with Skill display names directly. The problem is that DictionaryChoice doesn't properly carry the skill information. We need to modify how we handle choices in the battle scene.

The fix will:
1. Use DictionaryChoice properly by storing the skill index in its value
2. Simplify the skill selection logic to avoid the StopIteration error
3. Keep within engine capabilities by using proper choice handling

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        # Reset creatures to full HP
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill_choices = []
            for i, skill in enumerate(self.player_creature.skills):
                choice = DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name)
                choice.value = {"skill_index": i}
                player_skill_choices.append(choice)
            
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_choices)
            player_skill = self.player_creature.skills[player_choice.value["skill_index"]]

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill_choices = []
            for i, skill in enumerate(self.opponent_creature.skills):
                choice = DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name)
                choice.value = {"skill_index": i}
                opponent_skill_choices.append(choice)
            
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_skill_choices)
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_creature.skills[opponent_choice.value["skill_index"]]

            # Resolution phase
            self.execute_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Store skill indices in DictionaryChoice.value instead of trying to match display names
2. Simplified choice handling by using the stored indices directly
3. Created separate choice lists for player and opponent to keep the logic clear
4. Maintained the same game logic while fixing the choice mechanism

This should resolve the StopIteration error while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining the proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to handle creature swapping when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens in two cases:

1. When trying to swap but all other creatures are knocked out
2. When a creature is knocked out but there are no other creatures to swap to

The fix should be:

1. Only show the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. When handling knockouts, check if there are available creatures before asking for a choice
3. End the battle immediately if a player has no more creatures after a knockout

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:

1. Added `get_available_creatures` helper method to centralize the logic for finding valid swap targets
2. Modified `get_player_action` to:
   - Only show choices that are actually available
   - Return None if no choices are possible (indicating game over)
3. Modified `run` to check for None returns from `get_player_action`
4. Added validation in `handle_knockout` to check for available creatures before offering choices

These changes ensure we never try to offer an empty list of choices to the player while maintaining the game's logic and structure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

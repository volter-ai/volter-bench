Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the two issues:

1. Missing "Back" option in Player Choice Phase:
- When showing skills or swap choices, we'll add a "Back" button that returns to the main action menu
- We'll modify get_player_action to handle this recursive menu structure

2. Random order for equal speed:
- In resolve_turn, when speeds are equal, we'll use random.choice to pick who goes first
- This maintains the 50/50 chance specified in the docs

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

Key changes:

1. Added "Back" button functionality:
   - Modified get_player_action to use a while loop for menu navigation
   - Added Back button to both skill and creature selection menus
   - Using continue to return to main menu when Back is selected

2. Added random speed tie resolution:
   - Added explicit check for equal speeds in resolve_turn
   - Using random.choice for 50/50 chance when speeds are equal
   - Maintaining original speed comparison logic when speeds differ

These changes fully implement the requirements from the architecture documentation while maintaining the existing game structure and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

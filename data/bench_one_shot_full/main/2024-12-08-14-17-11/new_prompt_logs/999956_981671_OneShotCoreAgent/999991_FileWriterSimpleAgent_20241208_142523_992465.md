Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that the `_resolve_turn` method in MainGameScene doesn't handle speed ties randomly as specified in the documentation. According to the docs:

> If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

To fix this, I'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method to:
1. First check if speeds are equal
2. If equal, use random.choice to randomly select which creature goes first
3. If not equal, use the existing speed comparison logic

This change only requires modifying the MainGameScene class since it's purely game logic, not model logic.

2. Here's the complete fixed file:

            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are in the `_resolve_turn` method where I:
1. Added an explicit check for equal speeds
2. Use random.choice to randomly select which creature goes first in case of a tie
3. Maintained the existing logic for non-tie situations
4. Added random module import at the top

This change ensures the battle system properly implements the speed tie resolution mechanic as specified in the documentation while maintaining all other functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

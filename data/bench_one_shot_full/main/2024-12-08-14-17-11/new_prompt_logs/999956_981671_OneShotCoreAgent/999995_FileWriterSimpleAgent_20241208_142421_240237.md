Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling reset() on the creature, we'll directly set its hp to max_hp in the scene

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Added _reset_creatures() method to MainGameScene
3. Updated the scene to use _reset_creatures() instead of calling reset() on the creatures directly

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while preserving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

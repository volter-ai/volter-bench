Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the models following the dependency order:
- Skill (no dependencies)
- Creature (depends on Skill)
- Player (depends on Creature)

2. Create JSON files for each model with the prototypes:
- skill.json with "tackle"
- creature.json with "bubwool" and "scizard" 
- player.json with "default_player" and "basic_opponent"

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene)
- MainGameScene that implements the battle logic with phases

4. Create tests for both scenes using random mode testing

Key considerations:
- Models will be pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing
- Scene logic will handle all game mechanics
- Will use _wait_for_choice for both human and bot decisions
- Will show all relevant game state in scene __str__ methods
- Will use from_prototype_id for creating entities
- Will handle bot players exactly like human players

Let me implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines and creates a complete creature battler game with:
- Pure data models for Skill, Creature and Player
- JSON files defining all prototypes
- MainMenuScene for navigation
- MainGameScene implementing the full battle system with phases
- Proper testing using random mode
- Correct handling of both human and bot players
- Proper scene transitions and game state management

The game can be run from main.py and will allow players to battle their Bubwool against a bot's Scizard using the Tackle skill.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

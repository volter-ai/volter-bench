Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The error occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with an empty list of choices. Looking at the test output, this happens when trying to swap creatures. The issue is in the `get_player_action` method where we're not handling the case when there are no valid creatures to swap to.

The fix needs to:
1. Handle the case when there are no valid swap targets
2. Return to the main choice menu if there are no valid swaps
3. Keep the pure data model approach intact

The solution is to modify the MainGameScene to check if there are valid swap targets before showing the swap option, and if the player somehow gets to the swap menu with no valid targets, return them to the main choice menu.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_creatures` helper method to centralize the logic for finding valid swap targets
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show the Swap option if there are valid targets
3. Updated the scene's `__str__` to indicate that Swap is conditional
4. Used the helper method in `handle_knockout` for consistency
5. Kept all models as pure data schemas with no changes needed

This should prevent the empty choices list error while maintaining the game's architecture and functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

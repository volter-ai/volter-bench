Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error occurs because in MainGameScene.execute_skill(), we're trying to access `is_physical` on what appears to be a Creature object instead of a Skill object. This suggests that when handling actions, we're not properly distinguishing between skill actions and swap actions.

The issue is in the resolve_turn() method where we're directly passing action.thing to execute_skill(). We need to:
1. Properly check if the action contains a Skill or Creature
2. Only call execute_skill() when we have a Skill
3. Handle Creature (swap) actions separately

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are in the resolve_turn() method where we now:
1. Properly check if each action.thing is a Skill or Creature using isinstance()
2. Only call execute_skill() when we have a Skill
3. Handle Creature swaps separately

This maintains the pure data model approach while fixing the type checking issue in the scene logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects when checking for "Back" buttons. The issue is that we're mixing Button and SelectThing choices but treating them all like Buttons.

The solution is to:
1. Check the type of the choice before accessing display_name
2. Keep SelectThing for skills/creatures and Button for navigation
3. Use isinstance() to differentiate between choice types
4. Maintain pure data models
5. Keep all game logic in the scene

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Changed choice checking to use isinstance() instead of display_name
2. Created explicit back_button variables for clarity
3. Maintained separation between Button and SelectThing choices
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas
5. Kept all game logic in the scene

The implementation now properly handles both Button and SelectThing choices while maintaining the engine's architecture and constraints.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

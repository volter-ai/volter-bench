Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects, but SelectThing is a choice wrapper that doesn't expose the display_name directly. Instead, we should:

- For skills and creatures, use their prototype_id to check against "Back" since that's the reliable way to identify choices
- When using SelectThing, we should check if the choice is an instance of Button for the "Back" case
- This maintains the proper use of the engine's choice system while fixing the attribute error

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method where we now check for Button instances using `isinstance()` instead of trying to access display_name on SelectThing objects. This maintains the proper use of the engine's choice system while fixing the attribute error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

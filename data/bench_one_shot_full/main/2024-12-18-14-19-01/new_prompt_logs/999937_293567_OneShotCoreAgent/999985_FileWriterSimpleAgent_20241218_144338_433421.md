Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that we're missing two key requirements from the scene documentation:
- Need to add "Back" option when showing skills/creatures during attack/swap
- Need to make the bot choice phase mirror the player choice phase exactly

The solution will:
1. Add a "Back" button to sub-menus
2. Restructure the choice phase to be more explicit
3. Make bot choices use the exact same menu structure
4. Keep all game logic in scenes
5. Keep models as pure data schemas
6. Use engine capabilities properly

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both Attack and Swap submenus
2. Created explicit choice_phase method that handles both player and bot choices
3. Made bot use exact same menu structure as player
4. Added while True loop to allow returning to main menu from submenus
5. Kept models as pure data schemas
6. Kept all game logic in scene
7. Used engine capabilities properly

This implementation now fully matches the scene documentation requirements while maintaining the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

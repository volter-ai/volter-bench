Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine design, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

In our case, when the battle ends (either win or lose), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` since this is a simple game where the player returns to the real world after one battle.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 0f1e06c1-e0a3-4ec0-898e-00e3f4eff732
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will store {player_uid: skill}

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")

                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")

        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0

                multiplier = 0.5
                
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player
        second = self.opponent
        
        if self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:

        # Execute skills
        for attacker in [first, second]:
            if attacker == self.player:
                attacker_creature = self.player_creature
                defender_creature = self.opponent_creature

            skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]

            defender_creature.hp -= damage
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
            
            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                return self.player if defender_creature == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent

        return None
```

Key changes:
1. Modified resolution_phase to return the winning player instead of a boolean
2. Modified the main run loop to properly handle the winner and call _quit_whole_game()
3. Moved the win/loss messages to the main run loop for better flow control
4. Ensured the scene always ends with a proper transition call (_quit_whole_game in this case)

This maintains all the game logic while properly following the engine's scene transition requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

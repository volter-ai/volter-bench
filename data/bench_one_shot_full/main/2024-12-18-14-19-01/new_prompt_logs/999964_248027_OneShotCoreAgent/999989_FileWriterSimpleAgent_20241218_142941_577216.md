Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine design, this exception is expected and should be caught in tests.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py which passes, we can see it uses a different pattern - it patches the quit_whole_game method. We should follow the same pattern in test_main_game_scene.py.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 16a63de1-0702-4e6c-87e4-9e3c57b74e1e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle scenes need more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class GracefulGameEnd(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_game(*args, **kwargs):
                raise GracefulGameEnd()

            # Patch quit_whole_game to raise our test exception instead
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game', side_effect=exit_game):
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except GracefulGameEnd:
                    print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
```

The changes:
1. Added a GracefulGameEnd exception for testing
2. Added a patched exit_game function that raises our test exception
3. Patched _quit_whole_game to use our test function
4. Added proper exception handling for both our test exception and RandomModeGracefulExit

This follows the engine's design where:
- The game must end via _quit_whole_game or scene transition
- Tests should handle these transitions appropriately
- Random mode testing should continue for multiple iterations

The test will now pass while still verifying the game's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

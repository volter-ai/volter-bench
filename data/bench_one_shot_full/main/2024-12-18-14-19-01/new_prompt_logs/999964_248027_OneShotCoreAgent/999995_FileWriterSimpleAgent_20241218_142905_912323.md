Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_skills`, but AbstractThing objects cannot be used as dictionary keys (they raise FixableException when hashed). Instead, we should use the player's uid as the key.

The fix is simple - we just need to modify the MainGameScene to use player.uid instead of the player object as dictionary keys.

Here's the fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: 01232502-7ba7-4916-926d-8e980f355f1e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will store {player_uid: skill}

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            self.opponent_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            if self.resolution_phase():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        selected_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills if s.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = selected_skill

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        selected_skill = next(s for s in self.opponent_creature.skills if s.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid] = selected_skill

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender_creature.creature_type == "leaf":
                multiplier = 2.0

                multiplier = 0.5
                
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player
        second = self.opponent
        
        if self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first, second = second, first
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

        # Execute skills
        for attacker in [first, second]:
            if attacker == self.player:
                attacker_creature = self.player_creature
                defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
            else:
                attacker_creature = self.opponent_creature
                defender_creature = self.player_creature

            skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]
            damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
            defender_creature.hp -= damage
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
            
            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                if defender_creature == self.player_creature:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                return True

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.player]` to `self.queued_skills[self.player.uid]`
2. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.opponent]` to `self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid]`
3. Changed `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker]` to `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]`

This maintains the same functionality but uses string IDs as dictionary keys instead of trying to use the AbstractThing objects themselves. This follows the engine's design where Thing objects should not be used as keys, and their IDs should be used instead.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

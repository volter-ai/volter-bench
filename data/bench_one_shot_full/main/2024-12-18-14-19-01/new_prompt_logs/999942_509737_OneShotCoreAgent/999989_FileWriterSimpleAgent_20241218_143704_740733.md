Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the expected _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's architecture, this is the correct way games end, and we need to handle it in our tests.

The fix is to:
- Add _QuitWholeGame to the exceptions we catch in the test
- Keep the RandomModeGracefulExit catch for when random mode ends naturally
- This maintains proper testing of both natural random mode completion and game ending conditions
- No changes needed to models or game logic, just test handling

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 907b09ea-9285-4bef-9be5-76c213774ff8
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended successfully for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import of AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added success message for game ending condition

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing both ways the game can end:
- Through random mode completion (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- Through normal game completion (_QuitWholeGame)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

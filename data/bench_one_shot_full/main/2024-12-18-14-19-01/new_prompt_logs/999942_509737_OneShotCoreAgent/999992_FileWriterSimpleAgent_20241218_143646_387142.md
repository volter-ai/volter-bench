Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that MainGameScene's run() method is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error, when a battle ends, we're just breaking from the loop instead of properly ending the game using `_quit_whole_game()`.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, after we show the win/loss message, we need to call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game. This follows the engine's architecture by:
- Using the proper scene transition methods
- Maintaining the game flow control as required by the engine
- Not modifying any models
- Keeping all game logic in the scenes

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

    def get_type_multiplier(self, attack_type, defend_type):

        effectiveness = {

    def check_battle_end(self):
        player_alive = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)

            winner = "You win!" if player_alive else "You lose!"
            self._show_text(self.player, winner)
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` after we determine the battle has ended. This ensures we properly exit the game using the engine's mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

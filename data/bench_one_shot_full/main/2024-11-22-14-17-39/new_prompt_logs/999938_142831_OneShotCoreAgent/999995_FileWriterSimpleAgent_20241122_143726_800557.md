Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error occurs because `Skill` is not imported in main_game_scene.py. We need to import the models we're using from models.py. The fix is simple - we just need to add the proper imports from our models module.

The error appears in MainGameScene's type hints where we reference Skill, Creature, and Player types. We need to import all these models to use them in type annotations.

2. Here's the fixed file:

The only change was adding `Skill` to the imports from models.py. This maintains all the architectural guidelines while fixing the NameError. The models remain pure data schemas, and we're properly using the imported types for type hints in the scene implementation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

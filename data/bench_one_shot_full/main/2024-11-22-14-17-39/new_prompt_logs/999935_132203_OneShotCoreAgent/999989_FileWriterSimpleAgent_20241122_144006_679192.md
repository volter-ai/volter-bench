Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because the RandomModeGracefulExit exception from HumanListener isn't being caught properly when transitioning between scenes.

The test needs to:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Handle scene transitions gracefully during random testing
3. Consider both normal game end and random mode end as valid test outcomes

Here's the fixed implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 7c3d77ed-a16b-4ade-b610-e59a2adc5fa4
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added try/except block to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame
3. Added explicit exception handling for unexpected errors
4. Added more detailed logging for different exit conditions

This fix:
- Properly handles both ways the random test can end (random mode timeout or game quit)
- Maintains the engine's architecture by not modifying scene behavior
- Keeps test coverage while handling graceful exits
- Preserves the random testing functionality

The test will now pass as it properly handles all expected exit conditions during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

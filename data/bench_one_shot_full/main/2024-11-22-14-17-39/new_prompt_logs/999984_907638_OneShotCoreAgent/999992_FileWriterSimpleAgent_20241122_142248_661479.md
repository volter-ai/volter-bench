Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's architecture, we need to catch this exception in the test, similar to how the test_main_menu_scene.py handles it.

The test should catch:
- TransitionFromScene (when moving to another scene)
- RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves are exhausted)
- AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame (when game ends)

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d4a4235b-5a67-4660-ae4c-bd8f47c7522e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch the transition method to catch scene transitions
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

This fix:
1. Properly catches the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends
2. Maintains the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py
3. Follows the engine's architecture for handling scene transitions and game endings
4. Keeps the test running through all 10 iterations even if individual games end
5. Provides proper debug output for each type of scene exit

The main change is adding AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the list of expected exceptions, which allows the test to handle normal game endings gracefully.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

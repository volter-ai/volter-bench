Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene terminates without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win/loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly calling _quit_whole_game() or _transition_to_scene().

The fix is simple: In MainGameScene, when check_battle_end() returns true (meaning someone won/lost), we should call _quit_whole_game() instead of just returning. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        def has_available_creatures(player):
            return any(c.hp > 0 for c in player.creatures)
            
        if not has_available_creatures(self.player):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif not has_available_creatures(self.opponent):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed the return statements in get_player_action to return None and continue the loop instead of breaking it
2. Added self._quit_whole_game() when check_battle_end() returns True
3. Made the main loop continue instead of return when actions are None

This ensures the scene always exits properly through _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:

The MainGameScene needs several fixes to match the architecture:

a) Add "Back" option in Player Choice Phase:
- When showing Attack/Swap choices, include a Back button
- When showing skills or creatures for swapping, include a Back button
- When Back is chosen, return to the previous choice level

b) Implement forced swapping for knocked out creatures:
- After damage calculation, check if the creature is knocked out (hp = 0)
- If knocked out, force the owner to swap to another creature with hp > 0
- If no creatures available, end battle

c) Reset creature state when leaving scene:
- Add a reset_creatures() method that restores all creatures' hp to max_hp
- Call this before quitting or transitioning

Here's the fixed implementation:

```

Key changes:
1. Added Back button at every choice level
2. Added handle_knockouts() method to force creature swapping when knocked out
3. Added reset_creatures() method to restore creature state when leaving
4. Updated choice handling to support Back functionality
5. Added knockout checks after each attack
6. Improved the battle loop to properly handle all cases

The implementation now fully matches the architecture documentation while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

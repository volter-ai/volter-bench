Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in our test. The error shows an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, which eventually ends in a QuitWholeGame exception that isn't caught.

The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. We need to:
1. Mock the _transition_to_scene method to prevent the infinite loop
2. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Add proper assertions to verify the scene behaved correctly

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: bf1b5a44-9e56-43e0-984b-6a6ac741b2bb
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Mock transition to prevent infinite loop
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                
                # Verify the scene tried to transition back to menu at least once
                assert mock_transition.called
                assert mock_transition.call_args[0][0] == "MainMenuScene"
                
                # Verify battle ended (either player or opponent should be at 0 HP)
                assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0 or scene.opponent_creature.hp <= 0
```

The key changes are:
1. Added patch for _transition_to_scene to prevent infinite scene transitions
2. Added catch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added assertions to verify:
   - The scene attempted to transition back to menu
   - The battle actually ended (someone's HP reached 0)

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the battle scene in isolation. The test now verifies the core battle mechanics work without getting caught in transition loops.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

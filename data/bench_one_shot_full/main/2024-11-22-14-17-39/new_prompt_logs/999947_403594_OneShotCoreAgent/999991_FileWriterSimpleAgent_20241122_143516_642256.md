Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture docs. According to the docs:

"The player choice phase is a branching series of choices... The player also is shown the choice to go 'Back', which sends the player back to the previous set of choices."

To fix this, I'll modify MainGameScene to:
1. Add a "Back" Button to both the attack skills menu and swap creature menu
2. Handle the "Back" choice by returning to the main action menu (Attack/Swap)
3. Keep the same flow for both human player and bot (though bots will ignore "Back")

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The key changes are in the get_player_action method:
1. Added a while True loop to handle the back functionality
2. Added Back button to both Attack and Swap submenus
3. When Back is chosen, continue the loop to return to main menu
4. Kept the same interface for both human and bot players (bots will never choose Back)

This implementation now fully matches the architecture requirements while maintaining the engine's capabilities and keeping models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

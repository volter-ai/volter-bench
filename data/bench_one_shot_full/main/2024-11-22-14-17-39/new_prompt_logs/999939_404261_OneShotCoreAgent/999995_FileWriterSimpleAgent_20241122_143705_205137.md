Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene terminates without properly ending the game. When a battle ends (win or loss), we're just returning from the run() method instead of explicitly calling `_quit_whole_game()` or transitioning to another scene.

According to the engine's requirements, we must always explicitly end scenes using one of these methods:
- `_quit_whole_game()` - To end the entire game
- `_transition_to_scene()` - To move to another scene

The solution is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the game when a battle concludes by calling `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the battle result message.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes made:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends
2. Changed the return None in get_player_action to continue the main loop instead of breaking it
3. Made sure the main game loop continues if an action is invalid

This ensures the scene always ends properly through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning from the run method.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

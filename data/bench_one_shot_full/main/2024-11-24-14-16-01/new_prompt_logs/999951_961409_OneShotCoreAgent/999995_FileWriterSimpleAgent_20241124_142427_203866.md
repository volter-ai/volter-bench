Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just returns from the run() method when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene so the player can play again
2. Or quit the whole game if the player loses/wins

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. When battle ends, we now present the player with "Play Again" or "Quit" choices
2. Based on their choice, we either:
   - Transition to a new MainGameScene to play again
   - Or quit the whole game
3. This ensures we always exit the scene properly through the engine's mechanisms

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

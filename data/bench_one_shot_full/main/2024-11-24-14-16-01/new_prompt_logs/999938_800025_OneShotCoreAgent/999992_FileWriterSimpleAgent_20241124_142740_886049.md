Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When the game ends (win/loss), we call _quit_whole_game() which raises this exception. According to the error message, this exception is expected and should be caught.

The fix is to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit AND AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in the test file. This matches the engine's design where _QuitWholeGame is a graceful exit mechanism that should be caught by test runners.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 10ccb678-0c7d-4cb3-a066-0452bc7dee11
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game ends gracefully

This maintains all the architecture guidelines while properly handling the engine's graceful exit mechanism. The models remain untouched as pure data schemas, and we're working within the engine's capabilities by properly catching its exit exceptions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win/loss), it just breaks from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

The fix is simple - in MainGameScene, when check_battle_end() returns True (meaning someone won/lost), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game session.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` when check_battle_end() returns True. This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop.

This maintains all the architecture and model guidelines while fixing the scene termination issue. The models remain pure data schemas, and we're using the engine's built-in mechanisms for scene transitions and game termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py - we need to catch the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception just like we did in test_main_menu_scene.py. This is expected behavior when the game ends properly.

The test is failing because the _QuitWholeGame exception is being raised (as it should be) when the battle ends, but we're not catching it in the test. We need to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame as valid ways for the test to complete.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7bcf68a0-7237-46be-9d18-1c91ea3b30f7
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} completed as expected with: {type(e).__name__}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the caught exceptions
3. Added a print statement to show which exception ended the run

This fix:
1. Maintains the architecture by properly handling the engine's quit mechanism
2. Doesn't affect any models
3. Properly tests that the game scene ends as expected (either through random mode timeout or through normal game completion)
4. Stays within the engine's capabilities by using the provided exception types

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can legitimately end:
- RandomModeGracefulExit when the random mode counter hits zero
- AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame when a battle concludes normally

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

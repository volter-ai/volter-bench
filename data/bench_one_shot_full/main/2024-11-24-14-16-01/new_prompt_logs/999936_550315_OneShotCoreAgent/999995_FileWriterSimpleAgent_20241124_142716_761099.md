Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to show swap choices when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all non-active creatures are knocked out. We need to handle this case by not offering the "Swap" choice when there are no valid swap targets.

The fix should be in main_game_scene.py. We'll modify the get_player_action method to only show the "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to.

                return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. In get_player_action(), we now check for valid swap targets before showing the Swap button
2. This ensures we never try to show an empty list of choices to the player
3. The rest of the battle logic remains unchanged
4. This maintains the architecture and model constraints while fixing the bug

The fix stays within the engine's capabilities by only using the provided Button and SelectThing choices, and properly handling the case where no swaps are available by simply not showing that option.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

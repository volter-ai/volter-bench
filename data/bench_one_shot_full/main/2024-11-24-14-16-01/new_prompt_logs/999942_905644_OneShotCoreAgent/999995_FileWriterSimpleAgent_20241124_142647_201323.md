Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference an undefined variable `player_action`. The issue is that we're trying to determine if the current action belongs to the player or bot by comparing it to a non-existent variable.

The fix:
Instead of trying to compare the whole action tuple, we should pass in the owner of the action along with the action itself when executing. We'll modify the resolve_actions method to pass both the action and its owner when calling execute_action.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a766049f-7ae7-49b3-ab37-e64eb4ad8893

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. resolve_actions now takes tuples of (actor, action) instead of just actions
2. get_action_order works with these tuples
3. execute_action takes the actor and action separately
4. Removed the problematic comparison with player_action and instead use the passed in actor parameter

This maintains the architecture and capabilities of the engine while fixing the NameError. The models remain pure data schemas and all game logic stays within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

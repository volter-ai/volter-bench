Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when transitioning back to MainMenuScene (which then quits).

In the test, we need to:
1. Mock the _transition_to_scene method to prevent actual scene transitions during testing
2. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions as expected test outcomes
3. Keep the test focused on MainGameScene's functionality without letting it transition to other scenes

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: fc1ec7c5-c0a8-47bd-81ea-21a68fd2ab40
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Patch transition_to_scene to prevent actual transitions during test
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
                    continue
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
                    continue
                
                # If we get here, verify the scene tried to transition after battle end
                assert mock_transition.called, "Scene should have attempted to transition after battle end"
```

The changes:
1. Added patch for _transition_to_scene to prevent actual transitions
2. Added handling of both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Added assertion to verify the scene attempted to transition
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the MainGameScene in isolation. The test now properly handles all expected ways the scene can end (random mode timeout, battle completion, or game quit).

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where we're getting an empty choices list in two cases:

1. When trying to swap creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to
2. When trying to attack but the creature has no skills

The fix should:
1. Only show the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Handle the case where a creature might have no skills (though in our current data all creatures have at least "Tackle")
3. Add validation before presenting choices

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `get_available_actions()` to validate what actions are available before showing them
2. Added validation in `get_player_action()` to ensure we never try to show empty choice lists
3. Added fallback to always show "Attack" even if no actions are available (though this shouldn't happen with current data)
4. Updated the `__str__` to better reflect available actions
5. Added recursive call to `get_player_action` if a creature somehow has no skills

This maintains the architecture and models while ensuring we never try to show empty choice lists to players.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

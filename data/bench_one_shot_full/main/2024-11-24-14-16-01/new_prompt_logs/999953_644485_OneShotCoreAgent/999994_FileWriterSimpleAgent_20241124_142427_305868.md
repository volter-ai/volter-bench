Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue with speed tie handling in MainGameScene.

The issue is that when creatures have equal speed, we're not implementing the random selection as specified in the architecture document which states:
"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

Here's how I'll fix it:
1. Add a speed tie check in MainGameScene
2. Use random.random() to give each creature a 50% chance of going first in speed ties
3. Keep the rest of the battle logic the same

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

            else:
                # Speed tie - 50% chance for either to go first

                else:

                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
                
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Split the speed comparison into three cases: player faster, opponent faster, and equal speed
2. Added random.random() < 0.5 check to give 50/50 chance in speed ties
3. Maintained all other battle mechanics as specified

This change ensures we properly follow the architecture requirement for random resolution of speed ties while keeping all other battle mechanics intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of properly ending the game using `_quit_whole_game()`. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must either transition to another scene or quit the game - it cannot just end.

Solution:
I'll modify the MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends (either win or lose). This follows the engine's pattern where scenes must explicitly end through a transition or quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c04a726e-70c6-47b0-94bd-8530aa0eb424
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self, first, second, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first, second, first_skill)
        second.hp -= damage

        # Check if battle ended
        if second.hp <= 0:
            return
            
        # Second attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(second, first, second_skill)
        first.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{second.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice
            skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

            # Bot choice
            bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])
            bot_skill = next(s for s in self.opponent_creature.skills 
                           if s.display_name == bot_choice.display_name)

            # Determine order
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first, second = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, bot_skill
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first, second = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = bot_skill, player_skill
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first, second = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
                    first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, bot_skill
                else:
                    first, second = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
                    first_skill, second_skill = bot_skill, player_skill

            self.execute_turn(first, second, first_skill, second_skill)

            # Check win conditions and properly end game
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._quit_whole_game()
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._quit_whole_game()
```

The key change is replacing the `break` statements with `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements. The rest of the battle logic remains the same, we just ensure proper scene termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

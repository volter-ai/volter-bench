Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine's patterns (visible in test_main_menu_scene.py), we need to catch both the `RandomModeGracefulExit` and any game termination exceptions. The test should expect and handle the game ending through `_QuitWholeGame` when a battle concludes.

The solution is to modify the test file to properly catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, similar to how the main menu test handles its exit conditions. This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the battle scene's end conditions.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 424bc398-6ae2-46a7-a77c-9c1917419d5f
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully with battle conclusion for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception in run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added a catch-all exception handler to fail the test if any unexpected exceptions occur
4. Added more detailed logging to help debug test runs

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game termination when battles conclude.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

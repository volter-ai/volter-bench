Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan this out carefully:

1. First, I'll create the models in strict dependency order:
- Skill (no dependencies)
- Creature (depends on Skill)
- Player (depends on Creature)

2. Create JSON files for each model matching the prototypes described in the docs:
- skill.json with "tackle"
- creature.json with "bubwool" 
- player.json with "default_player"

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene)
- MainGameScene (needs to be created with battle logic)

4. Create tests for both scenes using random mode testing

5. Update main.py to register both scenes

Key considerations:
- Models will be pure data schemas
- All references between models will be direct type references
- Scene logic will handle all game mechanics
- Will use proper transitions between scenes
- Will handle both player and bot interactions consistently
- Will use prototype system for creating entities

Here's the implementation:

This implementation follows all the guidelines and creates a complete working game where:
1. Players start at the main menu
2. They can choose to play or quit
3. In battle, they face off against a bot
4. Both players and bots take turns using skills
5. The battle continues until one creature is defeated
6. Players return to the main menu after the battle
7. All entities are created via prototypes
8. All scenes are properly tested with random runs

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title and buttons correctly positioned. However, the error message indicates a timeout, suggesting that the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to an issue with the rendering logic or a missing element that the simulator expects.

### Analysis

1. **Visibility of Elements**: The game title and buttons are visible and correctly positioned according to the design document.
2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The simulator might be waiting for an interaction or a specific state that is not being reached.
   - The `emitButtonClick` function might not be triggering correctly due to missing button slugs or incorrect logic.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Button Slugs**: Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` array contains the expected values ('play' and 'quit') and that the `emitButtonClick` function is correctly triggered.
2. **Adjust Layout**: Ensure that the layout is not causing any elements to be off-screen or hidden, although this seems correct from the image.

### Code Changes

- Verify that `useCurrentButtons` is providing the correct button slugs.
- Ensure that the `emitButtonClick` function is correctly implemented and that the buttons are interactive.

### Implementation

# Excerpt ID: 40b389fd-4b35-4d12-bc0d-d20c1a856756
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Button Slugs**: Ensure that `useCurrentButtons` is correctly providing the button slugs and that `emitButtonClick` is called with the correct slug.
- **Layout**: The layout is already correct, so no changes are needed there.
- **Interactivity**: Ensure that the buttons are interactive and that the simulator can detect the button clicks.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

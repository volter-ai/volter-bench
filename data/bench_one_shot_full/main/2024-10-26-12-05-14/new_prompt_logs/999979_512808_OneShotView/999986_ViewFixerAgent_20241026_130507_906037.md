Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed: 
Error in main process: 364 | async function main() {
365 |     try {
366 |         await Promise.race([
367 |             simulateGameplay(gameUrl),
368 |             new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => {
369 |                 reject(new Error(`Timeout after ${RUN_TIMEOUT / 1000}s`))

error: Timeout after 120s
at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title and buttons correctly positioned. However, the error message indicates a timeout, suggesting that the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to an issue with the rendering logic or a missing element that the simulator expects.

### Analysis

1. **Visibility of Elements**: The game title and buttons are visible and correctly positioned according to the design document.
2. **Potential Issues**:
   - The simulator might be waiting for an interaction or a specific state that is not being reached.
   - The `emitButtonClick` function might not be triggering correctly due to missing button slugs or incorrect logic.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Button Slugs**: Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` array contains the expected values ('play' and 'quit') and that the `emitButtonClick` function is correctly triggered.
2. **Adjust Layout**: Ensure that the layout is not causing any elements to be off-screen or hidden, although this seems correct from the image.

### Code Changes

- Verify that `useCurrentButtons` is providing the correct button slugs.
- Ensure that the `emitButtonClick` function is correctly implemented and that the buttons are interactive.

### Implementation

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Button Slugs**: Ensure that `useCurrentButtons` is correctly providing the button slugs and that `emitButtonClick` is called with the correct slug.
- **Layout**: The layout is already correct, so no changes are needed there.
- **Interactivity**: Ensure that the buttons are interactive and that the simulator can detect the button clicks.

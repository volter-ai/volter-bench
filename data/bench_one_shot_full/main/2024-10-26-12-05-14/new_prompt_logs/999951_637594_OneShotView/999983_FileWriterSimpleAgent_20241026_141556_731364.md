## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can see that the main menu scene is rendering correctly. The game title is displayed at the top of the screen, and the "Play" and "Quit" buttons are visible at the bottom. The layout matches the description in the design document.

The issue causing the timeout error is not visible in the UI itself. The problem is likely related to the game simulation or the handling of button clicks. Since the UI is rendering correctly, we need to focus on the interaction part of the component.

Proposed solution:
1. Ensure that the `useCurrentButtons` hook is working correctly and returning the expected values.
2. Add error handling for the `emitButtonClick` function to catch any potential issues.
3. Add console logs to help debug the issue and understand where the timeout might be occurring.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: cad621fd-8551-413e-9de8-6d7bd96eb952
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { useEffect } from 'react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    useEffect(() => {
        console.log("Available button slugs:", availableButtonSlugs);
    }, [availableButtonSlugs]);

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
        console.log("Button clicked:", slug);
        try {
            emitButtonClick(slug);
        } catch (error) {
            console.error("Error emitting button click:", error);
        }
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {(availableButtonSlugs || []).map((slug) => (
                    <Button
                        key={slug}
                        onClick={() => handleButtonClick(slug)}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                        {getButtonText(slug)}
                    </Button>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Changes made:
1. Added a `useEffect` hook to log the available button slugs when they change. This will help us understand if the `useCurrentButtons` hook is working correctly.
2. Created a `handleButtonClick` function that wraps the `emitButtonClick` call in a try-catch block. This will catch any errors that might occur when emitting the button click.
3. Added console logs to track when buttons are clicked and if any errors occur during the click emission.

These changes will help identify where the timeout is occurring and provide more information for debugging the issue. The UI itself remains unchanged, as it was already rendering correctly according to the design document.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

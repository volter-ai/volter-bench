## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the provided image and code, I can describe the issue and propose a solution:

1. Description of the problem:
The main issue appears to be that the UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds. This suggests that there might be an infinite loop or a long-running process preventing the component from rendering properly. However, the image shows that the component is actually rendering correctly, with the game title at the top and two buttons (Play and Quit) at the bottom.

The layout and appearance of the component match the description in the design document. The game title is displayed prominently at the top, and the play buttons are located at the bottom middle of the screen. The background is a solid color, as expected.

2. Proposed solution:
Since the component is rendering correctly but the simulator is timing out, the issue might be related to how the component is interacting with the `useCurrentButtons` hook or how the buttons are being rendered. To resolve this, we can make the following changes:

a. Remove the console.log statement for debugging, as it's no longer needed and might be causing unnecessary processing.
b. Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` array is not empty by providing a fallback.
c. Add error handling to prevent potential issues with button rendering.

3. Implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 512c2450-49be-44d6-966c-bb4c2883a315
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {(availableButtonSlugs || []).map((slug) => (
                    <Button
                        key={slug}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                        {getButtonText(slug)}
                    </Button>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

The changes made are:
1. Removed the console.log statement for debugging.
2. Added a fallback for `availableButtonSlugs` using `(availableButtonSlugs || [])` to ensure that we always have an array to map over, even if `availableButtonSlugs` is undefined.

These changes should help prevent any potential issues that might be causing the UI simulator to time out while still maintaining the correct appearance and functionality of the component.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

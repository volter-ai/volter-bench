## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The main issue seems to be a timeout error during the UI simulation, which could be due to the UI not rendering as expected. From the image, the layout appears correct, but there might be issues with the button functionality or the rendering process itself.

### Analysis

1. **Visibility and Layout**: The game title and buttons are visible and positioned correctly according to the design document.
2. **Button Functionality**: The buttons are present, but the timeout error suggests they might not be functioning as expected. This could be due to the `emitButtonClick` function not being triggered properly.
3. **Code Review**: The code seems to be structured correctly, but we need to ensure that the `emitButtonClick` function is only called with available button slugs.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Button Slugs**: Ensure that `emitButtonClick` is only called with slugs that are available.
2. **Debugging**: Add console logs to verify that the buttons are being rendered and clicked as expected.

### Implementation

# Excerpt ID: c40ce46d-d65d-48c3-982b-d83e0846dd40
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const player = props.data.entities.player;
    const playerName = player?.display_name || "Default Player";

    console.log("Available buttons:", availableButtonSlugs);

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-blue-500 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Game Title</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">
                Welcome, {playerName}!
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-700"
                        onClick={() => {
                            console.log("Play button clicked");
                            emitButtonClick('play');
                        }}
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600"
                        onClick={() => {
                            console.log("Quit button clicked");
                            emitButtonClick('quit');
                        }}
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Console Logs**: Added logs to verify the availability of button slugs and to confirm button clicks.
- **Button Slug Check**: Ensured that `emitButtonClick` is only called with available slugs.

This should help identify if the buttons are being rendered and clicked correctly, and if the `emitButtonClick` function is being triggered as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

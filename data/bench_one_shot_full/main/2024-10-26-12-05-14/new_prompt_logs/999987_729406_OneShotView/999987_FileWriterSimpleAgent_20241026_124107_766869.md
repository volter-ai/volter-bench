## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The background gradient is not visible in the image, which shows a solid blue background instead.
2. The player's stat1 is not displayed in the image, although it's present in the code.
3. The buttons are styled differently in the image compared to the code.
4. The "uid" prop is being incorrectly applied to the Button components.

Proposed solution:

1. Remove the gradient background and use a solid color to match the image.
2. Remove the conditional rendering of the player's stat1 as it's not visible in the image.
3. Adjust the button styles to match the image, including size, color, and icon placement.
4. Remove the "uid" prop from the Button components as they are not custom UI elements.

Here's the implemented solution:

# Excerpt ID: d7d7a61d-7dd5-4457-acb4-3172dac05962
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const player = props.data.entities.player;
    const playerName = player?.display_name || "Default Player";

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-blue-500 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Game Title</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">
                Welcome, {playerName}!
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl bg-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-700"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

These changes should resolve the issues and make the component match the provided image more closely. The background is now a solid blue color, the player's stat1 display has been removed, and the button styles have been adjusted to better match the image. The "uid" props have also been removed from the Button components as they are not custom UI elements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle_loop method to break out of the loop when the battle ends and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: f45ba34f-3ba1-4df2-9b8f-052b966ba72d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed or (creature1.speed == creature2.speed and random.choice([True, False])):
            return (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1)
        else:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender, defender_creature):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that the scene always transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends.
2. Moving the `reset_creatures` call to the `run` method, so it's executed after the battle loop ends but before transitioning to the main menu.
3. Keeping the `battle_loop` method focused on the battle logic, and allowing it to break when the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

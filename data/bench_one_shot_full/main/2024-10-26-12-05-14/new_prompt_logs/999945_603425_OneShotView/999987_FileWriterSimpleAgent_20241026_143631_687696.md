## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom, which matches the design document. However, the error indicates a timeout, suggesting that the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to an issue with the `useCurrentButtons` hook or the rendering logic that prevents the UI from updating correctly.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check `useCurrentButtons` Hook**: Ensure that `useCurrentButtons` is correctly providing `availableButtonSlugs` and `emitButtonClick`. If this hook is not functioning as expected, it could cause the UI to hang.

2. **Ensure Proper Rendering**: Verify that the buttons are being rendered correctly and that the `emitButtonClick` function is being called with the correct arguments.

3. **Adjust CSS for Visibility**: Ensure that the CSS does not inadvertently hide elements or cause layout issues.

### Implementation

Here's the revised code with potential fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 09afff35-cf51-410c-9e1a-65b787b8480d
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
                    <Button
                        key={slug}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                        {getButtonText(slug)}
                    </Button>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Hook Verification**: Ensure `useCurrentButtons` is correctly implemented and returns the expected values.
- **Rendering Logic**: Confirm that `availableButtonSlugs` is not empty and that `emitButtonClick` is correctly triggered.
- **CSS Adjustments**: Ensure that the layout is not causing elements to be hidden or misaligned.

By ensuring these elements are correctly implemented, the UI should render as expected without causing a timeout.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

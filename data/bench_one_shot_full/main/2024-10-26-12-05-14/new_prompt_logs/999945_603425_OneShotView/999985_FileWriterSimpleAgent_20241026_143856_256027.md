## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom, which matches the design document. However, the error message indicates a timeout, suggesting that the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **Performance Issues**: The rendering might be taking too long due to inefficient code or excessive re-renders.
2. **Event Handling**: The `emitButtonClick` function might not be working as expected, causing the simulator to hang.
3. **Layout Issues**: Although the layout appears correct, there might be hidden elements or CSS issues causing delays.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Optimize Rendering**: Ensure that the rendering process is efficient and does not cause unnecessary re-renders.
2. **Check Event Handling**: Verify that `emitButtonClick` is correctly implemented and does not cause any blocking operations.
3. **CSS Adjustments**: Ensure that CSS is not causing any layout thrashing or performance issues.

### Code Changes

- Ensure that the `useCurrentButtons` hook is correctly implemented and does not cause performance issues.
- Verify that `emitButtonClick` is correctly emitting events without blocking.
- Check CSS for any potential performance issues.

### Rewritten Code

# Excerpt ID: df5c78b5-e3d1-49df-9c21-9280993a3404
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
                    <Button
                        key={slug}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                        {getButtonText(slug)}
                    </Button>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Rendering Optimization**: Ensure that the `useCurrentButtons` hook is optimized and does not cause unnecessary re-renders.
- **Event Handling**: Ensure `emitButtonClick` is correctly implemented and does not block the UI.
- **CSS**: The CSS is minimal and should not cause performance issues, but ensure no hidden elements are causing layout thrashing.

This solution should address the timeout issue by ensuring efficient rendering and event handling.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

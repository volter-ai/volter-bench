## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The main issue is a timeout error in the UI simulator, which suggests that the UI might not be rendering or interacting as expected. From the image, the layout seems correct, with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom. However, the timeout error could be due to the buttons not being interactive or the UI not responding as expected.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Ensure Button Interactivity**: Verify that the buttons are interactive and that `emitButtonClick` is correctly triggered.
2. **Check for Hidden Elements**: Ensure no elements are hidden or off-screen, which could cause the simulator to hang.
3. **Optimize Layout**: Ensure the layout is responsive and elements are correctly aligned.

### Code Changes

- Ensure the `Button` component is correctly set up to handle clicks.
- Verify that `availableButtonSlugs` is populated and used correctly.

### Rewritten Code

# Excerpt ID: 37c0c202-a84b-4175-9a82-8f3a46d528dc
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
                    <Button
                        key={slug}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                        {getButtonText(slug)}
                    </Button>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Button Interactivity**: Ensure `emitButtonClick(slug)` is correctly called on button click.
- **Layout**: The layout uses `flex` to ensure elements are centered and spaced correctly.
- **Visibility**: All elements are visible and correctly aligned, matching the design document.

This should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring the UI is interactive and responsive.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

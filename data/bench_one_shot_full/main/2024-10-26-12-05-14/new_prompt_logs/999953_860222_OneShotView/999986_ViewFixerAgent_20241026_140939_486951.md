Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1"></div>
      
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center shadow-lg">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-end space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed: 
Error in main process: 364 | async function main() {
365 |     try {
366 |         await Promise.race([
367 |             simulateGameplay(gameUrl),
368 |             new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => {
369 |                 reject(new Error(`Timeout after ${RUN_TIMEOUT / 1000}s`))

error: Timeout after 120s
at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows that the title and buttons are not positioned as described in the design document. The title is at the top, but the buttons are directly below it, not at the bottom middle of the screen. This misalignment could be causing the UI simulator to time out, as it might be expecting the elements to be in specific positions.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Adjust Flexbox Layout**: Ensure the title is at the top and the buttons are at the bottom by using `flex-grow` properties correctly.
2. **Check Flexbox Alignment**: Ensure the `justify-between` property is correctly applied to distribute space between the title and buttons.

### Code Changes

- Adjust the flex properties to ensure the title and buttons are positioned correctly.
- Ensure the `flex-1` divs are used to push the buttons to the bottom.

### Rewritten Code

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center shadow-lg">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex-1"></div>

      <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-end space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Flexbox Adjustments**: The `flex-1` divs are used to push the buttons to the bottom by creating space between the title and buttons.
- **Layout Correction**: The `justify-between` property ensures the title and buttons are correctly spaced apart, aligning with the design document's requirements.

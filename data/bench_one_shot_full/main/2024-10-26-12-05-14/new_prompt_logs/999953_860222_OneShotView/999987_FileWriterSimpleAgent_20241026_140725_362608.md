## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The game title ("MainMenuScene") is displayed at the top of the screen instead of the middle, as specified in the design document.
2. The buttons are positioned at the top-center of the screen instead of the bottom-middle.
3. The background gradient appears to be incorrect, with the purple color dominating instead of a balanced blue-to-purple gradient.

These issues are likely causing the timeout error because the rendered scene doesn't match the expected layout, potentially interfering with the UI simulator's ability to interact with the elements.

Proposed solution:

1. Adjust the layout of the main container to properly position the title and buttons.
2. Modify the background gradient to better match the design specifications.
3. Ensure that the title and buttons are properly sized and positioned.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 40a8b38f-b962-4378-8e66-d47ec1ffcf68
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1"></div>
      
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center shadow-lg">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-end space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Adjusted the main container's layout by adding three flex-1 divs to create a top, middle, and bottom section.
2. Moved the title to the middle section, ensuring it's centered both vertically and horizontally.
3. Moved the buttons to the bottom section, using `justify-end` to align them towards the bottom.
4. Removed the `mb-16` class from the button container to allow proper bottom alignment.
5. The background gradient remains unchanged as it should already create a blue-to-purple gradient. If it appears incorrect in the rendered image, it might be due to the simulator's rendering or CSS interpretation.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and bring the component in line with the design document specifications. This should help prevent the timeout error by ensuring that the UI elements are in their expected positions for the simulator to interact with them properly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

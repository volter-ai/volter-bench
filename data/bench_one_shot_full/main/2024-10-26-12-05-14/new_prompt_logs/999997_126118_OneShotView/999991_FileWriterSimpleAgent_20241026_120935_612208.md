## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and following the guidelines more closely.

# Excerpt ID: ef74a82e-7ae8-4af4-b3f5-851cd697df04
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
    stats: Record<string, number>,
    meta: Record<string, any>,
    collections: Record<string, any[]>,
    uid: string,
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const buttonConfig = {
        play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
        quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                {props.data.display_name || "Creature Adventure"}
            </div>

            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
                    if (!config) return null;

                    return (
                        <button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                            className="w-48 h-12 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-blue-600 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors"
                        >
                            <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
                            <span>{config.label}</span>
                        </button>
                    );
                })}
            </div>

            <div className="text-white text-sm">
                Welcome, {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Adventurer"}!
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues:

1. We've kept all the original interfaces, including ExamplePlayer and the full GameUIData.
2. We're not using any custom UI components that require a uid prop. Instead, we're using a standard HTML button element with Tailwind classes for styling.
3. We've removed the import of the Button component, as we're not sure if it's available.
4. We're utilizing more of the GameUIData structure, such as using props.data.display_name for the title if available.
5. We've kept the existing imports as they were in the original boilerplate.
6. The component still maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio and full-screen layout as requested.
7. We're using null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.

This version should now comply with all the guidelines provided and be ready for use in the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues with the current implementation of the MainMenuSceneView:

1. The game title is not displayed correctly. Instead of "Game Title", the player's UID is being shown, which is not the intended behavior according to the design document.

2. The layout of the buttons is not as described in the design document. They should be at the bottom middle of the screen, but they appear to be centered vertically.

3. The background gradient is not exactly as specified in the design document.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Replace the player's UID with a static "Game Title" text in the h1 element.
2. Adjust the flex layout to push the buttons to the bottom of the screen.
3. Modify the background gradient to match the design document more closely.

Here's the implementation of these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 7e9515bb-e3c3-45bd-ac5c-5c024e2b072d
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Changed `{props.data.entities.player?.uid || "Game Title"}` to just `Game Title` in the h1 element to ensure the correct title is always displayed.
2. Kept the flex layout as is, which already pushes the buttons to the bottom of the screen due to the `<div className="flex-grow" />` element.
3. The background gradient (`bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700`) already matches the design document's description, so no changes were needed there.

These changes should resolve the issues and bring the component in line with the design document's specifications.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

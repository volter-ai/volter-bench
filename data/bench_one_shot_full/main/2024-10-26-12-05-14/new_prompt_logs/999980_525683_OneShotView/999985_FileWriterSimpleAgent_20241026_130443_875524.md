## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can describe the issue and propose a solution:

1. Description of the problem:
The main issue appears to be that the UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds. This suggests that there might be an infinite loop or a long-running process preventing the component from rendering properly. However, the image shows that the component is actually rendering correctly, with the game title and buttons displayed as expected.

The rendered image matches the code's structure, showing:
- A blue gradient background
- The "Game Title" text at the top
- "Play Game" and "Quit Game" buttons at the bottom

Given that the UI is rendering correctly but the simulator is timing out, the issue is likely not with the visual representation but with some underlying logic or event handling.

2. Proposed solution:
Since the visual representation is correct, we need to focus on potential issues that could cause the simulator to hang:

a) Ensure that the `useCurrentButtons` hook is not causing any infinite loops or long-running processes.
b) Simplify the button rendering logic to reduce complexity.
c) Remove any unnecessary computations or state updates that might be happening in the background.

3. Implementation of the solution:

Here's the rewritten code with the proposed changes:

# Excerpt ID: 0128edf9-315b-4195-bf48-8896fdd064fc
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                    {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                        <Button
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                            className="w-48"
                        >
                            <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                        </Button>
                    )}
                    {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                        <Button
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                            variant="destructive"
                            className="w-48"
                        >
                            <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                        </Button>
                    )}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Changes made:
1. Removed the `renderButtons` function and integrated its logic directly into the JSX. This simplifies the component structure and reduces the chance of unnecessary re-renders.
2. Removed the `<div className="flex-grow" />` as it doesn't seem to be necessary for the layout based on the image.
3. Kept the button rendering logic intact, as it correctly uses the `availableButtonSlugs` and `emitButtonClick` from the `useCurrentButtons` hook.

These changes maintain the visual appearance of the component while simplifying its structure. If the timeout issue persists, the problem likely lies within the `useCurrentButtons` hook or in the parent component that's rendering `MainMenuSceneView`. You may need to investigate those areas further if this solution doesn't resolve the timeout.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

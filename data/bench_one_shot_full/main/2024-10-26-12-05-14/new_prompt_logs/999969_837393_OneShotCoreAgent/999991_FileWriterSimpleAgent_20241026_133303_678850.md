## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the previous implementation. Let's address this issue by adding the random decision logic for creatures with equal speed during the resolution phase.

1. Description of the fix:

We will modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include a random decision when the creatures have equal speed. Here's how we'll do it:

- We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
- If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly select which creature goes first.
- We'll then execute the skills in the order determined by either the speed comparison or the random selection.

This change will be implemented entirely within the `MainGameScene` class, so we don't need to modify any models or other parts of the architecture. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e157efc1-97f8-4d0a-88ea-6d0c1061be29
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now includes the random decision logic for creatures with equal speed during the resolution phase. When the speeds are equal, it randomly selects which creature goes first and informs the player of this decision. This change aligns with the specified requirements and maintains the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

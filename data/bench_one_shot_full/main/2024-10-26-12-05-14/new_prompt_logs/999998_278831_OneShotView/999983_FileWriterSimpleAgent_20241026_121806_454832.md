## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can see that the main menu scene is rendering correctly. The game title, welcome message, and both "Play" and "Quit" buttons are visible and positioned as expected. The layout matches the description in the design document.

The issue causing the timeout error is likely not related to the visual rendering of the component, but rather to the game simulation process. The UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds, which suggests that there might be an infinite loop or a long-running process in the game logic that's preventing the simulation from completing.

To address this issue, we need to focus on optimizing the game simulation process rather than changing the UI component. However, since we don't have access to the game simulation code, we can't directly fix that part.

For the MainMenuSceneView component itself, there are no apparent issues that would cause a timeout. The component is correctly using the useCurrentButtons hook, and it's rendering the buttons based on the availableButtonSlugs.

To ensure that the component is as efficient as possible, we can make a few minor optimizations:

1. Memoize the player name to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
2. Use a callback for the button click handlers to ensure they're not recreated on every render.

Here's the optimized version of the component:

# Excerpt ID: bf46a664-542f-4b2c-bc26-6095e1f395ec
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import React, { useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const playerName = useMemo(() => props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Default Player", [props.data.entities.player?.display_name]);

    const handlePlayClick = useCallback(() => emitButtonClick('play'), [emitButtonClick]);
    const handleQuitClick = useCallback(() => emitButtonClick('quit'), [emitButtonClick]);

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-blue-500 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Game Title</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">
                Welcome, {playerName}!
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={handlePlayClick}
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={handleQuitClick}
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

These optimizations should help reduce any potential performance issues in the component itself. However, it's important to note that the timeout error is likely occurring in the game simulation process, which is outside the scope of this component. To fully resolve the issue, the game simulation logic would need to be investigated and optimized.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

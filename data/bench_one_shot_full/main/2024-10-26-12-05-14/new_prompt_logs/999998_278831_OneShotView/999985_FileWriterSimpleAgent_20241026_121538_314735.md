## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can describe the issues and propose a solution:

1. Description of the problem:
The main issue seems to be that the UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds. This could be due to the component not rendering properly or some asynchronous operations not completing in time. 

Looking at the image, we can see that the layout is generally correct, with the game title at the top, a welcome message in the middle, and two buttons (Play and Quit) at the bottom. However, there are a few discrepancies between the code and the rendered image:

a) The background gradient is not visible in the image; it's a solid blue color.
b) The player's name is shown as "Default Player" instead of using the `playerName` variable.
c) The player's stat (Stat1) is not displayed.

2. Proposed solution:
To resolve these issues and potentially fix the timeout problem, we should make the following changes:

a) Simplify the background to a solid color to match the image.
b) Ensure that the player name is correctly displayed using the `playerName` variable.
c) Remove the conditional rendering of the player's stat, as it's not shown in the image.
d) Add error handling and optional chaining to prevent potential runtime errors.
e) Remove the `uid` prop from the Button components, as they are not custom UI elements.

3. Implementation of the solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Default Player";

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-blue-500 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Game Title</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">
                Welcome, {playerName}!
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

These changes should resolve the discrepancies between the code and the rendered image, and potentially fix the timeout issue by simplifying the component and removing potential sources of errors or delays.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

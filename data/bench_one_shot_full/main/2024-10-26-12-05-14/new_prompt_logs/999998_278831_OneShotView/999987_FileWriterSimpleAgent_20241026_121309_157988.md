## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The main issue seems to be a timeout error during the UI simulation, which could be due to the layout not matching the expected design. From the image, the layout appears correct, but there might be issues with the rendering or interaction logic that are not visible in the static image.

### Observations from the Image

1. **Game Title**: The title is correctly centered at the top.
2. **Player Welcome Message**: The welcome message is displayed correctly.
3. **Buttons**: Both "Play" and "Quit" buttons are visible and centered at the bottom.

### Potential Issues

- **Timeout Error**: This could be due to the `emitButtonClick` function not being triggered correctly, or the buttons not being recognized as interactive elements.
- **Button Visibility**: Ensure that the buttons are not being conditionally rendered incorrectly.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Button Rendering**: Ensure that the buttons are rendered based on the correct conditions.
2. **Ensure Button Interactivity**: Verify that the `emitButtonClick` function is correctly set up to handle button clicks.

### Code Changes

- Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` array is correctly populated and that the buttons are rendered based on this array.
- Verify that the `emitButtonClick` function is correctly called with the appropriate slug.

### Rewritten Code

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const player = props.data.entities.player;
    const playerName = player?.display_name || "Player";

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Game Title</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">

                {player?.stats?.stat1 !== undefined && (
                    <div className="text-lg">Stat1: {player.stats.stat1}</div>
                )}
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid="play-button"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid="quit-button"
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Button Rendering**: The buttons are conditionally rendered based on the `availableButtonSlugs` array, ensuring they are only displayed when available.
- **Button Click Handling**: The `emitButtonClick` function is called with the correct slug, ensuring that interactions are correctly processed.

This should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the UI elements are correctly interactive and the simulation can proceed without errors.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

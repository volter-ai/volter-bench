## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title and buttons correctly positioned. However, the error message indicates a timeout, suggesting that the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to an issue with the layout or rendering logic that causes the simulator to hang.

### Analysis

1. **Layout and Positioning**: The layout seems correct visually, with the title at the top and buttons at the bottom. However, the use of `flex-grow` might be causing issues if the simulator expects a specific structure or timing for rendering.

2. **Rendering Logic**: The rendering logic for buttons is conditional based on `availableButtonSlugs`. If these are not set correctly or if the simulator expects a different state, it might cause a timeout.

3. **Flexbox Usage**: The use of `flex-grow` without a defined height for the container might cause unexpected behavior in some environments.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Ensure Consistent Layout**: Remove `flex-grow` and use a more predictable layout method to ensure the simulator can render the UI without issues.

2. **Check Button Logic**: Ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is correctly set and that the simulator can interact with the buttons as expected.

3. **Simplify Flexbox Usage**: Adjust the flexbox properties to ensure consistent rendering across different environments.

### Implementation

# Excerpt ID: e36ec553-0cae-43d0-b2cf-93d8364756ef
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="mt-auto mb-16">
                    {renderButtons()}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Layout Adjustment**: Removed `flex-grow` and used `mt-auto mb-16` to position the buttons at the bottom, ensuring consistent layout.
- **Button Logic**: Ensured that button rendering is based on `availableButtonSlugs`, which should be correctly set by the simulator.
- **Flexbox Simplification**: Adjusted flexbox properties to ensure predictable behavior across different environments.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can describe the issue and propose a solution:

1. Description of the problem:
The main issue appears to be that the UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds. This suggests that there might be an infinite loop or a long-running process preventing the component from rendering properly. However, the image shows that the component is actually rendering correctly, with the game title and buttons displayed as expected.

The rendered image matches the design document description, showing the game title prominently at the top and the play/quit buttons at the bottom. The background gradient is also visible as described in the code.

2. Proposed solution:
Since the component appears to be rendering correctly, the timeout issue might be related to how the UI simulator is interacting with the component rather than the component itself. However, we can make some optimizations to the code to potentially improve performance and reduce the chance of timeouts:

a. Memoize the renderButtons function to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
b. Use React.memo to optimize the MainMenuSceneView component.
c. Remove the unused props and interfaces to simplify the component.

3. Implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7dc63613-bcfb-4c5c-b788-d28a34e747d9
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

export const MainMenuSceneView = React.memo(() => {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = useMemo(() => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    }, [availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick]);

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="mt-auto mb-16">
                    {renderButtons}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
});

MainMenuSceneView.displayName = 'MainMenuSceneView';
```

These changes should help optimize the component's performance. However, if the timeout issue persists, it's likely that the problem lies outside of this component, possibly in the UI simulator itself or in how it's being called. In that case, further investigation into the UI simulator and its setup would be necessary to resolve the timeout error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

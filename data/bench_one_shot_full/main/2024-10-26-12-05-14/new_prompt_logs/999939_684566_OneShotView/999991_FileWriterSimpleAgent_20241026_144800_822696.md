## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two main sections: the top section for the game title and the bottom section for the buttons.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title using a large, bold text at the top of the screen. Since we don't have an actual image asset, we'll use styled text to represent the game title.

4. Buttons:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs from the useCurrentButtons hook to dynamically render the available buttons. Each button will be styled using Tailwind classes and will trigger the emitButtonClick function when clicked.

5. Background:
   We'll add a simple background color or gradient using Tailwind classes to give the main menu a more polished look.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

Now, let's implement the component:

# Excerpt ID: 445371ba-75a2-48e0-8e77-3f1508a22e1b
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] h-full max-h-[56.25vw] bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center">
            Awesome Game Title
          </h1>
        </div>
        <div className="mb-16">
          <p className="text-xl text-white mb-4">Welcome, {playerName}!</p>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
              <button
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                className="flex items-center justify-center bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
              >
                <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
              </button>
            )}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
              <button
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                className="flex items-center justify-center bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded"
              >
                <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
              </button>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a 16:9 aspect ratio, centered on the screen. It displays a large game title at the top and buttons at the bottom. The background uses a gradient for visual appeal. The component checks for available buttons and renders them accordingly, using Lucide icons for better visual representation.

The layout is responsive and will maintain its aspect ratio on different screen sizes. Error handling is implemented by using optional chaining for the player name and checking for button availability before rendering.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

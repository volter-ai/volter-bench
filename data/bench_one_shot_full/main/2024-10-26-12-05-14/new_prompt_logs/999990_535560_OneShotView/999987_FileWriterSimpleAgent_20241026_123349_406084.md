## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The main issue seems to be a timeout error during the UI simulation, which could be due to the UI not rendering as expected. From the image, the following observations can be made:

1. **Game Title Position**: The game title is correctly positioned at the top middle of the screen.
2. **Buttons Position**: The buttons are correctly positioned at the bottom middle of the screen.
3. **Player Name**: The player name is displayed as "Default Player," which suggests that the `display_name` is not being set correctly in the data passed to the component.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Data Input**: Ensure that the `display_name` is correctly set in the `GameUIData` passed to the component. This might be causing the default "Player" to be displayed.

2. **UI Adjustments**: Ensure that the UI elements are not causing any layout issues that might lead to a timeout. The current layout seems fine, but double-check the CSS for any potential issues.

3. **Timeout Handling**: If the UI is complex, consider simplifying it to ensure it renders within the timeout period.

### Code Implementation

Here's the revised code with a focus on ensuring the `display_name` is correctly set:

# Excerpt ID: 95abf13c-2810-4002-9201-a2684c7570ad
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
    display_name: string,
    description: string
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const player = props.data.entities.player;
    const playerName = player?.display_name || "Player";

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
            <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">Game Title</div>
            
            <div className="text-2xl text-white">
                Welcome, {playerName}!
                {player?.stats?.stat1 !== undefined && (
                    <div className="text-lg">Stat1: {player.stats.stat1}</div>
                )}
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid="play-button"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Play
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button 
                        uid="quit-button"
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-xl"
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-6 w-6" /> Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Data Verification**: Ensure that the `GameUIData` passed to the component has the correct `display_name` for the player.
- **UI Layout**: The layout is already correct, but ensure that the CSS does not have any hidden issues that could cause rendering delays.
- **Timeout Handling**: If the issue persists, consider checking the environment where the UI is being simulated for any performance bottlenecks.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The layout of the main menu is not as described in the design document. The game title and buttons are not properly positioned.
2. The background gradient is not filling the entire screen.
3. The buttons are not styled as described in the code (they appear as plain text instead of styled buttons).

These issues could be causing the timeout error because the UI is not rendering correctly, which might prevent the simulator from interacting with the elements as expected.

Proposed solution:

1. Adjust the layout to properly position the game title and buttons.
2. Ensure the background gradient fills the entire screen.
3. Fix the button styling to match the described appearance in the code.
4. Remove unnecessary padding and margin classes that might be affecting the layout.

Here's the implemented solution:

# Excerpt ID: 22b10129-2af3-4273-9063-43c8afb87527
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
    stats: Record<string, any>;
    meta: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const gameTitle = props.data?.display_name || "MainMenuScene";

    const buttonConfig = {
        play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
        quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
    };

    return (
        <Card className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white">
            <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mt-16">{gameTitle}</h1>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
                    if (!config) return null;

                    return (
                        <Button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-blue-600 px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors duration-200"
                        >
                            <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
                            <span>{config.label}</span>
                        </Button>
                    );
                })}
            </div>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Removed the `p-8` class from the main Card component to ensure the background fills the entire screen.
2. Changed the game title to use `props.data?.display_name || "MainMenuScene"` to match the image.
3. Kept the button styling as it was in the original code, as it should produce the desired appearance. The fact that it's not showing up correctly in the image suggests there might be a CSS issue outside of this component.
4. Maintained the layout structure with flex column and justification between for proper positioning of the title and buttons.

These changes should resolve the layout issues and ensure that the UI renders correctly, potentially fixing the timeout error in the simulator. If the problem persists, it may be necessary to investigate any global CSS styles or parent components that could be affecting this component's rendering.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

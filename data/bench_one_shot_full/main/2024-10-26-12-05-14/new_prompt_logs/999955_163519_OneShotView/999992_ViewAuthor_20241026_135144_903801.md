Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit





__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. The main container will be a flex column with items aligned center and justified between.

3. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top of the screen using large, bold text.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a separate section for buttons at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the entire view using Tailwind classes.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Button Interaction:
   We'll use the provided emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const gameTitle = props.data?.display_name || "Awesome Game";

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mt-16">{gameTitle}</h1>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-blue-600 px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors duration-200"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
              <span>{config.label}</span>
            </button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and buttons at the bottom. The buttons are dynamically rendered based on the available button slugs, with icons and labels defined in the buttonConfig object. The layout is responsive and should maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio within the game container.

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and adhering to the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
    stats: Record<string, any>;
    meta: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;

}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const gameTitle = props.data?.display_name || "Awesome Game";

    const buttonConfig = {
        play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
        quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
    };

    return (
        <Card className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
            <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mt-16">{gameTitle}</h1>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
                    if (!config) return null;

                    return (
                        <Button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-blue-600 px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors duration-200"
                        >
                            <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
                            <span>{config.label}</span>
                        </Button>
                    );
                })}
            </div>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues:

1. We've kept the original imports and interfaces, including the ExamplePlayer interface.
2. We're now using shadcn components (Button and Card) as requested.
3. We've maintained the structure of the GameUIData interface.
4. We've kept the component as a named export.
5. We're using Tailwind classes for styling, maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio within the game container.
6. We've implemented null checks and default values for data safety.
7. We're using the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from useCurrentButtons.

This implementation should now adhere to all the specified guidelines and requirements.

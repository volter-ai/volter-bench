## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The main issue with the current scene is that the buttons are not positioned at the bottom middle of the screen as specified in the design document. Instead, they are located just below the title at the top. This misplacement could be causing the UI simulator to fail due to layout constraints or expectations not being met.

### Proposed Solution

To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the layout so that the buttons are positioned at the bottom middle of the screen. This can be achieved by modifying the flex properties and ensuring the buttons are placed in a container that is aligned to the bottom.

### Code Changes

1. **Adjust Flex Properties**: Modify the `flex` properties to ensure the title is at the top and the buttons are at the bottom.
2. **Use `flex-grow`**: Add a `flex-grow` property to the title container to push the button container to the bottom.

### Implementation

Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: ad8aec3c-91f0-41e2-b5ef-5b26485060a0
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
    stats: Record<string, any>;
    meta: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const gameTitle = props.data?.display_name || "MainMenuScene";

    const buttonConfig = {
        play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
        quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
    };

    return (
        <Card className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white">
            <div className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-center">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mt-16">{gameTitle}</h1>
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
                    if (!config) return null;

                    return (
                        <Button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-blue-600 px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors duration-200"
                        >
                            <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
                            <span>{config.label}</span>
                        </Button>
                    );
                })}
            </div>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Flex Properties**: The `flex-grow` property is added to the title container to ensure it takes up the available space, pushing the button container to the bottom.
- **Layout Adjustment**: The `justify-between` property in the main container ensures that the title and buttons are spaced correctly, with the title at the top and buttons at the bottom.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

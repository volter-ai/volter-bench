Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
    stats: Record<string, any>;
    meta: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const gameTitle = props.data?.display_name || "MainMenuScene";

    const buttonConfig = {
        play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
        quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
    };

    return (
        <Card className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white">
            <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mt-16">{gameTitle}</h1>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
                    if (!config) return null;

                    return (
                        <Button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-blue-600 px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors duration-200"
                        >
                            <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
                            <span>{config.label}</span>
                        </Button>
                    );
                })}
            </div>
        </Card>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed: 
Error in main process: 364 | async function main() {
365 |     try {
366 |         await Promise.race([

368 |             new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => {

error: Timeout after 120s
at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The main issue with the current scene is that the buttons are not positioned at the bottom middle of the screen as specified in the design document. Instead, they are located just below the title at the top. This misplacement could be causing the UI simulator to fail due to layout constraints or expectations not being met.

### Proposed Solution

To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the layout so that the buttons are positioned at the bottom middle of the screen. This can be achieved by modifying the flex properties and ensuring the buttons are placed in a container that is aligned to the bottom.

### Code Changes

1. **Adjust Flex Properties**: Modify the `flex` properties to ensure the title is at the top and the buttons are at the bottom.
2. **Use `flex-grow`**: Add a `flex-grow` property to the title container to push the button container to the bottom.

### Implementation

Here's the updated code:

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
    stats: Record<string, any>;
    meta: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const gameTitle = props.data?.display_name || "MainMenuScene";

    const buttonConfig = {
        play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
        quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
    };

    return (
        <Card className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white">
            <div className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-center">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold mt-16">{gameTitle}</h1>
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
                    const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
                    if (!config) return null;

                    return (
                        <Button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                            className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-blue-600 px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition-colors duration-200"
                        >
                            <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
                            <span>{config.label}</span>
                        </Button>
                    );
                })}
            </div>
        </Card>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Flex Properties**: The `flex-grow` property is added to the title container to ensure it takes up the available space, pushing the button container to the bottom.
- **Layout Adjustment**: The `justify-between` property in the main container ensures that the title and buttons are spaced correctly, with the title at the top and buttons at the bottom.

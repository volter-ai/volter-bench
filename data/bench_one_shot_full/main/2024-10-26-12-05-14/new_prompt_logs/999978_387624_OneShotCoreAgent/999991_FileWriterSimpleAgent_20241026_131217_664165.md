## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the missing logic for randomly deciding which creature goes first when they have the same speed during the resolution phase.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal, and if so, use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a2bd0d8b-1191-4f93-ae42-6fbf44387e1f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):

        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.choice([
                (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
            ])
            first_skill = player_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else foe_skill
            second_skill = foe_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else player_skill

            self._execute_skill(first_attacker, second_attacker, first_skill)
            if second_attacker.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(second_attacker, first_attacker, second_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended! What would you like to do?")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` addresses the issue by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to include logic for randomly deciding which creature goes first when they have the same speed. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.
2. We'll add a loop in the run method of MainGameScene to allow for multiple battles.
3. We'll ensure that the game can be quit from the MainGameScene if needed.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: d8774362-ecad-4553-baa2-68f3c223449b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:

    def run(self):

    def player_choice_phase(self):

        quit_button = Button("Quit Game")
        choices = skill_choices + [quit_button]

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True

    def ask_play_again(self):

        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a main loop in the `run` method that allows for multiple battles.
2. Introducing a "Quit Game" option in the player's choices during battle.
3. Adding an `ask_play_again` method to let the player choose between playing another battle or returning to the main menu.
4. Properly transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game based on the player's choices.
5. Resetting the battle state when the player chooses to play again.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { User, UserMinus } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gray-100 flex flex-col">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <User className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-player-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <UserMinus className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-bot-creature.jpg"
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4 h-1/3 flex flex-col justify-between">
        <div className="flex-grow border border-gray-300 p-2 mb-2">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill') ? (
            <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
              {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick('use-skill', { skillId: skill.uid })}
                />
              ))}
            </div>
          ) : (
            <div className="text-center">
              <p className="text-lg">Waiting for your turn...</p>
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            className="w-full"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          >
            Quit
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Skill Buttons Visibility**: The skill button "Tackle" is visible, but the text area is not switching properly between displaying text and buttons. This might be due to incorrect logic in the conditional rendering of the skill buttons.

2. **Text Display**: The text "A wild creature appears!" is not integrated into the main UI area and seems to be floating outside the intended text-box area.

3. **Layout Issues**: The layout of the user interface area might not be correctly switching between the text and buttons, causing the text to appear outside the designated area.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Fix Conditional Rendering**: Ensure that the text and buttons are correctly toggled based on the game state. The text should only appear when no skills are available.

2. **Integrate Text Display**: Ensure that the text is displayed within the designated text-box area.

3. **Adjust Layout**: Make sure the layout is flexible enough to accommodate both text and buttons without overflow.

### Code Changes

- Adjust the conditional rendering logic to ensure the text and buttons are displayed correctly.
- Ensure the text is part of the main UI area.

### Rewritten Code

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { User, UserMinus } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gray-100 flex flex-col">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <User className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-player-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <UserMinus className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard

            imageUrl="/placeholder-bot-creature.jpg"
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4 h-1/3 flex flex-col justify-between">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill') ? (
          <div className="flex-grow border border-gray-300 p-2 mb-2 grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
            {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('use-skill', { skillId: skill.uid })}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex-grow border border-gray-300 p-2 mb-2 text-center">
            <p className="text-lg">A wild creature appears!</p>
          </div>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            className="w-full"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          >
            Quit
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Conditional Rendering**: The logic now ensures that the text "A wild creature appears!" is displayed only when no skills are available.
- **Text Integration**: The text is now part of the main UI area, ensuring it doesn't float outside the designated area.
- **Layout Adjustments**: The layout is adjusted to ensure proper display of text and buttons without overflow.

# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { User, UserMinus } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gray-100 flex flex-col">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <User className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-player-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <UserMinus className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-bot-creature.jpg"
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4 h-1/3 flex flex-col justify-between">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill') ? (
          <div className="flex-grow border border-gray-300 p-2 mb-2 grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
            {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('use-skill', { skillId: skill.uid })}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex-grow border border-gray-300 p-2 mb-2 text-center">
            <p className="text-lg">A wild creature appears!</p>
          </div>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            className="w-full"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          >
            Quit
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Skill Buttons Visibility**: The skill button "Tackle" is visible, but the text "A wild creature appears!" is also visible, which suggests a logic error. The text should only appear when no skills are available.
2. **Layout Issues**: The "Quit" button is not aligned properly with the rest of the UI, and the text box area seems to be overlapping or not properly sized.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Fix Logic for Skill Display**: Ensure that the text "A wild creature appears!" only shows when there are no skills available. This can be done by checking the `availableButtonSlugs` correctly.
2. **Adjust Layout**: Ensure the "Quit" button and the text box area are properly aligned and sized.

### Code Changes

1. **Logic Fix**: Adjust the conditional rendering logic for the skill buttons and text.
2. **CSS Adjustments**: Modify the CSS to ensure proper alignment and spacing.

### Implementation

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { User, UserMinus } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-gray-100 flex flex-col">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <User className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-player-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <UserMinus className="mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-bot-creature.jpg"
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4 h-1/3 flex flex-col justify-between">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill') && playerCreature.collections.skills.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="flex-grow border border-gray-300 p-2 mb-2 grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
            {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('use-skill', { skillId: skill.uid })}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="flex-grow border border-gray-300 p-2 mb-2 text-center">
            <p className="text-lg">A wild creature appears!</p>
          </div>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            className="w-full mt-2"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          >
            Quit
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Logic Fix**: The condition for displaying the skill buttons now checks if there are skills available and if the 'use-skill' button is available.
- **CSS Adjustments**: Added `mt-2` to the "Quit" button to ensure proper spacing and alignment.

## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

1. **Title Display**: The title is displaying the player's UID instead of the game title. The design document specifies that the game's title image should be displayed prominently, but the current implementation uses the player's UID as the title.

2. **Layout and Alignment**: The buttons are correctly placed at the bottom middle of the screen, but the title should be more prominent and centered at the top.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Title Fix**: Change the title to a static game title instead of using the player's UID. This will ensure the title is consistent with the design document.

2. **Layout Adjustments**: Ensure the title is centered at the top and the buttons are centered at the bottom.

### Code Changes

- Replace the dynamic title with a static game title.
- Adjust the layout to ensure the title and buttons are correctly positioned.

### Rewritten Code

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Title Change**: The title now displays "Game Title" instead of the player's UID, aligning with the design document.
- **Layout**: The layout remains the same, ensuring the title is at the top and buttons at the bottom, maintaining a clean and centered appearance.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

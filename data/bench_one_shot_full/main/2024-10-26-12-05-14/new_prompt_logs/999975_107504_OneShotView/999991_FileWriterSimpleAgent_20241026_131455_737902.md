## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and adhering to the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 56f61dd3-91c8-4fc9-a1b8-97198160eec2
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    {props.data.entities.player?.uid || "Game Title"}
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues and follows the guidelines:

1. We've kept the original interfaces (ExamplePlayer and GameUIData) as provided in the boilerplate.
2. We're using the shadcn Button component from "@/components/ui/button".
3. We've maintained the existing imports and named exports.
4. We're using the player's uid as the game title, with a fallback to "Game Title" if it's not available.
5. We've implemented null checks and used optional chaining for safer data access.
6. The layout uses Tailwind classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game.
7. The buttons are rendered based on the availableButtonSlugs.
8. We've used Lucide React icons as requested.

This implementation should now correctly follow the given guidelines and requirements while providing the main menu functionality as described in the VIEW_SUMMARY.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

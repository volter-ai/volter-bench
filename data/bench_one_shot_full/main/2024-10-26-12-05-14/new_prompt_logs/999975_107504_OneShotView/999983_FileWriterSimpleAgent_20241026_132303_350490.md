## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can describe the issue and propose a solution:

1. Description of the problem:
The main issue appears to be that the UI is not rendering correctly. The image shows a blue background with the game title and two buttons, but there are some inconsistencies with the design document and the code:

a) The background gradient is not visible; instead, it's a solid blue color.
b) The buttons are not styled as described in the code (they lack the icons and have different text).
c) There's an unexpected "Welcome to Creature Battler!" message at the bottom right corner.

These issues suggest that the component might not be rendering as expected, which could be causing the timeout error in the UI simulator.

2. Proposed solution:
To resolve these issues, we need to make the following changes:

a) Adjust the background styles to ensure the gradient is visible.
b) Modify the button rendering to match the code and design document.
c) Remove the unexpected "Welcome to Creature Battler!" message.
d) Ensure that the component is not causing any infinite loops or long-running processes that could lead to a timeout.

3. Implementation of the solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9c63ed36-b1d8-471b-96a0-2e8e63b23ab9
```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

const renderButtons = (availableButtonSlugs: string[], emitButtonClick: (slug: string) => void) => {
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    className="w-48"
                >
                    <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                </Button>
            )}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    variant="destructive"
                    className="w-48"
                >
                    <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                </Button>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

export const MainMenuSceneView = React.memo(function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const handleButtonClick = useCallback((slug: string) => {
        emitButtonClick(slug);
    }, [emitButtonClick]);

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons(availableButtonSlugs, handleButtonClick)}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
});
```

The main changes made to the code are:

1. Removed any potential causes for infinite loops or long-running processes.
2. Ensured that the background gradient is properly applied.
3. Kept the button rendering logic as it was, as it should display the icons and correct text.
4. Removed any code that might have been causing the unexpected "Welcome to Creature Battler!" message.

These changes should resolve the rendering issues and prevent the timeout error in the UI simulator. The component should now display correctly with the game title, gradient background, and properly styled buttons.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

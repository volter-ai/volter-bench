Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed: 
Error in main process: 364 | async function main() {
365 |     try {
366 |         await Promise.race([

368 |             new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => {

error: Timeout after 120s
at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can describe the issue and propose a solution:

1. Description of the problem:
The main issue appears to be that the UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds. This suggests that there might be an infinite loop or a long-running process preventing the component from rendering properly. However, the image shows that the component is actually rendering correctly, with the game title, play button, and quit button all visible and properly positioned.

The rendered image matches the expected layout described in the design document, with the game title at the top and the buttons at the bottom. The background gradient is also present as specified in the code.

2. Proposed solution:
Since the component appears to be rendering correctly, the timeout issue is likely not related to the component's visual representation. Instead, it may be caused by an issue in the game simulation or the way the component interacts with the game state.

To address this, we should focus on optimizing the component's performance and ensuring that it doesn't block the main thread or cause any unexpected delays. We can make the following changes:

a. Use React.memo to memoize the component and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
b. Move the renderButtons function outside of the component to prevent it from being recreated on each render.
c. Use useCallback for the button click handlers to maintain referential equality between renders.

3. Implementation of the proposed solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

const renderButtons = (availableButtonSlugs: string[], emitButtonClick: (slug: string) => void) => {
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    className="w-48"
                >
                    <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                </Button>
            )}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    variant="destructive"
                    className="w-48"
                >
                    <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                </Button>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

export const MainMenuSceneView = React.memo(function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const handleButtonClick = useCallback((slug: string) => {
        emitButtonClick(slug);
    }, [emitButtonClick]);

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons(availableButtonSlugs, handleButtonClick)}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
});
```

These changes should help improve the component's performance and reduce the likelihood of timeouts. However, if the issue persists, it may be necessary to investigate the game simulation logic or other parts of the application that interact with this component.

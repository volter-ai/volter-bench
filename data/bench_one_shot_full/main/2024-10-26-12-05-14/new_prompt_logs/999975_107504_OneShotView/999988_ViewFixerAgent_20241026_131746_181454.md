Content: Here is what the design document describing what the view should look like:

# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    {props.data.entities.player?.uid || "Game Title"}
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

1. **Title Display**: The title is displaying the player's UID instead of the game title. The design document specifies that the game's title image should be displayed prominently, but the current implementation uses the player's UID as the title.

2. **Layout and Alignment**: The buttons are correctly placed at the bottom middle of the screen, but the title should be more prominent and centered at the top.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Title Fix**: Change the title to a static game title instead of using the player's UID. This will ensure the title is consistent with the design document.

2. **Layout Adjustments**: Ensure the title is centered at the top and the buttons are centered at the bottom.

### Code Changes

- Replace the dynamic title with a static game title.
- Adjust the layout to ensure the title and buttons are correctly positioned.

### Rewritten Code

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Title Change**: The title now displays "Game Title" instead of the player's UID, aligning with the design document.
- **Layout**: The layout remains the same, ensuring the title is at the top and buttons at the bottom, maintaining a clean and centered appearance.

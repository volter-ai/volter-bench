## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can describe the issue and propose a solution:

1. Description of the problem:
The main issue appears to be that the UI simulator is timing out after 120 seconds. This suggests that there might be an infinite loop or a long-running process preventing the component from rendering properly. However, the image shows that the component is actually rendering correctly, with the game title, play button, and quit button all visible and properly positioned.

The rendered image matches the expected layout described in the design document, with the game title at the top and the buttons at the bottom. The background gradient is also present as specified in the code.

2. Proposed solution:
Since the component appears to be rendering correctly, the timeout issue is likely not related to the component's visual representation. Instead, it may be caused by an issue in the game simulation or the way the component interacts with the game state.

To address this, we should focus on optimizing the component's performance and ensuring that it doesn't block the main thread or cause any unexpected delays. We can make the following changes:

a. Use React.memo to memoize the component and prevent unnecessary re-renders.
b. Move the renderButtons function outside of the component to prevent it from being recreated on each render.
c. Use useCallback for the button click handlers to maintain referential equality between renders.

3. Implementation of the proposed solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import React, { useCallback } from "react";
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

const renderButtons = (availableButtonSlugs: string[], emitButtonClick: (slug: string) => void) => {
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                    className="w-48"
                >
                    <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                </Button>
            )}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                <Button
                    onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                    variant="destructive"
                    className="w-48"
                >
                    <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                </Button>
            )}
        </div>
    );
};

export const MainMenuSceneView = React.memo(function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const handleButtonClick = useCallback((slug: string) => {
        emitButtonClick(slug);
    }, [emitButtonClick]);

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons(availableButtonSlugs, handleButtonClick)}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
});
```

These changes should help improve the component's performance and reduce the likelihood of timeouts. However, if the issue persists, it may be necessary to investigate the game simulation logic or other parts of the application that interact with this component.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom, which matches the design document. However, the error indicates a timeout, suggesting that the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to an issue with the `useCurrentButtons` hook or the `emitButtonClick` function not being triggered correctly.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check `useCurrentButtons` Hook**: Ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is populated correctly. If it's empty or not updating, the buttons won't render or respond correctly.

2. **Verify `emitButtonClick` Function**: Ensure that `emitButtonClick` is being called with the correct slug. If the function is not working as expected, it could cause the simulator to hang.

3. **Adjust Layout**: Ensure that the layout is not causing any elements to be off-screen or hidden, although this seems correct based on the image.

### Code Implementation

# Excerpt ID: d9ca9515-3f67-406c-90cb-86971b695342
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
                    <Button
                        key={slug}
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                        {getButtonText(slug)}
                    </Button>
                ))}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **`useCurrentButtons` Hook**: Ensure this hook is correctly implemented and returns the expected `availableButtonSlugs`.
- **`emitButtonClick` Function**: Verify that this function is correctly emitting the button slugs.
- **Layout**: The layout seems correct based on the image, so no changes are needed there.

This solution should address the timeout issue by ensuring that the buttons are correctly rendered and responsive. If the problem persists, further investigation into the hook and function implementations may be necessary.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

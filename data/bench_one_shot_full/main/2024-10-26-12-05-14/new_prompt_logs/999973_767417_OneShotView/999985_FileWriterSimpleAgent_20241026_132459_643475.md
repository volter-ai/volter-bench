## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title and buttons correctly positioned. However, the error indicates a timeout, suggesting the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to an issue with the layout or rendering logic that causes the simulator to hang.

### Analysis

1. **Layout and Positioning**: The layout seems correct visually, with the title at the top and buttons at the bottom. However, the use of `flex-grow` might be causing unexpected behavior in some environments, potentially leading to the timeout.

2. **Rendering Logic**: The rendering logic for buttons is conditional based on `availableButtonSlugs`. If this array is empty or not properly populated, it might cause the simulator to hang.

3. **Flexbox Usage**: The use of `flex-grow` might be unnecessary and could be causing issues with the layout rendering, especially if the simulator expects a more straightforward layout.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Remove `flex-grow`**: This property is not needed for the current layout and might be causing issues with the simulator.

2. **Ensure `availableButtonSlugs` is populated**: Verify that this array is correctly populated before rendering buttons.

3. **Simplify Layout**: Ensure the layout is straightforward to avoid any potential rendering issues.

### Implementation

# Excerpt ID: 1df11fcf-5791-4e5e-a50d-2eae1ca41496
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Removed `flex-grow`**: This simplifies the layout and avoids potential issues with the simulator.
- **Ensured Button Rendering**: The logic for rendering buttons remains the same, but ensure `availableButtonSlugs` is correctly populated before running the simulator.
- **Simplified Layout**: The layout is straightforward, reducing the chance of rendering issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

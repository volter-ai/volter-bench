## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title and buttons correctly positioned. However, the error message indicates a timeout, suggesting that the UI simulator might not be interacting with the buttons as expected. This could be due to the buttons not being recognized or not being clickable within the simulation environment.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Ensure Buttons are Recognizable and Clickable:**
   - Verify that the buttons are correctly rendered and accessible. The current code seems to handle this, but we should ensure that the buttons are not being obstructed or misconfigured.

2. **Check Button Visibility and Interaction:**
   - Ensure that the buttons are visible and not covered by other elements. The `z-index` or positioning might need adjustment if they are not clickable.

3. **Adjust Layout for Better Simulation:**
   - Ensure the layout is conducive to interaction by the simulator. This might involve checking the flex properties and ensuring the buttons are not pushed off-screen.

### Code Implementation

# Excerpt ID: 6469117a-2846-4f73-b06f-a54d939fc0e6
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 items-center">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    Game Title
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-center">
                    {renderButtons()}
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

- **Centered Buttons:** Ensured the buttons are centered and visible by adjusting the flex properties.
- **Flex Grow Adjustment:** Added a `flex-grow` container to ensure the buttons are centered vertically, which might help the simulator recognize them better.
- **Alignment Fixes:** Ensured the buttons are aligned properly with `items-center` to prevent any potential layout issues.

These changes should help ensure that the UI simulator can interact with the buttons without timing out.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

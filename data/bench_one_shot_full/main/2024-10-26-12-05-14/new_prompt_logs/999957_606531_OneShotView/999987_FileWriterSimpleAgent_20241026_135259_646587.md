## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The main issue is a timeout error in the UI simulator, which suggests that the UI might not be rendering or responding as expected. From the image, the layout seems correct, with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom. However, the timeout error could be due to the `availableButtonSlugs` not being populated correctly, causing the `emitButtonClick` function to not trigger any actions.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check `useCurrentButtons` Hook**: Ensure that `useCurrentButtons` is correctly providing `availableButtonSlugs`. If this hook is not returning the expected data, the buttons will not function, leading to a timeout.

2. **Ensure Button Rendering**: Verify that `availableButtonSlugs` is not empty. If it is, the buttons will not render, causing the UI to be unresponsive.

3. **Debugging**: Add console logs to check the values of `availableButtonSlugs` and ensure they are being set correctly.

### Code Implementation

# Excerpt ID: 14f52415-dd94-4a79-b14c-30152f503774
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    // Debugging: Log availableButtonSlugs to ensure they are populated
    console.log("Available Button Slugs:", availableButtonSlugs);

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
                    availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
                        <Button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                            className="w-48"
                        >
                            {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                            {getButtonText(slug)}
                        </Button>
                    ))
                ) : (
                    <div>No buttons available</div>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Console Logging**: Added a console log to check the `availableButtonSlugs` to ensure they are being set correctly.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Added a conditional check to render a message if no buttons are available, which helps in debugging and understanding the UI state.
- **No Changes to Interfaces**: Ensured no changes were made to interfaces or imports, adhering to the constraints.

This solution should help identify if the issue is with the data being passed to the component, which is likely causing the timeout error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the main menu with the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom, which matches the design document. However, the error message indicates a timeout issue, suggesting that the UI simulator is not completing its task within the expected time. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **Button Visibility**: The buttons are visible, but if the `availableButtonSlugs` array is empty, the buttons won't render, causing the simulator to wait indefinitely.
2. **Event Handling**: If `emitButtonClick` is not functioning correctly, the simulator might not detect button clicks, leading to a timeout.
3. **Layout Issues**: If elements are not properly aligned or are off-screen, it might cause unexpected behavior, but this doesn't seem to be the case here.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check `availableButtonSlugs`**: Ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is populated correctly. If it's empty, the buttons won't render, causing the simulator to timeout.
2. **Verify `emitButtonClick`**: Ensure that `emitButtonClick` is correctly called with the appropriate slug.
3. **Debugging**: Add more console logs to verify the flow of data and events.

### Code Implementation

# Excerpt ID: 658e4298-198c-4e7e-ad93-a62f66c2bfbb
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons();

    // Debugging: Log availableButtonSlugs to ensure they are populated
    console.log("Available Button Slugs:", availableButtonSlugs);

    const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
        switch (slug) {
            case 'play':
                return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            case 'quit':
                return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
            default:
                return null;
        }
    };

    const getButtonText = (slug: string) => {
        return slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1);
    };

    return (
        <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 bg-gray-800 text-white">
            <div className="text-4xl font-bold mt-16">
                Game Title
            </div>
            
            <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
                {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
                    availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
                        <Button
                            key={slug}
                            onClick={() => {
                                console.log(`Button clicked: ${slug}`);
                                emitButtonClick(slug);
                            }}
                            className="w-48"
                        >
                            {getButtonIcon(slug)}
                            {getButtonText(slug)}
                        </Button>
                    ))
                ) : (
                    <div>No buttons available</div>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Console Logs**: Added logs to ensure `availableButtonSlugs` is populated and to track button clicks.
- **Event Handling**: Verified that `emitButtonClick` is called with the correct slug.
- **UI Layout**: The layout seems correct, so no changes were made there.

This should help identify if the issue is with data flow or event handling, which could be causing the timeout.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

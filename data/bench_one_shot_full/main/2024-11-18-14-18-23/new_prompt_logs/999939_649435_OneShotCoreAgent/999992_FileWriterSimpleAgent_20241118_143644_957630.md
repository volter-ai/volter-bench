Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that Player requires an active_creature but it's not being set during initialization. Looking at the error:
# Excerpt ID: f39eca6a-bb29-4a9a-a40b-9ba9b82cc441
```
ValidationError: {'active_creature': ["constructor for Player is missing variable `active_creature=<class 'main_game.models.Creature'>`"]}
```

The solution:
- We need to set active_creature in the player.json prototype data
- The active_creature should be set to the first creature in the list
- This follows the engine's pattern where all model data should come from prototypes
- This keeps models as pure data schemas without methods
- The scene doesn't need to set active_creature since it will come from the prototype

2. Here's the fixed player.json:

# Excerpt ID: c2c2108e-c7f5-473c-8736-dd06f2517efb
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The default player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

This fix:
- Follows the engine's pattern where all data comes from prototypes
- Keeps models as pure data schemas
- Properly initializes the Player with all required fields
- Maintains separation of concerns - data in JSON, logic in scenes
- Works with the engine's automatic deserialization of prototype IDs to objects

The models.py file doesn't need to change since it's already correctly defining the schema. The issue was in the data, not the model definition.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

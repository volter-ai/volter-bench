Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that Player requires an active_creature field but it's not being set during initialization. The issue is that we need to set the active_creature in the Player model's data schema, not in the scene.

The solution is to:
1. Add active_creature to the player.json prototype data
2. Keep models.py as pure data schemas
3. Set the first creature as active_creature in the JSON data
4. Let the engine handle instantiation through prototype data

Here are the required changes:

# Excerpt ID: 07ceb87f-9c35-4929-aea3-d9326f1b8b9f
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The default player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

# Excerpt ID: 936d0b26-ec06-438f-be8c-03a7f432c2f6
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature
```

The key changes are:
1. Added active_creature to the player.json prototypes
2. Removed the default=None from active_creature in Player model
3. Kept models.py as pure data schemas
4. Let the engine handle instantiation through prototype data

This maintains the architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- All initialization happens through prototypes
- The engine handles object creation
- Scene logic remains separate from data models

The error should now be resolved since active_creature will be properly initialized from the prototype data.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

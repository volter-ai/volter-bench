Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being provided in the JSON data. Since `active_creature` is marked as optional (Creature | None), we need to properly initialize it as None in the model definition using Field(default=None).

This follows the engine's pattern where optional fields should be explicitly marked with Field(default=None) in the model schema.

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 96143067-a8f2-41b4-aabc-e849b50e283c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

The key change is:
- Added `= Field(default=None)` to `active_creature` in Player model to properly handle the optional field
- This tells the engine's validation system that active_creature can be None by default
- Maintains pure data schema approach while fixing the validation error
- Keeps the same functionality where active_creature gets set during gameplay

This should resolve the validation errors in the tests while staying within the engine's architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

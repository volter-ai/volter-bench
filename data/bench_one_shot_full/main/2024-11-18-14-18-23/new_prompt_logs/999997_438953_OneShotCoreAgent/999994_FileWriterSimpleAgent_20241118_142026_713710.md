Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me describe how to fix this issue:

1. Analysis:
- The architecture docs specify that creature state should be reset when transitioning out of MainGameScene
- We need to reset HP back to max_hp before transitioning
- This should happen in MainGameScene before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
- Since models are pure data schemas, we can directly modify the hp attribute

2. Solution:
- Add a _reset_creatures method to MainGameScene that restores creatures to full HP
- Call this method before transitioning in both win and loss cases
- This maintains pure data models while handling state reset in the scene

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 73ef0f96-12be-4d0d-9309-e2f49e6db63a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Battle start!")

        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            bot_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _handle_player_turn(self, current_player, creature):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills
        ]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        # Reset both player and bot creatures to full HP
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()  # Reset before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()  # Reset before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
            return True
        return False
```

The changes:
1. Added _reset_creatures method to handle resetting creature HP
2. Called _reset_creatures before each transition in _check_battle_end
3. Maintains pure data models by only modifying attributes
4. Follows the architecture requirement to reset state before transitioning

This solution ensures creatures are restored to full health before returning to the main menu, while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining proper separation of concerns.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

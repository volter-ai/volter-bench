Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or lose), it just breaks from the loop without calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must explicitly transition to another scene or quit the game.

The fix is simple: after a battle ends, we should transition back to the MainMenuScene. This maintains the game flow where players can:
- Start at menu
- Play a battle
- Return to menu to either play again or quit
- Quit from menu

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run` method where we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends. This maintains the proper scene flow required by the engine and fixes the test failure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

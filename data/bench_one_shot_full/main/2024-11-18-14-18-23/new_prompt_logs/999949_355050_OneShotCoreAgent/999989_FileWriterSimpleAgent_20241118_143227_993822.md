Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the MainGameScene test isn't properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception. When the battle ends, it transitions to MainMenuScene, which then calls _quit_whole_game(), but this exception needs to be caught in the test.

The fix is to update the test file to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception, similar to how we handle TransitionFromScene and RandomModeGracefulExit. This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene flow.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 97c42f46-dda6-445a-b496-c2cd3ee171be
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"exiting via random mode counter")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print("exiting via quit whole game")
            else:
                print("battle completed normally")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Improved logging to show how the test exits

This maintains all architectural requirements while properly handling the game flow where:
- Battle scene runs
- Transitions to menu when complete
- Menu can quit game
- Test properly catches all expected exit conditions

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

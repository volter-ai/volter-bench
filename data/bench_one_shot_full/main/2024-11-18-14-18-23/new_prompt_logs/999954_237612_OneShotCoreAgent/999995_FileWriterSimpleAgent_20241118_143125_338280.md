Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp back to max_hp directly in the scene initialization

This follows the architecture principle that all game logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the fixed files:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Moved the reset logic directly into MainGameScene's `__init__`
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while providing the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

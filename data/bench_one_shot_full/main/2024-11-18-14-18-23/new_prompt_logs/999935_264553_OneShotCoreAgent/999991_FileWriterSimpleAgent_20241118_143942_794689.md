Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in MainGameScene's resolve_turn method where we handle same-speed situations. Currently, when creatures have equal speed, it always defaults to the bot going first. According to the architecture, we should use random.choice to randomly select which player goes first in a speed tie.

The fix is simple:
1. In the resolve_turn method, when handling attacks, we'll modify the speed comparison logic
2. When speeds are equal, we'll use random.choice to randomly select which player goes first
3. This maintains the pure data model approach since we're only changing scene logic

Here's the fixed file:

        return False
```

The key changes are in the resolve_turn method:
1. Explicitly compare speeds and store them in variables for clarity
2. Add a specific case for equal speeds that uses random.choice
3. Keep the rest of the logic the same, just determining 'first' and 'second' based on the new speed comparison logic

This maintains the architecture's requirements while fixing the speed tie issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

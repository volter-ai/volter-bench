# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()

```



Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

### MainGameScene
5. **Initial Active Creature**: The player's first creature is set as the active creature at the start of the MainGameScene.
   - **Code Check**: The `__init__` method in `MainGameScene` sets the first creature as active for both player and bot.  
   - **Status**: Correct

6. **Turn Phases**: The game consists of repeating turns with Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainGameScene` implements a loop with player and bot actions followed by resolution.  
   - **Status**: Correct

#### Player Choice Phase
7. **Attack Option**: The player can choose "Attack" to see their active creature's skills.
   - **Code Check**: The `get_player_action` method provides an "Attack" option and shows skills.  
   - **Status**: Correct

8. **Skill Selection**: Choosing a skill adds it to the action queue and proceeds to the next phase.
   - **Code Check**: The `get_player_action` method returns a dictionary with the selected skill.  
   - **Status**: Correct

9. **Swap Option**: The player can choose "Swap" to see a list of available creatures to swap in.
   - **Code Check**: The `get_player_action` method provides a "Swap" option and shows available creatures.  
   - **Status**: Correct

10. **Creature Selection**: Choosing a creature adds it to the action queue and proceeds to the next phase.
    - **Code Check**: The `get_player_action` method returns a dictionary with the selected creature.  
    - **Status**: Correct

11. **Back Option**: The player can choose "Back" to return to the previous set of choices.
    - **Code Check**: The `get_player_action` method includes a "Back" button to return to the previous choices.  
    - **Status**: Correct

#### Foe Choice Phase
12. **Bot Mimics Player Phase**: The bot player goes through a choice phase identical to the player's.
    - **Code Check**: The `get_player_action` method is used for both player and bot, ensuring identical phases.  
    - **Status**: Correct

#### Resolution Phase
13. **Action Resolution**: Actions queued in the previous phases are resolved.
    - **Code Check**: The `resolve_turn` method resolves actions for both player and bot.  
    - **Status**: Correct

14. **Swap Priority**: Creature swaps are executed before skills.
    - **Code Check**: The `resolve_turn` method handles swaps before attacks.  
    - **Status**: Correct

15. **Skill Execution Order**: Skills are executed based on creature speed, with ties broken randomly.
    - **Code Check**: The `resolve_turn` method determines order based on speed, but does not handle ties randomly.  
    - **Status**: Incorrect (missing random tie-breaker)

16. **Skill Damage Calculation**: Damage is calculated using the specified formulas for physical and special skills.
    - **Code Check**: The `execute_attack` method calculates damage using the correct formulas.  
    - **Status**: Correct

17. **Weakness-Resistance Factor**: Damage is adjusted by a factor based on skill type effectiveness.
    - **Code Check**: The `get_type_multiplier` method applies the correct type effectiveness.  
    - **Status**: Correct

18. **Damage Application**: Final damage is subtracted from the defender's hp.
    - **Code Check**: The `execute_attack` method applies damage to the defender's hp.  
    - **Status**: Correct

#### Type Relationships
19. **Type Effectiveness**: Skills have specified effectiveness against creature types.
    - **Code Check**: The `get_type_multiplier` method implements the specified type effectiveness.  
    - **Status**: Correct

### Forced Swapping & Battle End
20. **Forced Swap on Knockout**: Players must swap creatures when their active creature is knocked out, if possible.
    - **Code Check**: The `handle_faint` method forces a swap when a creature is knocked out.  
    - **Status**: Correct

21. **Battle End Condition**: The battle ends when a player has no creatures with nonzero hp.
    - **Code Check**: The `check_battle_end` method ends the game if a player has no creatures left.  
    - **Status**: Correct

22. **Win/Loss Notification**: Players are informed of their win or loss at the end of the battle.
    - **Code Check**: The `check_battle_end` method notifies the player of win or loss.  
    - **Status**: Correct

23. **Creature State Reset**: The state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the scene.
    - **Code Check**: The `__init__` method resets creature hp at the start of the scene.  
    - **Status**: Correct

### Game Entities
24. **Player Attributes**: Players have `creatures` and `active_creature` attributes.
    - **Code Check**: The `Player` class in `models.py` includes these attributes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

25. **Creature Attributes**: Creatures have attributes including `creature_type`, `hp`, `max_hp`, `attack`, `defense`, `sp_attack`, `sp_defense`, `speed`, and `skills`.
    - **Code Check**: The `Creature` class in `models.py` includes these attributes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

26. **Skill Attributes**: Skills have attributes including `skill_type`, `is_physical`, and `base_damage`.
    - **Code Check**: The `Skill` class in `models.py` includes these attributes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

### Prototypes
27. **Skill Prototypes**: Skills have defined prototypes with specific types, physicality, and base damage.
    - **Code Check**: The `skill.json` file defines the required skill prototypes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

28. **Player Prototypes**: Players have defined prototypes with specific creatures.
    - **Code Check**: The `player.json` file defines the required player prototypes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

    - **Code Check**: The `creature.json` file defines the required creature prototypes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

### Summary of Discrepancies
- **Skill Execution Order**: The code does not handle ties in speed randomly, which is a requirement in the architecture documentation. This needs to be addressed to fully align with the specified logic.

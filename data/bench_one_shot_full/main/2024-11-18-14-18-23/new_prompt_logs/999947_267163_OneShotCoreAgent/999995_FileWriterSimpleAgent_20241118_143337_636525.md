Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the issues:

1. First error: `AssertionError: _wait_for_choice was called with no choices`
- This happens in MainGameScene when trying to get bot actions
- The issue occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to
- We need to handle this case by not offering the "Swap" option if there are no valid swap targets

2. Second error: `Scene terminated without calling quit_whole_game or transition_to_scene`
- The scene ends naturally when the battle is over but doesn't transition anywhere
- We need to transition back to MainMenuScene or quit_whole_game when the battle ends

Solution:
1. In MainGameScene:
- Only show "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
- When battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene
- Add proper scene transitions for game end states

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

Key changes made:
1. Only show "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Added transition back to MainMenuScene when battle ends
3. Improved choice handling to prevent empty choice lists
4. Maintained all engine requirements and architecture patterns

The changes ensure:
- No empty choice lists are passed to _wait_for_choice
- Scene properly transitions when ending
- Game flow remains intact
- All engine capabilities are respected
- Models remain pure data schemas

This should resolve both test failures while maintaining the game's functionality and architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py. The test is failing because when MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, and MainMenuScene calls quit_whole_game(), the _QuitWholeGame exception is not being caught in the test.

The test needs to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions, since both are valid ways for the scene to end during random testing.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7df9d565-fd5b-4de4-8e1e-7a30d22c0b72
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game quit gracefully via main menu")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added informative print message for quit case

This maintains all architectural requirements while properly handling both ways the random test can end:
- RandomModeGracefulExit when counter reaches 0
- _QuitWholeGame when battle ends and main menu quits

The test will now pass since it properly catches both expected exit conditions while maintaining the engine's architecture and capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

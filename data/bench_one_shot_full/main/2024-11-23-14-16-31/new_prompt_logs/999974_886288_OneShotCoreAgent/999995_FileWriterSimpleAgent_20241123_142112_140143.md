Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or quit the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, show the result message
2. Then transition back to MainMenuScene to allow the player to play again or quit
3. This creates a proper game loop where the player can keep playing matches or choose to quit

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 22268154-fdb6-4452-a405-900a8a364f34
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(

                    # Instead of breaking, transition back to menu
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        if action1[1].speed > action2[1].speed:

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        type_multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_multiplier)
        final_damage = max(1, final_damage)  # Minimum 1 damage

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {final_damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Instead of breaking from the loop when battle ends, we now transition back to MainMenuScene
2. Added return statements after transitions to ensure clean scene exit
3. This maintains proper scene flow control as required by the engine

The scene will now properly transition back to the menu after each battle, allowing the player to play again or quit, fixing the FixableException error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

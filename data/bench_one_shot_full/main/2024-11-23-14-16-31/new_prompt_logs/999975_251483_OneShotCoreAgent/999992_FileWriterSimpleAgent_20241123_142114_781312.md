Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how the main.py handles it by catching the exception.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py which passes, we can see we need to:
- Mock the quit_whole_game method to prevent the exception
- Mock any scene transitions
- Catch expected exceptions (RandomModeGracefulExit, TransitionFromScene)

The solution is to update test_main_game_scene.py to properly handle scene termination by:
- Mocking _quit_whole_game
- Creating a custom exception for scene transitions
- Catching all expected exceptions

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 77fd5726-d49a-4f2f-aa35-3365a4c53a60
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Mock both ways to exit the scene
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via quit, ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_quit.called, "scene did not exit as expected"
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and TransitionFromScene
2. Mocked _quit_whole_game to raise a custom exception we can catch
3. Added assertions to verify the scene exits properly
4. Added cleanup in finally block
5. Maintained the same test structure as test_main_menu_scene.py

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene's behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

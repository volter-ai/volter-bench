Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue with equal speed creatures not having random order resolution.

The issue is in MainGameScene's resolve_turn method. Currently, it sorts actions purely by speed, but according to the architecture doc:
"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The fix is simple - we'll modify the sort key to include a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal. This stays within the engine's capabilities since we're just using Python's random module.

Here's the complete fixed file:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added speed_with_tiebreaker function that returns a tuple of (speed, random_tiebreaker)
2. Modified the sort to use this function as the key
3. When speeds are equal, the random tiebreaker (0-0.99) determines order
4. No changes to models or other architectural components were needed

This implements the random order resolution for equal speed creatures while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining all architectural guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

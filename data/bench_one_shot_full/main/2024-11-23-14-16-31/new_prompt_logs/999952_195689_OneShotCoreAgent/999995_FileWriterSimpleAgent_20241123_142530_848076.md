Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (either player wins or loses), we're just returning from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when we detect the battle has ended, we should transition back to MainMenuScene instead of just returning. This follows the engine's pattern of always explicitly transitioning between scenes or quitting.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` before each return in the run() method
2. This ensures we always transition back to the main menu when the battle ends
3. No other changes were needed since this was just a scene flow issue

This follows the engine's pattern of explicit scene transitions and should fix the test failure while maintaining all the architectural guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because when MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, and MainMenuScene chooses "Quit", the QuitWholeGame exception is not being caught in the test.

The solution is to catch the QuitWholeGame exception in the test, similar to how we catch RandomModeGracefulExit. This follows the engine's pattern where QuitWholeGame is an expected exception that should be caught when testing scenes that might transition to MainMenuScene.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 41d7cec4-1ade-4911-96d5-005834cca0cd
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game quit gracefully via main menu")
```

The changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added descriptive print message when game quits

This maintains all architectural guidelines while properly handling the expected quit behavior when testing the battle scene. The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the scene can end:
1. Via RandomModeGracefulExit when random moves are exhausted
2. Via _QuitWholeGame when transitioning to main menu and choosing quit

No changes to models or other architectural components were needed since this was purely a test handling issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in strict dependency order:
- Skill (no dependencies)
- Creature (depends on Skill)
- Player (depends on Creature)

2. Create JSON files for each model with the prototypes:
- skill.json with "Tackle" 
- creature.json with "Bubwool"
- player.json with "default_player"

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene)
- MainGameScene (needs to handle battle phases)

4. Create tests for both scenes using random mode

Key considerations:
- Models will be pure data schemas
- All references between models will be direct type references
- Scene logic will handle all game mechanics
- Will use proper transitions between scenes
- Will treat bots exactly like players
- Will use proper prototype loading

Let me implement each file:

```

This implementation:
1. Follows proper model dependency order
2. Uses direct type references between models
3. Keeps models as pure data schemas
4. Properly handles scene transitions
5. Treats bots exactly like players
6. Uses proper prototype loading
7. Implements the battle mechanics as specified
8. Includes proper random testing for both scenes

The game flow works as follows:
1. Player starts at MainMenuScene
2. Can choose to play or quit
3. If play is chosen, transitions to MainGameScene
4. Battle proceeds in turns with player and bot phases
5. Battle continues until one creature is defeated
6. Returns to main menu after battle ends

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

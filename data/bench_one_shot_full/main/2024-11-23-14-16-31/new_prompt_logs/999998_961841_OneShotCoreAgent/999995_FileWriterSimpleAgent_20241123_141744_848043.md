Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp back to max_hp directly in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 1dbf6c94-00b4-4f59-9a70-c5fe12445ad1
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

# Excerpt ID: f3b23d85-1397-4478-b6ea-4a6470231da2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.bot_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )

            # Bot choice phase
            self._show_text(self.bot, "Your turn!")
            self.bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution phase
            # Player's skill
            skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills 
                        if s.display_name == self.player_choice.display_name)
            self.bot_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, 
                f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            # Bot's skill
            skill = next(s for s in self.bot_creature.skills 
                        if s.display_name == self.bot_choice.display_name)
            self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player,
                f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Moved the reset logic directly into MainGameScene's run() method
3. Simply set hp = max_hp at the start of battle

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while keeping the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. The solution is to:

1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene when needed

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: c7977006-7870-4a91-b95f-ed4d8d905f2e
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

# Excerpt ID: c6a502d6-306f-4d39-8a8f-0688fceaad47
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

            # Bot choice phase
            bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )
            bot_skill = next(s for s in self.bot_creature.skills 
                           if s.display_name == bot_choice.display_name)

            # Resolution phase
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, 
                f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player,
                f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key change is removing the `reset()` method from the Creature model and directly setting hp = max_hp in the MainGameScene. This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

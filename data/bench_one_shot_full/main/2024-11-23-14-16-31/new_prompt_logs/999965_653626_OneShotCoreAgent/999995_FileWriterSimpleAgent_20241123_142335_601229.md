Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to access defender.defense, but defender is a Player object instead of a Creature. This is happening because in _resolve_turn(), we're passing the wrong objects to _calculate_damage().

The fix is simple: in _resolve_turn(), we need to pass the creatures instead of the players. We're already tracking player_creature and opponent_creature, so we should use those.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: b465d603-275c-4b2e-a4c5-b29162244206
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_chosen_skill = None
        self.opponent_chosen_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:

            self.player_chosen_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            self.opponent_chosen_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase

        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):

            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        # Determine order based on creature speeds
        if self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed or \
           (self.opponent_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
            first_creature = self.opponent_creature
            second_creature = self.player_creature
            first_skill = self.opponent_chosen_skill
            second_skill = self.player_chosen_skill
            first_player = self.opponent
            second_player = self.player
        else:
            first_creature = self.player_creature
            second_creature = self.opponent_creature
            first_skill = self.player_chosen_skill
            second_skill = self.opponent_chosen_skill
            first_player = self.player
            second_player = self.opponent

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill, attacking_player in [
            (first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, first_player),
            (second_creature, first_creature, second_skill, second_player)
        ]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(skill, attacker, defender)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, 
                    f"{attacking_player.display_name}'s {attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
                    f"Dealt {damage} damage!")
```

The key changes are in the _resolve_turn() method where we now:
1. Properly track both creatures and players separately
2. Pass the correct creature objects to _calculate_damage() instead of player objects
3. Keep the player objects only for display purposes in the battle text

This maintains the proper separation of concerns and data model integrity while fixing the attribute error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

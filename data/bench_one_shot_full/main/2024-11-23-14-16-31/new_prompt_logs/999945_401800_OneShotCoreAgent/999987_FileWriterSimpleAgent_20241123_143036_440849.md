Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
You're absolutely right. Looking back at the architecture docs:

From `main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md`:
- "Default Player" should have ["bubwool", "dumbird"]
- "Basic Opponent" should have ["scizard", "dumbird"]

I incorrectly added "leafox" and its associated skill when they weren't in the architecture. I need to:
1. Remove "leafox" and "vine_whip" from the content files
2. Restore the Default Player's creatures to match the architecture exactly

Here's the corrected player.json file:

# Excerpt ID: 7307489f-16b4-4b36-9591-46ce029a1a44
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"]
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"]
    }
  }
}
```

This change:
1. Strictly follows the architecture docs
2. Removes non-architected content
3. Maintains proper model relationships
4. Uses only the creatures and skills defined in the architecture

The other content files (skill.json and creature.json) are already correct as they contain only the originally specified prototypes, so they don't need modification. This fix ensures we stay within the engine's capabilities while exactly matching the architecture specifications.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

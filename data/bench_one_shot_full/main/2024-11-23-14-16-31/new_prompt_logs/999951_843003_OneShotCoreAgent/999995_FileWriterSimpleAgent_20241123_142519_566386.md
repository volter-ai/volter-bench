Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with an empty list of choices. Looking at the test output, this happens during creature swapping when all creatures are knocked out. The issue is in MainGameScene's get_player_action method - when trying to swap creatures, if there are no valid creatures to swap to (all are knocked out), we create an empty choices list.

The fix should:
1. Check if there are any valid creatures to swap to before offering the "Swap" option
2. Only show "Swap" as a choice if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Keep the battle logic and model structure intact
4. Stay within engine capabilities by using only _wait_for_choice and _show_text

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added get_available_creatures helper method
2. Modified get_player_action to only show valid choices
3. Improved scene string to indicate swap availability
4. No changes to models or engine interaction
5. Maintains pure data model approach

This should resolve the empty choices list error while keeping the game's functionality intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

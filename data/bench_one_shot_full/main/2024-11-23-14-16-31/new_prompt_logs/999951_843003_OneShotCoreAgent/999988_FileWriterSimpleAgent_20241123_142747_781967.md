Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Plan:

The issues to fix are:
- Add "Back" option in player choice menus
- Implement random speed tie resolution
- Add forced creature swapping when knocked out
- Reset creature state when leaving scene

The solution will:
1. Modify choice phases to include "Back" options
2. Add random speed tie resolution in resolve_actions
3. Add forced swap logic after creature knockout
4. Reset creature states when transitioning back to menu
5. Keep all models as pure data schemas
6. Stay within engine capabilities using _wait_for_choice and _show_text

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" options at all choice levels
2. Added random tiebreaker for equal speeds
3. Added forced swap logic when creatures are knocked out
4. Added state reset when battle ends
5. Improved battle status display
6. Kept all models as pure data
7. Used only engine-provided methods

The implementation now fully matches the architecture while staying within engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win/loss), we need to either:
- Transition back to MainMenuScene, or 
- Call quit_whole_game

Looking at the test output, we can see battles are happening and ending ("You won the battle!") but the scene just returns instead of properly transitioning. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always explicitly transition or quit.

The fix should:
1. Modify MainGameScene to properly transition after battle ends
2. Keep all game logic intact
3. Stay within engine capabilities using _transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game
4. Not modify any models

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added transition back to MainMenuScene after battle ends
2. Kept all game logic intact
3. Used proper engine transition method
4. No changes to models or other architecture
5. Maintains pure data model approach

This should resolve the scene termination error while keeping the game's functionality intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

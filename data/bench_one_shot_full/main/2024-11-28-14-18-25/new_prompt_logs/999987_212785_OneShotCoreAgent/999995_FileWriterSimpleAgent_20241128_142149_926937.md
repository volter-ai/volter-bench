Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead of having a reset method in the Creature model, we should:
1. Move all logic to scenes
2. Handle hp reset directly in the MainGameScene
3. Simply set hp = max_hp in the scene code

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 830399dc-ce9b-42c5-a675-893202163a69
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And the corresponding scene change (though you only asked for the file that needs fixing, I'll include the relevant scene change for completeness):

# Excerpt ID: 0a25e9b8-0314-42bf-b85b-9738963e42a3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild bot appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self.handle_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self.handle_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_skills(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def handle_turn(self, current_player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def resolve_skills(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!\n"
            f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
```

The key change is removing the `reset()` method from the Creature model and instead directly setting `hp = max_hp` in the scene code. This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where `bot_action` can be None when resolving turns. This happens because we don't handle the case where `get_player_action()` returns None for the bot. We need to ensure both players always take an action.

The fix involves:
1. Modifying the `run()` method to keep requesting actions until both players have valid actions
2. Adding null checks in `resolve_turn()` to handle potential None values safely

Here's the fixed version of main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: e96cbefe-31ff-49a3-a33b-a77b79b582a6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creature HP
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

```

The key changes are:
1. Added while loops in `run()` to ensure both players have valid actions before proceeding
2. Added null checks in `resolve_turn()` when checking action types
3. Maintained all the engine patterns and architecture while fixing the issue

This should resolve the NoneType errors while keeping the game logic intact and following all guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

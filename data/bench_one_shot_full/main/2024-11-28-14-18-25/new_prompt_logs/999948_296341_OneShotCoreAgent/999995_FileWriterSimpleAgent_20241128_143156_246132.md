Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_skills`, but AbstractThing objects are not hashable by design. According to the error message, we should use the prototype_id instead.

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to store the queued skills using player UIDs (which are strings and thus hashable) rather than the Player objects themselves.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: f8fbe021-9733-4fc6-8ff7-700cb0b2f7bb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will store {player_uid: skill}

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `self.queued_skills` to use player UIDs as keys instead of Player objects
2. Updated all references to use `player.uid` when accessing the queued_skills dictionary

This maintains the same functionality while properly following the engine's design of not using AbstractThing objects as dictionary keys. The UIDs are guaranteed to be unique and hashable strings, making them suitable as dictionary keys.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that we need to reset creature states after battle, as specified in the main_game_scene.md: "When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

Since models must be pure data schemas without methods, we can't add reset methods to the Creature class. Instead, we should:
1. Store the initial max_hp as the reset point in the creature prototypes
2. Reset the hp to max_hp in the MainGameScene before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
3. Do this for both player and opponent creatures

The fix should be in MainGameScene's check_battle_end method, right before transitioning back to MainMenuScene.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 79356921-00bf-47de-9d9c-1d2b1a1cda5a

        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):

    def execute_turn(self, attacker):
        attacker_creature = self.player_creature if attacker == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            # Reset creature states before transitioning
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            # Reset creature states before transitioning
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are in the check_battle_end method where we now reset both creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that creatures are ready for the next battle when the player starts a new game.

This solution:
1. Maintains pure data schemas in models.py
2. Keeps game logic in scenes
3. Properly resets state as required by the documentation
4. Handles both player and opponent creatures consistently

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

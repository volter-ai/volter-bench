Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows two related problems:
- MainGameScene ends without calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`
- The tests fail because neither transition method is called

The issue is in MainGameScene's handling of game end conditions. When a creature's HP reaches 0, we show the victory/defeat message but don't properly exit the scene. According to the engine architecture, every scene must end by either:
- Transitioning to another scene using `_transition_to_scene`
- Ending the game using `_quit_whole_game`

Solution:
I'll modify MainGameScene to properly end the scene when the battle concludes by calling `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the victory/defeat message. This follows the game design where the battle is the final scene.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: b0ff6799-0e9a-4a1c-bb47-b05de63a95ef
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )

            # Opponent Choice Phase
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Choose your skill!")
            self.opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.opponent,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

                if self.check_victory(): 
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                    return
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                if self.check_victory():
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                    return
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
                    if self.check_victory():
                        self._quit_whole_game()
                        return
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                else:
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                    if self.check_victory():
                        self._quit_whole_game()
                        return
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            
            if self.check_victory():
                self._quit_whole_game()
                return

    def execute_turn(self, attacker, defender):
        skill = attacker.skills[0]  # Since we only have tackle
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def check_victory(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` after each victory condition check
2. Added `return` statements after `_quit_whole_game()` to ensure the scene properly exits
3. Maintained all the same battle logic but now properly ends the scene when victory conditions are met

This ensures the scene always ends properly through one of the engine's approved methods, fixing both test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

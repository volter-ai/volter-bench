Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that MainGameScene is terminating without properly ending the game flow. When the battle ends (win or loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly calling _quit_whole_game() or transitioning to another scene.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when check_battle_end() returns true (meaning someone won/lost), we should call _quit_whole_game() instead of just returning. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly end via transition or quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` before returning when no valid action is available
2. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` before returning when battle ends
3. Kept all other logic the same since it was working correctly

This ensures the scene always ends properly according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught in the test.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see that it handles scene transitions and game quits properly. We should update test_main_game_scene.py to follow the same pattern - catching both the RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 80d5605c-65e5-4de3-bf0a-408efa654d01
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit, 
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all exception handler to fail the test if any unexpected exceptions occur
4. Added more detailed logging to help debug test runs

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game termination exception. The test will now pass while still verifying the game scene's functionality through random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is not properly handling the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception. The test should catch this exception since it's an expected way for the game to end. The random testing is working correctly - it's playing through multiple battles and menu transitions until eventually hitting "Quit" in the main menu, which raises the expected exception.

Let me fix the test file:

# Excerpt ID: 3f4015d5-7b09-4404-84f3-d14a6be88459
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The changes:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access the `_QuitWholeGame` exception
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added a catch-all handler that re-raises unexpected exceptions
4. Added print statements to help debug test runs

This fix:
- Properly handles the expected game quit exception
- Maintains the random testing functionality
- Keeps all the game logic intact
- Stays within the engine's capabilities
- Doesn't modify any models or core game logic

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways a random test run can end:
1. When the random mode counter hits zero (RandomModeGracefulExit)
2. When the random choices lead to quitting the game (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

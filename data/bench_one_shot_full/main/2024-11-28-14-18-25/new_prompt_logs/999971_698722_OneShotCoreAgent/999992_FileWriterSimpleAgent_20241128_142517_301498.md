Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions. This is happening because:

- The scenes are transitioning between each other (MainMenu -> MainGame -> MainMenu)
- Eventually the random choices lead to "Quit" in MainMenu
- The _QuitWholeGame exception is raised but not caught in the test

The fix is to:
1. Update test_main_game_scene.py to catch both exceptions
2. Add proper mocking of transitions to prevent infinite scene loops
3. Keep track of scene transitions to ensure the test actually tests the MainGameScene

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 41f7f7a6-44bb-4b73-85b3-c7c759aa0837
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch the transition to prevent infinite scene loops
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene):
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 or game quit. Ending run {i}")
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned successfully. Ending run {i}")
                else:
                    raise AssertionError("Scene did not end in an expected way")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added catching of AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added mocking of _transition_to_scene to prevent infinite scene loops
3. Added TransitionFromScene exception to detect proper scene completion
4. Added assertion to ensure scene ends in expected way
5. Improved error messages for debugging

This maintains all the game logic while properly testing the MainGameScene in isolation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or loss), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine architecture, every scene must end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

Solution:
- After a battle ends (win or loss), we should return to the main menu using `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`
- This maintains the game flow and follows the engine's requirements
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: f33becfb-e474-460b-9b9c-10ac52179b30
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.opponent_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )

            # Opponent Choice Phase
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Choose your skill!")
            self.opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.opponent,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution Phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.check_win(): 
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                if self.check_win():
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
                    if self.check_win():
                        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                        return
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                else:
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                    if self.check_win():
                        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                        return
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            
            if self.check_win():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def execute_turn(self, attacker, defender):
        skill = attacker.skills[0]  # Since we only have tackle
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def check_win(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` whenever the battle ends
2. Added `return` statements after transitions to properly exit the scene
3. Maintained all the existing battle logic
4. Kept the scene's interface with models unchanged

This ensures the scene always ends properly according to the engine's requirements while maintaining the game's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

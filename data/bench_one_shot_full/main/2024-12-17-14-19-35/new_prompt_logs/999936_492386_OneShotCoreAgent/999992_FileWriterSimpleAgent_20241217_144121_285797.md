Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly handling its game loop and scene transitions. The error indicates that the scene is terminating without calling either `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`. 

The main problems are:
1. The game loop isn't properly structured to continue until a proper exit condition
2. The battle end condition isn't properly transitioning to the next scene
3. We need to ensure the scene always exits through proper transition methods

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added proper `_end_battle` method that always transitions to MainMenuScene
2. Modified run loop to properly handle end conditions
3. Ensured all exit paths use `_transition_to_scene`
4. Added proper handling of None returns from action methods
5. Separated battle end check from scene transition logic

This should fix the test failures by ensuring the scene always exits through proper transition methods rather than just returning or breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help fix this issue. The error occurs because we added methods (`reset`) to the data models, which violates the pure data schema requirement.

1. Solution Description:
- Remove all methods from models.py (Creature.reset() and Player.reset())
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- The scene will handle resetting HP values when initializing the battle
- This maintains pure data models while keeping the same functionality

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 06185aa6-d0f7-4a19-a4f4-21e87e5c536d
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And we need to update the MainGameScene to handle the reset logic:

# Excerpt ID: f35382ed-a123-4fa2-a10e-fd0f5d040ba0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random
from typing import Tuple, Optional

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures' HP to max_hp
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    # ... rest of the file remains the same ...
```

This change:
1. Removes methods from data models, making them pure schemas
2. Moves the reset logic to the scene where game logic belongs
3. Maintains the same functionality while following the engine's architecture requirements

The error should now be resolved since we're no longer adding methods to data models.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The error occurs in `_resolve_turn` when checking `second[1].active_creature.hp`. The issue is that `second[1]` is a Skill object, but we're trying to access `active_creature` on it. This is incorrect - we should be checking the player's active creature's HP, not the skill's.

The fix:
- In `_resolve_turn`, we need to check the defender's active creature HP after the first attack
- We already have the attacker/defender relationship set up in `_execute_attack`
- We should restructure the attack resolution to properly track who is defending

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed `_determine_order` method and integrated its logic directly into `_resolve_turn`
2. Fixed the turn resolution to properly track the defender after the first attack
3. Check the defender's active creature HP instead of trying to access it through the skill
4. Maintained all the same game logic and functionality while fixing the bug

This maintains the architecture and stays within engine capabilities while fixing the bug.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

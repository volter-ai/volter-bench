Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game`

In our case, when the battle ends, we should return to the MainMenuScene. This maintains the game loop and follows proper scene transition patterns.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added transition back to MainMenuScene when battle ends
2. Added explicit return after transition to prevent the scene from continuing
3. Maintained all game logic and functionality
4. Follows engine requirements for proper scene transitions

This ensures the scene properly ends by transitioning back to the main menu rather than just terminating.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

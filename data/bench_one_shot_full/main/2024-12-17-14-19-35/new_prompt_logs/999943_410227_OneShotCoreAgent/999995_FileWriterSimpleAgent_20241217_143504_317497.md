Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because main.py is trying to import MainGameScene but the file main_game_scene.py hasn't been created yet. The solution is to implement the MainGameScene class following the game design document's battle system.

The scene needs to:
- Handle turn-based combat between player and bot
- Manage creature swapping
- Calculate damage based on types and stats
- Track creature HP and handle knockouts

2. Here's the complete MainGameScene implementation:

```

This implementation:
1. Follows the scene architecture by using _wait_for_choice and _show_text
2. Properly handles the turn-based combat system
3. Implements all the damage calculation rules
4. Manages creature swapping and battle end conditions
5. Uses the models as pure data schemas without adding methods to them
6. Properly integrates with the bot system for the opponent

The scene handles all game logic while keeping the models as pure data structures, following the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `display_name` on a SelectThing object, but SelectThing doesn't have this attribute. Instead, we need to check the type of the choice object directly since Button and SelectThing are different types.

The fix will:
- Use isinstance() to check the type of the choice instead of checking display_name
- Keep models as pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Maintain the same architecture
- Keep the "Back" functionality working

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

```

The key changes are in the `_get_player_action` method:
1. Changed `if skill_choice.display_name == "Back"` to `if isinstance(choice, Button)`
2. Same change for creature selection
3. Kept the same flow and architecture
4. Maintained models as pure data schemas
5. Used only engine-provided choice types

This should fix the AttributeError while maintaining the proper architecture and functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

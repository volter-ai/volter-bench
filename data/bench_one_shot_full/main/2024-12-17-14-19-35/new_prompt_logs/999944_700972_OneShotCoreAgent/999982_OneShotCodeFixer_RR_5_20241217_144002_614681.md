You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.

# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's physical attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to physical attacks.
- `sp_attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's non-physical attacks.
- `sp_defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to non-physical attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `is_physical` - A boolean indicating whether the skill is a physical skill or a non-physical (special) skill.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
- `active_creature` - The player's creature that is currently on the field and participating in battle.

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (base damage, type, physical/special)
- Creature (stats, type, skills collection)
- Player (creatures collection, active creature)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json - Tackle, Fireball, Lick skills
- creature.json - Bubwool, Scizard, Dumbird creatures
- player.json - Default Player and Basic Opponent

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene - Welcome message, Play/Quit options
- MainGameScene - Battle logic with phases:
  - Player Choice (Attack/Swap)
  - Foe Choice (Bot makes choice)
  - Resolution (Calculate damage, handle KOs)

4. Create tests:
- test_main_menu_scene.py
- test_main_game_scene.py

Here's the implementation:

Role: assistant
Content: 1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because main.py is trying to import MainGameScene but the file main_game_scene.py hasn't been created yet. We need to implement the MainGameScene class that handles the battle logic.

The scene needs to:
- Initialize with both players (human and bot)
- Handle turn phases (player choice, foe choice, resolution)
- Calculate damage based on type effectiveness
- Handle creature swapping and KOs

This implementation:
1. Follows the engine's architecture by using AbstractGameScene
2. Uses the proper choice mechanisms (Button, SelectThing)
3. Implements all battle mechanics from the requirements
4. Properly handles turn order based on speed
5. Calculates damage according to the formulas
6. Handles creature swapping and knockouts
7. Returns to main menu when battle ends

The scene integrates with the existing models and uses them as pure data schemas without adding methods to them.

Content: 1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene when trying to swap creatures. The `_wait_for_choice` is being called with an empty list of choices, which happens when there are no available creatures to swap to. This occurs in `_get_player_action` when the player chooses "Swap" but has no valid creatures to swap to.

The fix needs to:
1. Only show the "Swap" option if there are actually creatures available to swap to
2. Keep the code within the engine's capabilities
3. Maintain models as pure data schemas
4. Handle the case where a player has no swap options properly

```

The key changes are:
1. In `_get_player_action`, we now check if there are available creatures before adding the "Swap" option
2. We store the available_creatures list to avoid recalculating it
3. We maintain the same architecture and keep models as pure data schemas
4. We ensure choices lists are never empty when calling `_wait_for_choice`

This should fix the test failure while maintaining the proper architecture.

Content: 1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the choice phases as specified in the documentation. According to the docs:

> When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

To fix this, I will:
1. Add a "Back" button to the skill selection and creature swap menus
2. Modify `_get_player_action` to handle recursive choice selection
3. Use the engine's Button class for the "Back" option
4. Keep all models as pure data schemas
5. Stay within the engine's capabilities

Here's the fixed implementation:

Key changes:
1. Added a while loop in `_get_player_action` to handle navigation
2. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
3. Used continue to return to the main menu when "Back" is selected
4. Maintained pure data schemas in models
5. Used only engine-provided Button and SelectThing for choices
6. Kept the same architecture and flow, just added navigation capability

This implementation now fully matches the documentation requirements while staying within the engine's capabilities.

Role: assistant
Content: 1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `display_name` on a SelectThing object, but SelectThing doesn't have this attribute. Instead, we need to check the type of the choice object directly since Button and SelectThing are different types.

The fix will:
- Use isinstance() to check the type of the choice instead of checking display_name
- Keep models as pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Maintain the same architecture
- Keep the "Back" functionality working

```

The key changes are in the `_get_player_action` method:
1. Changed `if skill_choice.display_name == "Back"` to `if isinstance(choice, Button)`
2. Same change for creature selection
3. Kept the same flow and architecture
4. Maintained models as pure data schemas
5. Used only engine-provided choice types

This should fix the AttributeError while maintaining the proper architecture and functionality.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The code generally aligns well with the architecture documentation, with the exception of the random choice for equal speed creatures, which is not implemented. This discrepancy should be addressed to fully comply with the architecture.",
  "qa_result": "failed"
}



Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Content: 1. Solution Description:
The issue is that when creatures have equal speed, we're not implementing the random choice for turn order as specified in the documentation:

> If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

I'll fix this by:
- Adding a speed comparison check in the run method
- Using random.choice when speeds are equal to determine turn order
- Keeping all models as pure data schemas
- Staying within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        # Reset creature HPs

The key changes are in the `run` method:
1. Added explicit speed comparison
2. Added random choice for equal speeds using random.choice
3. Maintained the same architecture and flow
4. Kept models as pure data schemas
5. Used only engine-provided capabilities

This implementation now fully complies with the architecture documentation regarding speed ties.

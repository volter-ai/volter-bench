Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Description:
The issue is that when creatures have equal speed, we're not implementing the random choice for turn order as specified in the documentation:

> If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

I'll fix this by:
- Adding a speed comparison check in the run method
- Using random.choice when speeds are equal to determine turn order
- Keeping all models as pure data schemas
- Staying within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

```

The key changes are in the `run` method:
1. Added explicit speed comparison
2. Added random choice for equal speeds using random.choice
3. Maintained the same architecture and flow
4. Kept models as pure data schemas
5. Used only engine-provided capabilities

This implementation now fully complies with the architecture documentation regarding speed ties.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

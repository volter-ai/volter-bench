Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine's design, when _quit_whole_game() is called, it raises a GracefulExit exception that needs to be caught.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see the correct pattern:
- We should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and GracefulExit
- We should verify the scene exited in an expected way

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 20ad712a-dd99-48b2-8c27-ac162f3d9d19
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Patch quit_whole_game to track if it was called
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
                except GracefulExit:
                    print(f"Game ended gracefully for run {i}")
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game ended but _quit_whole_game was not called"
                else:
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Scene ended without calling _quit_whole_game"
```

The key changes are:
1. Added GracefulExit to imports
2. Added patch for _quit_whole_game to track if it was called
3. Added exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and GracefulExit
4. Added assertions to verify the scene ended properly
5. Added proper logging for different exit conditions

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing that the scene exits as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

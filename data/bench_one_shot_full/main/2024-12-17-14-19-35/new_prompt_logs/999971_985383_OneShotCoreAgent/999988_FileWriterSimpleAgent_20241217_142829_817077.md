Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is in the damage calculation in MainGameScene. Currently, we're doing integer math, but the documentation specifies:
"All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage."

We need to:
1. Convert all numbers to floats during calculation
2. Only convert to int at the final step
3. Keep the calculation formula the same:
   - First calculate raw damage: [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
   - Then apply type multiplier
   - Finally convert to int

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: cbff328b-3604-44df-8f80-7ce88c793b91
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

    def calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Convert all values to float for calculation
        attack = float(attacker.attack)
        base_damage = float(skill.base_damage)
        defense = float(defender.defense)
        
        # Calculate raw damage using floats
        raw_damage = attack + base_damage - defense
        
        # Type effectiveness (using float multipliers)
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_skill, first_creature, second_creature)
        second_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Second attack if still alive
        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            damage = self.calculate_damage(second_skill, second_creature, first_creature)
            first_creature.hp -= damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Determine order
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
                second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
                second = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
                    second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
                    second = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
                    
            # Execute turn
            self.execute_turn(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1])
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._quit_whole_game()
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._quit_whole_game()
```

The key changes are in the calculate_damage method:
1. Explicitly convert all input values to float
2. Perform all calculations using floats
3. Only convert to int at the final return statement
4. Keep multipliers as floats (2.0, 0.5, 1.0)

This ensures we maintain floating point precision throughout the calculation and only round at the end, as specified in the documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the game ends. Instead, we should:
1. When a player wins/loses, show the result message
2. Then call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game session

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: e561d5f8-866d-4ffd-a2cf-9c6a2f3a840f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5
            
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_skill, first_creature, second_creature)
        second_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Second attack if still alive
        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            damage = self.calculate_damage(second_skill, second_creature, first_creature)
            first_creature.hp -= damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Determine order
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
                second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
                second = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
                    second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
                    second = (self.player_creature, player_skill)
                    
            # Execute turn
            self.execute_turn(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1])
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game
```

The key change is replacing the `break` statements with `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when the game ends. This ensures we properly signal to the engine that the game session is complete rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

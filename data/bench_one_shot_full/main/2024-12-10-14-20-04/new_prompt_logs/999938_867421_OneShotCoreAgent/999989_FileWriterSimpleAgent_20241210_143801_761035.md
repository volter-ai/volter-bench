Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the error message, this exception is expected and should be caught. Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly catches GracefulExit (the parent class of _QuitWholeGame).

The fix is to modify test_main_game_scene.py to:
- Catch GracefulExit (which includes _QuitWholeGame)
- Follow the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py
- Keep the random testing approach
- Stay within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 2c8c905e-4677-4319-b4d7-ed62fed8d1b3
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except GracefulExit:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene did not exit properly")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for GracefulExit
2. Added exception handler for GracefulExit
3. Added else clause to ensure scene always exits properly
4. Kept the same random testing approach
5. Follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py

This maintains all architectural requirements while properly handling the expected graceful exit from the game engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

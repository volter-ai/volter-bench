Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is returning directly instead of properly ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`. According to the error message and engine guidelines, scenes must always end by either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, rather than just returning. This follows the architecture since:
- The engine explicitly requires proper scene termination
- We're using the provided scene control methods
- The game flow remains logical - when a battle ends, the whole game should end

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 84ccbd2b-3751-41d6-b3db-f675f104a9ae

        super().__init__(app, player)

        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` before each return in the run() method
2. This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning
3. The game now properly ends after a battle concludes, following the engine's requirements

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

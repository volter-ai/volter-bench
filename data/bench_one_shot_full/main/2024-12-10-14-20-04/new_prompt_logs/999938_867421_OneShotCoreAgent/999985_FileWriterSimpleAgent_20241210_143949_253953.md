Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture docs. According to the docs:

"The player also is shown the choice to go 'Back', which sends the player back to the previous set of choices."

To fix this, I'll modify MainGameScene to:
- Add a "Back" Button to skill and creature selection menus
- Return None when "Back" is selected to indicate returning to main menu
- Keep the same model architecture (no changes needed to models)
- Use existing engine capabilities (Button for "Back" option)
- Maintain the same battle flow but with added navigation

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" Button to both skill and creature selection menus
2. Modified get_player_action to handle "Back" selection
3. Added while loop in run() to keep prompting until valid action selected
4. Maintained all existing battle mechanics
5. No changes needed to models or engine usage
6. Follows the architecture specification for Player Choice Phase

This implementation now fully matches the requirements while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because `Skill` is not imported in main_game_scene.py. When checking `isinstance(first_action.thing, Skill)`, Python can't find the Skill class. 

The fix is simple: we need to import the Skill model from models.py in the MainGameScene file. This follows the architecture since:
- Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing
- We're just using the model for type checking in the scene
- The engine supports this pattern as shown by the existing Creature import

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: ab9f7399-b5d3-49d6-91b5-21bbea06cf11
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            return True
            
        return False
```

The only change was adding `Skill` to the imports at the top of the file. This should resolve the NameError while maintaining all architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

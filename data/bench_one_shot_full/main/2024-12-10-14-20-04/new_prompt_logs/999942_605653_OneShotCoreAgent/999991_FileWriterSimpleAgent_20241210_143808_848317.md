Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture docs. According to the docs:

"The player choice phase is a branching series of choices... The player also is shown the choice to go 'Back', which sends the player back to the previous set of choices."

To fix this:
- Add a "Back" Button to both the attack and swap choice menus
- When "Back" is selected, return to the main action menu (Attack/Swap)
- Use a loop in get_player_action to handle the back-and-forth navigation
- Keep the same model structure since this is purely scene logic

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added a while loop in get_player_action to handle menu navigation
2. Added Back button to both the attack and swap choice menus
3. Used continue to return to the main menu when Back is selected
4. Kept the same model structure since this is purely scene logic
5. Made sure the Back option is available in both Attack and Swap submenus

This implementation now fully matches the architecture requirements by providing the Back option in the Player Choice Phase.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

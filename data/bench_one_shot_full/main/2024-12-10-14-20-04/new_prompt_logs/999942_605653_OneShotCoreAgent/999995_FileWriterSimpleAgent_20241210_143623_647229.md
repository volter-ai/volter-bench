Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The errors indicate two related problems:
- The MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting
- The tests are failing because neither transition nor quit is being called

The issue is in the MainGameScene's battle end logic. When a player wins/loses, we're just returning from the run() method instead of properly ending the scene by calling _quit_whole_game().

According to the engine architecture:
- Scenes must always end with either a transition or quit
- We shouldn't just return from run()
- The battle scene is the final scene, so we should quit the game when it ends

2. Solution:
I'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end by calling _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends, rather than just returning. This follows the engine's requirements for proper scene termination.

Here's the complete fixed file:

            new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(player, creature_choices).thing

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed the run() method to properly call _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends
2. Changed the return None in get_player_action() to continue the game loop instead of ending it
3. Made sure the scene always ends with a proper quit call

This should fix both test failures by ensuring the scene always ends properly through the engine's expected mechanisms.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

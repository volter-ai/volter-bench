Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_skills`, but AbstractThing objects are not hashable by design (they raise an exception if you try to hash them). According to the error message, we should use the prototype_id instead.

The fix is to modify the MainGameScene to store the queued skills using player UIDs (which are strings and thus hashable) instead of the Player objects themselves. This stays within the engine's capabilities and follows the architecture.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 5bcdf3cc-466f-4628-8b00-fb66a350b5a8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            self.opponent_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            if self.resolution_phase():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = choice.thing

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid] = choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        # Determine order based on speed
        first = self.player
        second = self.opponent
        if self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first, second = second, first
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

        # Execute skills
        for attacker in [first, second]:
            defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature if attacker == self.player else self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
            
            skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]
            damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
            defender_creature.hp -= max(0, damage)
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                winner = attacker.display_name
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner} wins!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return True

        self.queued_skills.clear()
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.player]` to `self.queued_skills[self.player.uid]`
2. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.opponent]` to `self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid]`
3. Changed `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker]` to `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]`

This fix:
- Uses string UIDs as dictionary keys instead of AbstractThing objects
- Maintains the same functionality
- Follows the engine's design by using prototype_ids/uids for identification
- Keeps models as pure data schemas
- Doesn't require any changes to the models or other parts of the architecture

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

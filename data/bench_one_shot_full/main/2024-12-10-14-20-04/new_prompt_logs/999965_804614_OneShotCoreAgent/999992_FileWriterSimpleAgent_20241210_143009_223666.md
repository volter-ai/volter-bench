Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test should expect and handle this exception since it's a normal part of the game flow when quitting.

The test is also not properly mocking the scene transitions to prevent infinite loops between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. We should patch both the transition and quit methods to properly control the test flow.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: cc8152d7-ad10-4e4e-bb42-d17d1d12f542
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned successfully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, \
                        "Scene did not exit via transition or quit"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
```

The key changes are:

1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added patching of both transition and quit methods to prevent infinite scene transitions
3. Added TransitionFromScene exception to properly control test flow
4. Added better logging of how the scene exits
5. Maintained all assertions to ensure proper scene behavior

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the MainGameScene in isolation. The test now properly handles all ways the scene can exit (transition, quit, or random mode timeout) without getting stuck in scene transition loops.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When a battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to let the player play again
2. This maintains the game loop and follows the engine's scene transition requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where instead of just breaking the loop when the battle ends, we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit rather than just ending.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
You're right - I'll fix this issue. Looking at the architecture docs, there's no mention of a "Leaf" type in the skill prototypes. The only types defined are:
- "normal" (Tackle)
- "fire" (Fireball) 
- "water" (Lick)

I need to modify the MainGameScene to only handle these three types in its type effectiveness calculations.

Here's the fixed scene file:

# Excerpt ID: 08dadf32-f393-480f-bb09-1d574cb94c36
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "normal":
            # Normal type has no effectiveness modifiers
            multiplier = 1.0
        elif skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": 
                multiplier = 0.5  # Fire is weak against water
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": 
                multiplier = 2.0  # Water is strong against fire

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)
        second_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Second attack if still alive
        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
            first_creature.hp -= damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_choices)
            player_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if skill.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_skill_choices)
            opponent_skill = next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills 
                                if skill.display_name == opponent_choice.display_name)

            # Resolution phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
            elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)

            self.execute_turn(*first)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes:
1. Removed all references to the "leaf" type
2. Simplified type effectiveness to only handle the documented types:
   - Normal type does neutral damage to everything
   - Fire does half damage to water
   - Water does double damage to fire

This aligns with the skill prototypes defined in the architecture docs and maintains the type effectiveness system with just the documented types.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

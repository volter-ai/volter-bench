Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference `player_action` which is not in scope. The issue is that we're trying to determine if the current action belongs to the player or bot by comparing it to a variable that doesn't exist.

The fix:
Instead of comparing the whole action tuple, we should pass in the owner of the action along with the action itself. This maintains clean separation of concerns and avoids scope issues. We'll modify the resolve_actions and execute_action methods to handle action ownership explicitly.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Modified resolve_actions to take tuples of (actor, action) instead of just actions
2. Updated get_action_order to work with these tuples
3. Changed execute_action to take actor and action as separate parameters
4. Removed the problematic comparison with player_action
5. Made the action ownership explicit throughout the battle system

This maintains the same functionality while fixing the scope issue and making the code more maintainable. The changes are contained within the scene file and don't require modifications to the models or engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:

The issues identified require fixes to the MainGameScene:

a) Add "Back" option:
- Add a "Back" button to attack/swap choice menus
- Return to main choice menu when "Back" is selected
- Implement using nested choice loops

b) Random speed tie resolution:
- Add random selection when speeds are equal
- Modify the sort key to include a random tiebreaker
- Keep the logic in the scene file

c) Reset creature state:
- Add a method to reset creatures to max HP
- Call this when leaving scene (before quit)
- Keep data model pure by only modifying values

2. Here's the fixed scene file:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button and handling in choice menus
2. Added random tiebreaker for speed ties in resolve_turn
3. Added reset_creatures_state method called before quitting
4. Maintained pure data models
5. Kept all game logic in scene
6. Used engine capabilities properly
7. Followed architecture requirements

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where `get_swap_choice` can be called with no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all non-active creatures are knocked out (hp <= 0). 

The fix should:
1. Check if there are valid creatures before offering the "Swap" choice
2. Only show "Attack" if swapping isn't possible
3. Keep the scene logic in the scene file
4. Not modify the data models
5. Handle the battle end condition properly

Here's the fixed scene file:

# Excerpt ID: d22bd0ea-8d14-43b5-be32-643dfe57af85

                return True
                
        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Added check for knocked out active creature at start of turn
2. Only show "Swap" option if valid swap targets exist
3. Handle case where a player has no valid actions
4. Added assertions to catch logic errors
5. Improved error handling throughout
6. Maintained scene/model separation
7. Kept all game logic in scene

This should resolve the test failures while maintaining the architecture and capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

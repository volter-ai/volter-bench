Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that is required but not provided in the JSON data. Since this is a data model, we need to handle this at the data level rather than setting it programmatically.

The solution is to:
1. Make `active_creature` optional in the Player model by using `None` as the default value
2. Add `active_creature` to the player JSON data, setting it to the first creature in their list

This follows the architecture because:
- We keep models as pure data schemas
- We handle all data through the JSON files
- We maintain proper typing with Optional/Union types
- We don't add methods to the models

Here are the two files that need to change:

# Excerpt ID: e7fddd8f-8717-4954-af94-5d61da6f9d50
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

# Excerpt ID: 44112cdc-531f-4c2c-b092-d8f7fd9a0514
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

This solution:
1. Makes `active_creature` optional in the model with `Optional[Creature] = None`
2. Provides the initial active creature in the JSON data
3. Maintains data schema purity
4. Follows the engine's capabilities and architecture
5. Should resolve the validation errors in the tests

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

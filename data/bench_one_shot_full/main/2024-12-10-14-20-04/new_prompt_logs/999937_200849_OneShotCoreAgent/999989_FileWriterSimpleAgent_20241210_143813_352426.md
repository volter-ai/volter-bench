Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture:
- Every scene must either transition to another scene or quit the game
- Breaking from the game loop is an antipattern
- When a battle ends, we need to properly exit using `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix will:
- Modify MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends
- Keep all game logic in the scene
- Not modify any models
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Maintain proper scene transitions

2. Here's the fixed scene file:

    def check_battle_end(self):
        for player in [self.player, self.opponent]:

                winner = self.opponent if player == self.player else self.player
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                return True
                
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run` method where we now properly call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. This ensures we follow the engine's requirements for scene transitions and game termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that in MainGameScene, when the battle ends, we're just returning from the run() method instead of properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the error message and engine architecture, we need to either:
- Call _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends
- Or transition back to the main menu

Since this is a game, it makes more sense to return to the main menu after a battle ends, allowing the player to play again or quit from there. This maintains better flow control and follows the engine's scene transition patterns.

I'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to MainMenuScene when the battle ends instead of just returning.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where instead of just returning when the battle ends, we now transition back to the MainMenuScene. This follows the engine's architecture by properly managing scene transitions and should resolve the test failure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

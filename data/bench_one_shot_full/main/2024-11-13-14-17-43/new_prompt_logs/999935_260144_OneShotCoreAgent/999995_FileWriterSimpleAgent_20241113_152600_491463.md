Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but getting an empty list. This happens when all creatures are either fainted or already active. We need to handle this case properly.

The error occurs in get_player_action() when trying to swap creatures. We filter out both fainted creatures AND the active creature, which could leave us with no choices. Instead, we should:

1. Only show the "Swap" button if there are actually valid creatures to swap to
2. If there are no valid swap targets, only show "Attack" as an option

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Check for available creatures before showing the Swap button
2. Only show valid choices to the player/bot
3. This ensures we never try to show an empty list of choices

This maintains the architecture and engine capabilities while fixing the empty choices issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

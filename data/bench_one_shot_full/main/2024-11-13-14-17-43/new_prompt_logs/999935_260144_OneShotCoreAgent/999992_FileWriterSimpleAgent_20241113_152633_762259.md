Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that MainGameScene is breaking from its game loop when the battle ends, instead of properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
1. `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene, or 
2. `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game entirely

In this case, when a battle ends (win or lose), we should return to the main menu. I'll modify MainGameScene to properly transition back to MainMenuScene when the battle concludes.

```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper scene transition in the run() method when battle ends
2. Instead of just breaking the loop, we now transition back to MainMenuScene
3. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must end with a transition or quit

This maintains the architecture and engine capabilities while fixing the scene transition issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how the MainMenuScene test handles scene transitions and quits.

We need to:
- Patch the _quit_whole_game method like we do in the menu scene test
- Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and the patched quit exception
- Verify the game ended properly through one of these expected paths

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: cc251b9c-22e6-467a-acc4-e4ada6dd217c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class QuitFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_game(*args, **kwargs):
                raise QuitFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game', side_effect=exit_game) as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except QuitFromScene:
                    print(f"game ended via quit in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert False, "Scene did not end through an expected path"

                assert mock_quit.called, "Game should have ended with _quit_whole_game"
                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added QuitFromScene exception to catch when the game quits
2. Patched _quit_whole_game to raise our custom exception
3. Added assertion to verify the game ended through _quit_whole_game
4. Added else clause to catch unexpected endings
5. Added assertion to verify quit was called

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing that the battle scene ends correctly through the quit mechanism.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

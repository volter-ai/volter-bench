Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in the test. The test is getting caught in an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, and when it finally hits quit_whole_game(), the exception isn't caught properly.

The fix is to modify the test to properly handle scene transitions and graceful exits. We need to:
1. Mock the transitions in MainGameScene test just like we do in MainMenuScene test
2. Catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Consider both transition and quit as valid test outcomes

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7d2b5634-0fe3-454c-9ec6-07312c6f982c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added mocking of scene transitions like in MainMenuScene test
2. Added handling of AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
3. Added proper cleanup in finally block
4. Added proper assertion to verify scene exits correctly

This ensures the test can properly handle all the ways the scene might end without getting caught in an infinite loop between scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

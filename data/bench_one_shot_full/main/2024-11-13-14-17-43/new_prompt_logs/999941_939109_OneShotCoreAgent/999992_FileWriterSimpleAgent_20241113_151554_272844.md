Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine's architecture, when a scene calls `_quit_whole_game()`, it raises a `_QuitWholeGame` exception that should be caught and handled appropriately. Looking at the test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly handles both scene transitions and game quits.

The solution is to update test_main_game_scene.py to:
- Patch the `_quit_whole_game` method like test_main_menu_scene does
- Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and the _QuitWholeGame exception
- Verify the game ended properly by checking if _quit_whole_game was called

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d73fc5d0-814e-49bc-8a99-ba9a3408a846
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game ended gracefully via _quit_whole_game in run {i}")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited via _quit_whole_game
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Scene did not end by calling _quit_whole_game"
                    print("_quit_whole_game called")
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This fix:
1. Adds proper patching of _quit_whole_game
2. Catches both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Verifies the game ended properly by checking mock_quit.called
4. Follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py
5. Maintains all architectural requirements

The test will now properly handle the game ending through _quit_whole_game while still testing the random gameplay functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. When the battle ends and transitions to MainMenuScene, the random bot chooses to quit, which raises this exception. We need to:

- Catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Not change the core game logic

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 9cd067f7-0435-49f8-9785-0eb6c63a5a37
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully: {str(e)}")
                continue
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` to the caught exceptions
2. Added a print statement to show the graceful exit
3. Kept the ability to catch other expected exceptions like `RandomModeGracefulExit`
4. Re-raise any unexpected exceptions to ensure we don't mask real errors

This fix:
- Maintains the pure data model approach
- Works within engine capabilities
- Doesn't change any game logic
- Properly handles the expected quit game exception
- Keeps test coverage intact

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged as it was working correctly. This fix ensures proper test execution while staying within the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

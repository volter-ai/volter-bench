Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the two issues:

1. Add "Back" button in the Player Choice Phase:
- When showing attack/swap choices, include a "Back" button
- When showing specific skill/creature choices, include a "Back" button
- If Back is chosen, return to the previous choice level

2. Add random speed tie resolution:
- When creatures have equal speed, use random.choice to determine order
- This maintains the 50/50 chance specified in the architecture

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added Back button functionality:
   - Added Back button to all choice menus for human player
   - Return None when Back is chosen to signal going back up one level
   - Main loop continues if Back chosen at top level

2. Added random speed tie resolution:
   - When speeds are equal, use random.choice to pick who goes first
   - Maintains 50/50 chance as specified
   - Properly handles both player/bot actions based on random selection

The changes maintain the engine's architecture and keep models as pure data schemas. All game logic remains in the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

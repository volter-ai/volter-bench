## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed information and custom components. I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainGameScene component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   - We'll create a main container div that takes up the entire 16:9 game container.
   - Inside this, we'll have three main sections: HUD (top), Battlefield (middle), and User Interface (bottom).

2. HUD:
   - We'll implement this as a nav bar at the top of the screen using Tailwind classes for styling.

3. Battlefield:
   - We'll use a flex container to spread the player and opponent creatures horizontally.
   - We'll use the custom CreatureCard component to display each creature's information.

4. User Interface:
   - We'll create a text box area that can switch between displaying text and buttons.
   - For skills, we'll use the custom SkillButton component.

5. Styling:
   - We'll use Tailwind classes for inline styling to achieve the desired layout and appearance.
   - We'll use flex and grid layouts to organize the components.

6. Data Handling:
   - We'll create interfaces for the data structures we receive from the backend.
   - We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potentially missing data safely.

7. Button Interaction:
   - We'll use the useCurrentButtons hook to handle button interactions.

Now, let's implement the MainGameScene component:

# Excerpt ID: 9a73998f-d7db-4fff-bd7d-21b07a89b453
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <Shield className="mr-2" />
          <span>Player: {props.data.entities.player?.display_name}</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <span>Opponent: {props.data.entities.opponent?.display_name}</span>
          <Swords className="ml-2" />
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <span className="mb-2">Player</span>
          {playerCreature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={playerCreature.uid}
              name={playerCreature.display_name}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
              hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            />
          )}
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <span className="mb-2">Opponent</span>
          {opponentCreature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={opponentCreature.uid}
              name={opponentCreature.display_name}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
              hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {playerCreature?.collections?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the architecture described earlier and uses the custom components as specified. It creates a 16:9 game container with a HUD at the top, a battlefield in the middle, and a user interface at the bottom. The component uses Tailwind classes for styling and handles potential missing data with optional chaining.

The battlefield displays the player and opponent creatures using the CreatureCard component, and the user interface shows the player's skills using the SkillButton component. The component also integrates with the useCurrentButtons hook to handle button interactions.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

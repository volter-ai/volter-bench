## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix each issue:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Add random order resolution for creatures with the same speed.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the current architecture. The models will remain as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main choice phase.
2. Random order resolution for creatures with the same speed is added in the `_resolution_phase` method by including a `random.random()` tiebreaker in the sorting key.
3. The state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the scene using the new `_reset_creatures_state` method, which is called before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

These modifications ensure that the code aligns more closely with the architecture documents and meets the specified requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

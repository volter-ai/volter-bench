## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing regarding the damage calculation precision, we need to modify the `execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll ensure that the damage calculation uses floats before converting to an integer, as specified in the architecture document.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `execute_skill` method to use float calculations for the raw damage and final damage.
2. We'll only convert the final damage to an integer at the very end of the calculation.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 02fa509d-d6e4-4531-b13b-ad382b72ff91
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self.game_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self.battle_ended = False

    def game_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            self.check_battle_end()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def determine_turn_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature), (self.player, self.player_creature)
        else:
            first = random.choice([(self.player, self.player_creature), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)])
            second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature) if first[0] == self.player else (self.player, self.player_creature)
            return first, second

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order()
        first_skill = player_skill if first[0] == self.player else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first[0] == self.player else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(*first, first_skill, second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(*second, second_skill, first[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
```

The main changes in this updated implementation are:

1. In the `execute_skill` method, we now use `float()` to ensure that `raw_damage` is calculated as a float:
# Excerpt ID: e639e4a2-cea6-4ddd-bc87-fa9cf6933df7
   ```python
   raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
   ```

2. The `final_damage` is now calculated using float arithmetic and only converted to an integer at the end:
# Excerpt ID: d54028b1-1400-493a-984f-6af1e64f7ec5
   ```python
   final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
   ```

3. In the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, we've explicitly used float values (2.0 and 0.5) to ensure float arithmetic:
# Excerpt ID: 23b99b74-8d32-423e-b73c-d0ef89100e9a
   ```python
   effectiveness = {
       "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
       "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
       "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
   }
   ```

These changes ensure that the damage calculation uses floats before converting to an integer, as specified in the architecture document. This will provide more precise damage calculations, especially in cases where fractional damage values are important.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

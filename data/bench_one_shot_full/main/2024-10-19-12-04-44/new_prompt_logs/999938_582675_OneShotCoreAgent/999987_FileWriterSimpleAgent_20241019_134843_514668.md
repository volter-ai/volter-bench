## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Implement a random decision for action order when creatures have the same speed in the resolution phase.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `player_choice_phase` method, we'll add a 'Back' button that allows the player to return to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.
2. In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting of actions to include a random factor when creatures have the same speed.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods. If the player selects 'Back', the method returns `None`, which is then handled in the `player_choice_phase` method to allow the player to return to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.

2. In the `resolution_phase` method, the sorting of actions now includes a random factor when creatures have the same speed. This is achieved by using a tuple as the sorting key: `(x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random())`. If the speeds are the same, the random number will determine the order.

These changes maintain the separation of concerns between the models and the game logic, and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, while all the game logic is handled within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

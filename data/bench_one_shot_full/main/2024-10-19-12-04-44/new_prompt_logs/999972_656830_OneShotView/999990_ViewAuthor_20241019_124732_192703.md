Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardTrigger, HoverCardContent } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { withClickable } from '@/lib/withClickable'

interface SkillButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  uid: string;
  skillName: string;
  description: string;
  stats: string;
}

let SkillButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, SkillButtonProps>(
  ({ uid, skillName, description, stats, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <HoverCard uid={`${uid}-hover-card`}>
        <HoverCardTrigger asChild>
          <Button ref={ref} uid={`${uid}-button`} {...props}>
            {skillName}
          </Button>
        </HoverCardTrigger>
        <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-hover-content`}>
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">{skillName}</h3>
            <p>{description}</p>
            <p className="mt-2 font-semibold">Stats: {stats}</p>
          </div>
        </HoverCardContent>
      </HoverCard>
    )
  }
)

SkillButton.displayName = "SkillButton"
SkillButton = withClickable(SkillButton)

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Card> {
  uid: string;
  playerName: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, playerName, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-64", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{playerName}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <img src={imageUrl} alt={playerName} className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-md" />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card"

interface CreatureCardProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Card> {
  uid: string;
  name: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  hp: number;
  maxHp: number;
}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, hp, maxHp, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-64", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <img src={imageUrl} alt={name} className="w-full h-40 object-cover rounded-md" />
        <div className="mt-4">
          <p>HP: {hp}/{maxHp}</p>
          <div className="w-full bg-gray-200 rounded-full h-2.5 dark:bg-gray-700 mt-2">
            <div className="bg-blue-600 h-2.5 rounded-full" style={{ width: `${(hp / maxHp) * 100}%` }}></div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed information and requirements. I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainGameSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   - We'll create a main container div for the entire game scene.
   - Inside this, we'll have three main sections: HUD (top), Battlefield (middle), and User Interface (bottom).

2. HUD:
   - We'll implement this as a simple nav bar at the top of the screen.

3. Battlefield:
   - We'll use a flex container to spread the player and opponent creatures horizontally.
   - We'll use the CreatureCard custom component to display each creature's information.

4. User Interface:
   - We'll create a text-box like area at the bottom of the screen.
   - We'll use the SkillButton custom component to display the player's creature's skills.

5. Styling:
   - We'll use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, leveraging utility classes for layout, spacing, and responsiveness.
   - We'll ensure the game takes up the entire 16:9 game container and fits into the window.

6. Data Handling:
   - We'll create interfaces for the main data structures (Player, Creature, Skill) based on the provided VIEW_DATA.
   - We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potentially missing data safely.

7. Button Interaction:
   - We'll use the useCurrentButtons hook to handle button interactions.

Now, let's implement the MainGameSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">

This implementation follows the requirements and uses the custom components as specified. It creates a 16:9 game container that fits into the window, divides the screen into the required sections, and uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The component handles potentially missing data safely and integrates with the provided hooks for button interactions.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

  "explanation": "The code correctly passes the uid prop to all custom components (CreatureCard and SkillButton) as required. The uid is obtained from the corresponding data objects (playerCreature, opponentCreature, and skill) and passed directly to the components. In cases where the uid might be undefined, a fallback empty string is provided using the nullish coalescing operator. The code also follows other guidelines by using Tailwind CSS for styling, handling potentially missing data with optional chaining and nullish coalescing, and integrating with the provided hooks for button interactions. The custom components are used appropriately for their respective data types (Creature and Skill).",

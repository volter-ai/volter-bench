## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the issue of passing a uid prop to custom components, and ensure all other guidelines are followed. Here's the corrected code:

# Excerpt ID: b411a053-ea24-4c00-9de0-712aad0807fd
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  uid: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Creature Battle Game
      </div>

      <div className="text-2xl text-white">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
            uid={`${props.data.uid}-play-button`}
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </Button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
            uid={`${props.data.uid}-quit-button`}
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. I've imported the `Button` component from "@/components/ui/button", assuming it's a custom UI component that accepts a uid prop.

2. I've added a `uid` property to the `GameUIData` interface to ensure we have a unique identifier for the scene.

3. I've replaced the standard HTML `button` elements with the custom `Button` component.

4. Each `Button` component now receives a `uid` prop, constructed using the scene's uid and a descriptive suffix.

5. The code still uses inline Tailwind styles for layout and appearance.

6. Error handling for potentially missing data is still in place (e.g., for the player name).

7. The existing imports and named exports have been maintained.

8. The component still renders based on the availability of button slugs in `availableButtonSlugs`.

This version should now meet all the specified requirements, including passing a uid prop to custom UI components.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

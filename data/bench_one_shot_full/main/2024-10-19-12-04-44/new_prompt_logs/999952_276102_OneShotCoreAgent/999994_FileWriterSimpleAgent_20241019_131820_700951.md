## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not implementing random order resolution for skills when creatures have the same speed, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills in the randomly determined order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or architecture. It only involves modifying the logic in the `MainGameScene` class.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 5e1ab1ee-59e3-4aa1-b94f-b773ac4ba201
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            first, second = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation now correctly handles the case when creatures have the same speed by randomly determining the order of skill execution. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, and this solution adheres to the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container that will house our main menu content. We'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title Display:
   We'll create a large title area at the top of the screen using Tailwind classes for sizing and positioning.

4. Button Area:
   We'll create a button container at the bottom of the screen, which will hold the available action buttons.

5. Background:
   We'll apply a background color or gradient to the entire container using Tailwind classes.

6. Button Rendering:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs array to dynamically render buttons for available actions. We'll map over this array to create buttons for each available action.

7. Button Interaction:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks, which will trigger the appropriate action in the game logic.

8. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

9. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 12880bf4-63a9-40b9-942a-63049b554300
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { label: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { label: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Creature Adventure
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 h-12 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
              <span>{config.label}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>

      <div className="text-white text-sm">
        Welcome, {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Adventurer"}!
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, dynamically rendered buttons at the bottom, and a welcome message. The layout uses Tailwind classes to achieve the desired look and responsiveness. The component handles potential missing data gracefully and uses the provided useCurrentButtons hook to manage button rendering and interactions.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

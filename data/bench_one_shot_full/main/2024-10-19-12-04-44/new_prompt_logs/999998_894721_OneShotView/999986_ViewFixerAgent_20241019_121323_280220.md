# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  imageUrl: string; // Ensure this is part of the data
  collections?: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-blue-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid ?? ""}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
            imageUrl={playerCreature?.imageUrl ?? "/placeholder-creature.jpg"}
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
            className="mb-2"
          />
          <span className="text-sm font-bold">Player</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Swords className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-red-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature?.uid ?? ""}
            name={botCreature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
            imageUrl={botCreature?.imageUrl ?? "/placeholder-creature.jpg"}
            hp={botCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
            className="mb-2"
          />
          <span className="text-sm font-bold">Opponent</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
              const skill = playerCreature?.collections?.skills?.find(
                (s: Skill) => s.uid === slug
              );
              return skill ? (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              ) : null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-gray-700">
            Waiting for available actions...
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows that the UI is not displaying the available actions as expected. The text "Waiting for available actions..." is visible, indicating that no buttons are being rendered. This suggests that `availableButtonSlugs` might be empty or not being populated correctly. Additionally, the image URLs for the creatures are not loading, as indicated by the broken image icons.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Data Population**: Ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is being populated correctly. This might involve checking the logic in `useCurrentButtons` to ensure it is returning the correct data.

2. **Image URL Handling**: Verify that the `imageUrl` property for each creature is correctly set and accessible. If the URL is incorrect or the image is missing, provide a valid placeholder.

3. **Code Adjustments**:
   - Ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is correctly populated.
   - Verify the `imageUrl` paths or provide a valid placeholder.

### Code Implementation

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  imageUrl: string; // Ensure this is part of the data
  collections?: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-blue-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid ?? ""}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name ?? "Unknown"}
            imageUrl={playerCreature?.imageUrl ?? "/placeholder-creature.jpg"}
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp ?? 0}
            className="mb-2"
          />

          />
          <span className="text-sm font-bold">Opponent</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
              const skill = playerCreature?.collections?.skills?.find(
                (s: Skill) => s.uid === slug
              );
              return skill ? (
                <SkillButton
                  key={skill.uid}
                  uid={skill.uid}
                  skillName={skill.display_name}
                  description={skill.description}
                  stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              ) : null;
            })}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-gray-700">
            Waiting for available actions...
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Data Population**: Ensure `availableButtonSlugs` is correctly populated by checking the logic in `useCurrentButtons`.
- **Image Handling**: Verify the `imageUrl` paths or provide a valid placeholder to avoid broken images.
- **UI Rendering**: Ensure that the buttons are rendered when `availableButtonSlugs` is not empty.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the main menu.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 32979cd3-5ad1-48f3-8aef-77413a55a255
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        while True:
            if self._is_battle_over():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break
            self._player_turn()
            if self._is_battle_over():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break
            self._opponent_turn()

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s turn!")
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, choice.thing)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _is_battle_over(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop continues until the battle is over.
2. Adding a `_handle_battle_end` method that shows the battle result and transitions back to the main menu.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to properly exit the `MainGameScene` and return to the `MainMenuScene`.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected, with proper scene transitions and game termination.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

Currently, when the battle ends, we just break from the loop. Instead, we should:
- When a player wins, show the victory message and then quit the whole game
- This maintains the engine's scene transition requirements while keeping the game flow intact

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                return True
        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Added `_quit_whole_game()` calls when:
   - A player wins (after check_battle_end returns True)
   - Either player has no valid actions
2. Removed direct `break` statements that would exit the scene improperly
3. Added `return` statements after `_quit_whole_game()` to ensure clean exit

This maintains the engine's requirements that scenes must end through proper transition methods while keeping the game logic intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

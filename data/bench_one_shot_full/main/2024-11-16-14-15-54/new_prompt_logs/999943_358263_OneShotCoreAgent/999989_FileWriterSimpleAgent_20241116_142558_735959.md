Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because `_quit_whole_game()` raises an exception that needs to be caught. Looking at the test code, we're only catching `TransitionFromScene`, but we need to also catch `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`.

The fix is simple:
- In the test file, add `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` to the exceptions we catch
- This matches how the engine expects games to end - either through transition or through a graceful quit
- No changes needed to models or game logic, just test handling

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d9d3cae0-5ace-43de-af6c-ad04744199d2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except (TransitionFromScene, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
                    print(f"exiting scene so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp`
2. Modified the try-except block to catch `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Both `TransitionFromScene` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` are now handled as valid ways to exit the scene

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both ways a scene can end - through transition or through graceful quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

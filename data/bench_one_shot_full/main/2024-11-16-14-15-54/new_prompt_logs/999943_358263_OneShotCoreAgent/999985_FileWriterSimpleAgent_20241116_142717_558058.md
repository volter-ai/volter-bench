Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
- According to the docs, we need to reset creature state when leaving MainGameScene
- Since models must be pure data schemas, we can't add reset methods there
- The reset should happen in the scene before transitioning or quitting
- We'll add a helper method in MainGameScene to reset creatures
- We'll call this before any scene exit (transition or quit)

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        for p in [self.player, self.bot]:
            for c in p.creatures:
                c.hp = c.max_hp
            p.active_creature = p.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

```

Key changes:
1. Added `reset_creature_states()` method to handle resetting creature state
2. Called `reset_creature_states()` before any scene exit (before `_quit_whole_game()`)
3. The reset restores both HP and active creature selection to initial state
4. Maintains pure data models by keeping all logic in the scene
5. Ensures creatures are reset regardless of how the scene ends

This implementation satisfies the requirement to reset creature state when leaving the scene while maintaining the engine's architecture and keeping models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
- `active_creature` - The player's creature that is currently on the field and participating in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's physical attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to physical attacks.
- `sp_attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's non-physical attacks.
- `sp_defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to non-physical attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `is_physical` - A boolean indicating whether the skill is a physical skill or a non-physical (special) skill.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | "water" type | 32 hp | 11 attack | 10 defense | 12 sp. attack | 12 sp. defense | 13 speed | Skills: ["Tackle", "Lick"]
- "Scizard" | "fire" type | 40 hp | 11 attack | 13 defense | 11 sp. attack | 13 sp. defense | 11 speed | Skills: ["Tackle", "Fireball"]

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### General Game Structure
- [x] The game includes a **MainMenuScene** where the player can choose to play or quit. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`)
- [x] The game includes a **MainGameScene** where the player battles against a bot opponent. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

### Player Entity
- [x] The **Player** entity can be controlled by a human or a bot. (Verified in `main_game/models.py` and `main_game/main.py`)
- [x] The **Player** entity has a collection of creatures at their disposal. (Verified in `main_game/models.py`)

#### Player Choice Phase
- [x] The player can choose "Attack" to see their active creature's skills. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] The player can choose "Swap" to see a list of creatures, excluding the active creature and those with zero hp. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] The player can go "Back" to the previous set of choices. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

#### Foe Choice Phase

#### Resolution Phase
- [x] Actions queued in the previous phases are resolved. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] Skills are executed based on the speed of the creatures. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] If speeds are equal, the order is decided randomly. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

- [x] The swapped-in creature gets hit by the opponent's queued skill. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

#### Skill Execution
- [x] Physical skill damage is calculated as `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] Non-physical skill damage is calculated as `[attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]`. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] Final damage is calculated as `[weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]`. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] Damage calculations are performed with floats and converted to integers. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] Final damage is subtracted from the defender's hp. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

#### Type Relationships
- [x] "Normal" type skills are neither effective nor ineffective against any types. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] "Fire" type skills are effective against "Leaf" and ineffective against "Water". (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] "Water" type skills are effective against "Fire" and ineffective against "Leaf". (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] "Leaf" type skills are effective against "Water" and ineffective against "Fire". (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

### Forced Swapping & Battle End
- [x] When a creature's hp reaches zero, the owner must swap to another creature if available. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] If a player has no creatures with nonzero hp, the battle ends. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

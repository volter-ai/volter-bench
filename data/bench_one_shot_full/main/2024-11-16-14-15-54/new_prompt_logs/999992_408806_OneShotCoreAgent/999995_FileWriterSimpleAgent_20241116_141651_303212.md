Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that the test is failing because _quit_whole_game() raises an exception that isn't being caught in the test. In the test, we need to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception just like we catch RandomModeGracefulExit.

The test should expect either:
- RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves reach 0)
- AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame (when the battle ends naturally)

This matches the engine's design where _quit_whole_game() is meant to gracefully exit the game with an exception that should be caught.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 828a02e9-7d8b-4096-a5eb-df51711c1c76
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle ended naturally. Ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Adds another except clause to catch the game ending naturally
3. Maintains all architectural constraints while properly handling the engine's expected behavior
4. Keeps the test's purpose of ensuring the scene runs without crashing
5. Follows the engine's design where _quit_whole_game() is a valid way to end a scene

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error is occurring because of an f-string syntax error in main_game_scene.py. The issue is with the backslash in 'Foe\'s'. In Python f-strings, you can't use backslashes in the expression parts. 

The fix is simple - we need to modify how we format the possessive "Foe's" string. Instead of using a backslash escape in the f-string expression, we can either:
a) Use double quotes around the string containing single quotes
b) Store the possessive forms in variables before the f-string
c) Use string concatenation instead of a conditional expression

I'll use option b) as it's the cleanest solution and makes the code more readable.

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the problematic f-string with backslash escape
2. Added owner variable assignments before f-strings
3. Made the code more consistent by using the same pattern throughout
4. Kept all functionality exactly the same while fixing the syntax error

The rest of the architecture remains unchanged as this was purely a syntax issue in one file.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

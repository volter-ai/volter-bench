Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to use a Player object as a dictionary key in `turn_actions`. The error message suggests we should use prototype_id instead of the object itself. 

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to store turn actions using the player's prototype_id as the key instead of the Player object itself. We'll need to:
- Change turn_actions to use prototype_ids as keys
- Add methods to lookup players by their prototype_ids
- Modify all related methods to work with prototype_ids

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene implementation:

```

The key changes are:
1. Changed turn_actions to use prototype_id as key instead of Player object
2. Modified all references to turn_actions to use player.prototype_id
3. Kept all other functionality the same

This should resolve the unhashable type error while maintaining the game's functionality within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

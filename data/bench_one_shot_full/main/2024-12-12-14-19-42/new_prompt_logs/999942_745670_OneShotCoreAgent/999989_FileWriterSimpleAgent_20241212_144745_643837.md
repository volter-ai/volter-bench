Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning to another scene or calling quit_whole_game. When the battle ends (win or lose), we need to either:
- Return to the main menu, or
- Quit the game entirely

Given this is a simple game, it makes sense to quit the game after a battle ends. We need to modify MainGameScene to call self._quit_whole_game() when check_battle_end() returns true.

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        player_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)
        opponent_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.opponent.creatures)
        
        if not player_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

        elif not opponent_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now call self._quit_whole_game() when check_battle_end() returns True. This ensures the scene properly exits through the engine's mechanisms rather than just breaking the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture docs. According to the docs:

"The player choice phase is a branching series of choices... The player also is shown the choice to go 'Back', which sends the player back to the previous set of choices."

To fix this, I'll:
- Modify the _get_player_action method to include a "Back" button in both the skill selection and creature swap menus
- Use a loop to allow returning to the main action menu when "Back" is selected
- Keep using the engine's Button and SelectThing choices
- Maintain the same battle logic structure
- Not modify any models since they're pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Modified _get_player_action to include a "Back" button in submenus
2. Added a while loop in _get_player_action to handle returning to main menu
3. Added back buttons to both attack and swap choice menus
4. Maintained all existing battle logic and structure
5. No changes to models or other components needed

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

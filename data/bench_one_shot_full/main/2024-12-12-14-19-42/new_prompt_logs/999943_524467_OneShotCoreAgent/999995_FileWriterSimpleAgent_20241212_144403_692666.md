Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that the test is failing because it can't find `main_game.scenes.main_game_scene`. This is happening because we referenced MainGameScene in main.py before implementing it. We need to implement the MainGameScene class that handles the battle logic.

The scene needs to:
- Handle battle phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
- Calculate damage based on type effectiveness and stats
- Handle creature swapping
- Track battle state and victory conditions

2. Here's the implementation of MainGameScene:

This implementation:
1. Follows the scene structure from the docs
2. Uses the engine's choice system for player input
3. Implements all battle mechanics including:
   - Type effectiveness
   - Physical vs Special attacks
   - Speed-based turn order
   - Creature swapping
   - Victory conditions
4. Uses proper model references and engine capabilities
5. Maintains game state appropriately
6. Provides feedback via _show_text
7. Returns to menu after battle completion

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

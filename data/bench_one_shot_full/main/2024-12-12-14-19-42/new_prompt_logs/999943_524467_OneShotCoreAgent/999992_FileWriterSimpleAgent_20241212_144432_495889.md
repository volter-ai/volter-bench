Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene._execute_turn when player_action is None. This happens because in the run() method, we don't handle the case where no valid choices are available for the player's swap action.

The fix needs to:
- Ensure player_action is never None by providing a default attack action if no swap is possible
- Follow the engine's pattern of using _wait_for_choice for all decisions
- Maintain the scene's battle logic structure
- Keep the models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added _get_player_action method to encapsulate action selection logic
2. Ensured player_action is never None by defaulting to attack if swap isn't possible
3. Fixed type hints to properly reflect Skill | Creature possibilities
4. Maintained proper use of _wait_for_choice throughout
5. Kept all game logic within the scene
6. No changes to models required as they remain pure data schemas

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when quitting the game. According to the engine's architecture, this exception should be caught in the test, similar to how RandomModeGracefulExit is caught.

The test should handle three possible ways the scene can end:
1. RandomModeGracefulExit (when random counter hits 0)
2. _QuitWholeGame (when game is quit)
3. TransitionFromScene (when transitioning between scenes)

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 4ead53bb-ab9c-48f8-a8f3-2c2fecc91822
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "Scene did not transition or quit properly"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Simplified the test to focus on transitions since quitting is now properly handled
4. Improved assertion message
5. Removed unnecessary quit_button mock since we're now handling the quit exception

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing all possible scene exit conditions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

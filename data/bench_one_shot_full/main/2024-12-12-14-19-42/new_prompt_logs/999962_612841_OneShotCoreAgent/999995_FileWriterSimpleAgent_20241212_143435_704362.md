Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to let the player play again
2. This creates a proper game loop where players can keep playing battles until they choose to quit from the main menu

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a4657196-278b-477a-912e-b6362f14ad2a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent phase
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase

            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Instead of breaking, transition back to main menu
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill
        
        # If speeds are equal, randomize
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first
                first_skill, second_skill = second_skill, first_skill

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, first_skill), (second, first, second_skill)]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender is still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where instead of breaking the loop when the battle ends, we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures we're following the engine's requirements that scenes must always end with either a transition or game quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test needs to catch this exception since it's an expected part of the game flow when quitting.

Looking at the stack trace, we can see the game is working as intended:
1. Battle happens
2. Returns to menu
3. Eventually hits quit
4. Raises _QuitWholeGame

We need to modify the test to catch this exception, similar to how we catch RandomModeGracefulExit. This is the correct behavior according to the engine's design.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: febf9785-5729-4d3d-acb5-49e2c9be91c4
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print("game quit gracefully")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all handler that fails the test for unexpected exceptions
4. Added print statements to help with debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game flow where quitting is a normal part of the game cycle. The test will now pass while still verifying the game's behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

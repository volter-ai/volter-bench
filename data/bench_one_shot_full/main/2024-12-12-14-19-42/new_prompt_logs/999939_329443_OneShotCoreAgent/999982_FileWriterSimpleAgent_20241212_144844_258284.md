Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture docs. According to the docs:

> The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

To fix this, I'll:
1. Add a "Back" button to the skill selection and creature swap menus
2. Implement a loop that allows returning to the main menu when "Back" is selected
3. Keep all game logic in the scene
4. Not modify any models
5. Stay within engine capabilities using Button choices

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added new `get_player_action()` method to handle the player choice phase with Back functionality
2. Added Back button to both skill selection and creature swap menus
3. Implemented a loop in `get_player_action()` that returns to main menu when Back is selected
4. Maintained all architectural requirements and engine capabilities
5. No changes to models needed

The solution properly implements the Back functionality while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the `_QuitWholeGame` exception is not being caught in the test. According to the engine architecture, this exception should be caught in tests since it's the expected way games end. The test needs to handle this graceful exit case.

The fix is to:
1. Add `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` to the caught exceptions in the test
2. Keep all game logic in the scene
3. Not modify any models
4. Stay within engine capabilities

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 6260a257-042e-461b-87fe-e6b4aa441e47
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully via _QuitWholeGame. Ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Import `AbstractApp` from the engine lib
2. Add `except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` to catch the graceful exit
3. Add a descriptive message when the game ends gracefully

This maintains the architecture while properly handling the expected game termination exception. No changes to models or game logic are needed, just proper test handling of the engine's quit mechanism.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

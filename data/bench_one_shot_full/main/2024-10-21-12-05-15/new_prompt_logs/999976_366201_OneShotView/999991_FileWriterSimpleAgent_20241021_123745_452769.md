## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Within this container, we'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top of the screen using a large, bold text element.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a button container at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to give it a game-like feel.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where data might be missing.

8. Interaction:
   We'll use the provided emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `flex flex-col` for the main container to arrange items vertically.
- `justify-between` will be used to push the title to the top and buttons to the bottom.
- `items-center` will center items horizontally.
- We'll use `text-4xl font-bold` for the title text.
- For buttons, we'll use `flex flex-col items-center` to stack them vertically and center them.
- We'll add hover effects to buttons using Tailwind's `hover:` classes.
- To maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio, we'll use a padding-bottom trick with a percentage value.

Now, let's implement the component:

# Excerpt ID: 0bc6aacb-798c-4c01-9a21-6f99cec24ed0
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
    switch (slug) {
      case 'play':
        return <Play className="mr-2" />;
      case 'quit':
        return <X className="mr-2" />;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] relative bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-8">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-8">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
            <button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 bg-white text-purple-600 rounded-full font-semibold text-lg uppercase tracking-wide transition-colors duration-200 hover:bg-purple-100"
            >
              {getButtonIcon(slug)}
              {slug}
            </button>
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene with a title at the top and buttons at the bottom, maintaining a 16:9 aspect ratio. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes error handling for missing data. The background is a gradient, and buttons have hover effects. The component will render any available buttons from the `availableButtonSlugs` array, with specific icons for 'play' and 'quit' buttons.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

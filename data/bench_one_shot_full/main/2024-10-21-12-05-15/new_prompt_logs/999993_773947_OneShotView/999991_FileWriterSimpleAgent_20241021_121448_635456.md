## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. The main container will be a flex column with items aligned center and justified between.

3. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top of the screen using large, bold text.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a button container at the bottom of the screen. Buttons will be dynamically rendered based on the availableButtonSlugs provided by the useCurrentButtons hook.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the entire view using Tailwind classes.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where data might be missing.

8. Icons:
   We'll use Lucide React icons for the buttons to enhance the visual appeal.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 9ac95cf3-dd93-4f51-8084-2408d5043827
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: 'Play', icon: Play },
    quit: { text: 'Quit', icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mt-16">Game Title</h1>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;
          
          const Icon = config.icon;
          return (
            <button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="bg-white text-blue-600 font-semibold py-3 px-6 rounded-full shadow-lg hover:bg-blue-100 transition duration-300 flex items-center space-x-2"
            >
              <Icon size={24} />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </button>
          );
        })}
      </div>

      <div className="absolute bottom-4 left-4 text-sm opacity-70">
        {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || 'Unknown Player'}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and dynamically rendered buttons at the bottom. The buttons are styled with Tailwind classes to create an attractive and interactive appearance. The player's name is displayed in the bottom-left corner for context.

The component uses null checks and optional chaining to handle potential missing data. It also uses the availableButtonSlugs to determine which buttons to display, mapping them to predefined configurations with icons and text.

The layout is responsive and should maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio within the game container. You may need to add additional container styling in the parent component to ensure the proper sizing and aspect ratio.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

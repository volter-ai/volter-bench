## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll describe how to fix these issues and then provide the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions.

1. How to fix the issues:

a) Missing 'Back' option in the player choice phase:
   - Add a 'Back' button to the attack and swap choices.
   - Implement logic to return to the main choice when 'Back' is selected.

b) Missing random selection for ties in speed during the resolution phase:
   - Modify the sorting of actions to include a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.

c) Missing reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the scene:
   - Add a method to reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp.
   - Call this method when the battle ends, before quitting the game.

These changes will be implemented while adhering to the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

2. Rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choices, allowing players to return to the main choice.
2. Random selection for ties in speed during the resolution phase has been implemented by adding a random tiebreaker to the sorting key.
3. A `reset_creatures` method has been added to reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp, and it's called before quitting the game when the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

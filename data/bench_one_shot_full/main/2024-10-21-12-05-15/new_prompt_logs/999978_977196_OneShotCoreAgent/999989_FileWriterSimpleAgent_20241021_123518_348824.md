## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `game_loop` method in `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and who won.
3. We'll add a method to display the final battle result before transitioning.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected pattern of always transitioning or quitting the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e274dc3b-2a5b-4d24-9ee6-31bb7aaafce3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.opponent_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended, player_won = self.check_battle_end()
            if battle_ended:
                self.show_battle_result(player_won)
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if self.check_battle_end()[0]:
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self):
        player_tuple = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        opponent_tuple = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return player_tuple, opponent_tuple
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return opponent_tuple, player_tuple
        else:
            return random.choice([(player_tuple, opponent_tuple), (opponent_tuple, player_tuple)])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True, False
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True, True
        return False, False

    def show_battle_result(self, player_won):
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} won the battle!")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Modifying the `game_loop` method to check for battle end after each resolution phase and transition to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. Updating the `check_battle_end` method to return a tuple (battle_ended, player_won) to provide more information about the battle result.
3. Adding a `show_battle_result` method to display the final outcome of the battle before transitioning.

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, addressing the FixableException raised in the test. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `transition_to_scene` or `quit_whole_game`.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture. It maintains the separation of concerns between the models and the game logic, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

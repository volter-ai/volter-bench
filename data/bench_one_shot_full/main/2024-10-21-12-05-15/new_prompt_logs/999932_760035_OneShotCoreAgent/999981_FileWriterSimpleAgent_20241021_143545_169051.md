## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the random decision for action order when creatures have the same speed. This functionality should be added to the `MainGameScene` class, specifically in the `_resolution_phase` method.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random tiebreaker when creatures have the same speed.
2. We'll use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random float between 0 and 1 for each action, which will be used as a tiebreaker in case of equal speeds.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models. We don't need to modify the `models.py` file as this change only affects the scene logic.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

This solution addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing phase by implementing a random decision for action order when creatures have the same speed. Specifically:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include a `random.random()` value as a tiebreaker.
2. This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, their order will be randomly determined, as specified in the original requirements.

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly handles the case where creatures have the same speed, addressing the issue raised in the QA/testing phase. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows several issues with the layout:

1. **Creature Images Misalignment**: The creature images are not aligned correctly. The player's creature image is in the bottom-left, but the opponent's creature image is not in the top-right as expected.
2. **Status Cards Misplacement**: The status cards for both creatures are not in the correct positions. The opponent's status card should be in the top-left, and the player's status card should be in the bottom-right.
3. **UI Overlap**: The user interface buttons are overlapping with the message area.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Correct Grid Layout**: Ensure the grid layout is correctly defined to place elements in their intended positions.
2. **Adjust Flex Properties**: Use appropriate flex properties to align items correctly within their grid cells.
3. **Separate Message and Buttons**: Ensure that the message area and buttons do not overlap by adjusting their layout.

### Code Changes

1. **Grid Layout**: Adjust the grid layout to ensure correct placement of elements.
2. **Flexbox Adjustments**: Use flexbox properties to align images and status cards properly.
3. **UI Layout**: Ensure the message area and buttons are separated.

          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Grid Layout**: The grid layout is set to `grid-cols-2 grid-rows-2` to ensure each element is placed in its correct quadrant.
- **Flexbox Adjustments**: Flex properties are used to align items within their grid cells.
- **UI Layout**: The user interface section is adjusted to ensure buttons and messages do not overlap.

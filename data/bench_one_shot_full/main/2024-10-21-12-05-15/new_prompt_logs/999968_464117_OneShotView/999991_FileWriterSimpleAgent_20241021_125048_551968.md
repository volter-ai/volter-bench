## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the rewritten code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. The main container will be a flex column with items aligned center and justified between.

3. Title Display:
   We'll create a large title at the top of the screen using Tailwind classes for text size, weight, and positioning.

4. Button Layout:
   We'll create a flex container for buttons at the bottom of the screen, arranging them vertically.

5. Button Rendering:
   We'll map through the availableButtonSlugs array to render buttons dynamically. Each button will use the emitButtonClick function when clicked.

6. Background:
   We'll add a background color to the main container to represent the game's background.

7. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

9. Lucide Icons:
   We'll import and use Lucide icons for the buttons to enhance the UI.

Now, let's rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with this implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 78bb7cc9-19f0-4d06-a6a2-97f974cbd9b4
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || 'Player';

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Creature Battle Game
      </div>
      
      <div className="text-2xl text-white mb-8">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, a welcome message, and buttons for playing and quitting the game at the bottom. The layout is responsive and centered, using Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The buttons are only rendered if they are available in the current game state, and they use Lucide icons for visual enhancement.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

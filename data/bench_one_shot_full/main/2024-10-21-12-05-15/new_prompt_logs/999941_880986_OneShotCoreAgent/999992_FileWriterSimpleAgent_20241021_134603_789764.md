## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `get_swap_action` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `get_swap_action` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before creating the choices.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None instead of calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list.
3. In the `get_player_action` method, we'll handle the case where `get_swap_action` returns None by defaulting to the attack action.

Here's the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by checking if there are any available creatures to swap to before creating the swap choices. If there are no available creatures, it returns None, which is then handled in the `get_player_action` method by defaulting to the attack action. This should prevent the `_wait_for_choice` method from being called with an empty list of choices, resolving the AssertionError.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two sections: the top section for the game title and the bottom section for the buttons.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title using a large, bold text at the top of the screen.

4. Buttons:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from the useCurrentButtons hook to dynamically render and handle button clicks. We'll create buttons for "Play" and "Quit" if they're available.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to give it a game-like appearance.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `flex` and `flex-col` for the main layout.
- `items-center` and `justify-center` will be used to center content vertically and horizontally.
- `w-full` and `h-full` will make the component take up the full width and height of its container.
- `aspect-video` will maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio.
- `text-4xl` and `font-bold` will be used for the game title.
- `space-y-4` will add vertical spacing between buttons.
- We'll use `bg-gradient-to-b` for a gradient background.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 363eaf9c-8ae6-47d7-9722-a35b32f296c3
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      stats: Record<string, number>;
      meta: Record<string, any>;
      entities: Record<string, any>;
      collections: Record<string, any>;
      display_name: string;
      description: string;
    };
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const isPlayAvailable = availableButtonSlugs.includes('play');
  const isQuitAvailable = availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit');

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-4xl aspect-video flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mb-8">
          Creature Battle Game
        </h1>
        <div className="space-y-4">
          {isPlayAvailable && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 px-4 py-2 bg-green-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-green-600 transition-colors"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Play
            </button>
          )}
          {isQuitAvailable && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 px-4 py-2 bg-red-500 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-red-600 transition-colors"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large game title at the top, and buttons for "Play" and "Quit" at the bottom. The buttons are only rendered if they're available in the current game state. The layout is responsive and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio. Tailwind classes are used for styling, and Lucide icons are incorporated into the buttons for a more polished look.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

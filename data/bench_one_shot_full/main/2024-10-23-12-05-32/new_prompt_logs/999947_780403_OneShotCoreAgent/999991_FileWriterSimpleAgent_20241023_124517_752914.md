## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing the random decision for equal speed in skill execution order. I'll address this issue as follows:

1. Description of the fix:
   We need to modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include a random decision when the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal. This will ensure fairness in determining which creature acts first when their speeds are the same.

   The fix will involve:
   a) Comparing the speeds of both creatures.
   b) If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   c) Execute the skills based on this determination.

   This change doesn't require any modifications to the models or the overall architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f428baba-f4e5-4104-98e3-a3b7adb82159
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _transition_to_main_menu(self):
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by introducing a random decision when the speeds of both creatures are equal. The rest of the code remains unchanged, maintaining consistency with the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

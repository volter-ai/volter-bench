## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random choice for equal speed:
   In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll add a condition to randomly choose the order when speeds are equal.

2. Reset creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene:
   We'll add a new method `_reset_creatures` to reset the HP of all creatures to their max HP. This method will be called before transitioning to another scene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The random choice for equal speed is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method.
2. The `_reset_creatures` method is added and called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their max HP.

These modifications align the implementation with the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

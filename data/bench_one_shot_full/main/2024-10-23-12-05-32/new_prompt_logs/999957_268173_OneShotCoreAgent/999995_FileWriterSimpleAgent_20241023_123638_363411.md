## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The main problem is that the `MainGameScene` is not properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle ends. This causes the scene to terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is an antipattern in our game engine.

To fix this, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_check_battle_end` method, instead of just returning True when the battle ends, we'll transition to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll remove the `_reset_creatures` method since we're transitioning to a new scene, and creature reset should be handled when creating new creatures.
3. We'll update the `run` method to continue the game loop until we transition to another scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 82c4235f-533c-4716-a091-c1d3b759bc28
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Battle start!")
        
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, addressing the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This should resolve the test failures and adhere to the expected patterns of the game engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The current implementation doesn't handle speed ties randomly as specified in the requirements. To fix this, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to introduce a random factor when the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random decision when speeds are tied.
2. We'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly select which creature goes first in case of a speed tie.
3. We'll keep the rest of the logic intact, ensuring we're still within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

This implementation now correctly handles speed ties by randomly deciding which creature goes first when their speeds are equal. The rest of the game logic remains intact, and we're still working within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and we've maintained the separation of concerns by keeping all game logic within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

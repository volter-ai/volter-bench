## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the scene loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 23fd4aaa-20fa-406b-87aa-a3e9dc3fe317
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - foe_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the following issues:

1. The scene now properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the game loop continues.
2. We've added a check to ensure the HP doesn't go below 0 in the resolve_turn method.
3. The reset_creatures method is called before transitioning to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that creatures' HP is reset for the next battle.
4. The run method now returns after transitioning to the MainMenuScene, preventing any further execution in this scene.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The test cases should now pass without the previous errors.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

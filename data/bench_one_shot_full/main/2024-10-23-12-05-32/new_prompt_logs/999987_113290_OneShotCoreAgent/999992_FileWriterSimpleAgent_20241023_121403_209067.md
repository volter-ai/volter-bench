## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The main problem is that the `MainGameScene` is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends. To fix this, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to either transition back to the `MainMenuScene` or quit the game after the battle concludes.

Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. In the `run` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll add logic to transition or quit after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and who won.
3. After the battle ends, we'll show the result and then either transition back to the main menu or quit the game.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e64428c5-06ae-43a1-a470-93fe71c32f10
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_end, player_won = self._check_battle_end()
            if battle_end:
                if player_won:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

                choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])
                
                if choice == play_again_button:
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                else:
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, opponent):

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
        
        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[1], first[2])
        if self._check_battle_end()[0]:
            return
        
        self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[1], second[2])

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True, False  # Battle ended, player lost
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True, True  # Battle ended, player won
        return False, False  # Battle not ended
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly ending the scene and either transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game after the battle concludes. The `run` method now includes logic to handle the end of the battle, and the `_check_battle_end` method has been updated to return both whether the battle has ended and who won.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to return True when the battle is over, and use this to break out of the game loop.
3. We'll add a call to _transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game at the end of the game loop.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: def09aab-b068-4397-9392-353461138fe7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self._get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The game now properly exits the MainGameScene by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. The _check_battle_end method now returns True when the battle is over, which breaks the game loop.
3. After the game loop ends, we call _transition_to_scene to go back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the FixableException in the test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots test and the AssertionError in the test_main_game_scene_random_run test. The scene will now exit in an expected manner, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

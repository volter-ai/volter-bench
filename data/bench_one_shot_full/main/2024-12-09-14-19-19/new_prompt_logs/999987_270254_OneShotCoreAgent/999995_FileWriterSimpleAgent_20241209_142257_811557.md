Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is a NameError because 'uuid' is not defined in main.py. This is a simple import issue - we need to import the uuid module at the top of main.py. Looking at the original main.py, while uuid was used in the code, its import statement was missing.

2. Solution:
I'll rewrite main.py with the proper import. The rest of the code is correct and follows the architecture guidelines - this was just a missing import statement.

# Excerpt ID: de5acc61-18e0-4aa4-b17e-e054dd2c9469
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

This fix:
1. Maintains all architectural requirements
2. Doesn't modify any models
3. Keeps the same functionality
4. Just adds the missing import
5. Should resolve the test failures

The error was purely about the missing import and not related to any architectural or model issues. All the model definitions and scene logic remain unchanged.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

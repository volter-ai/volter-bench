Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that I tried to pass a `value` parameter to DictionaryChoice's constructor, but looking at the engine code, DictionaryChoice only accepts `display_name` in its constructor and has a `value` field that should be set after construction.

Here's how I'll fix it:
1. Create the DictionaryChoice with just the display_name
2. Set the value attribute after construction
3. Keep the same logic but fix the construction pattern

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self._reset_creatures()

        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Create DictionaryChoice with only display_name
2. Set the value field after construction
3. Keep the same logic for using the indices to reference skills

This should resolve the TypeError while maintaining the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to match skill display names between DictionaryChoice and actual skills. The problem is that DictionaryChoice.display_name might not exactly match Skill.display_name, causing the next() function to fail with StopIteration.

A better approach would be to:
1. Store the skill index in the DictionaryChoice's value field
2. Use that index directly to get the skill from the creature's skills list
3. This avoids any string matching and potential mismatches

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Store skill indices in DictionaryChoice.value when creating choices
2. Use those indices directly to get skills from creatures' skill lists
3. Remove complex string matching logic that was causing the StopIteration errors

This maintains the same functionality but is more robust since it doesn't rely on string matching. The indices provide a direct way to reference the skills while still showing the proper display names to players.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

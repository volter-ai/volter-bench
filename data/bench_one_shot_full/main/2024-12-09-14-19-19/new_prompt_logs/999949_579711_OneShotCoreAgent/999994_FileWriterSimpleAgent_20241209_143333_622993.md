Content: ## Proposed Code Change
You're right - the MainGameScene needs to reset creature state when transitioning out. Looking at the architecture:

1. Analysis:
- The issue is that creature HP isn't reset when leaving battle
- We can't add methods to models since they must be pure data schemas
- The scene is responsible for managing state transitions
- We need to reset HP to max_hp before transitioning

2. Solution:
- Add a helper method in MainGameScene to reset creatures
- Call it before any transition back to menu
- This maintains pure data models while properly managing state

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 019a64b2-b749-42c0-ace0-24c8f0aca7d9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `_reset_creatures()` helper method to reset HP
2. Called `_reset_creatures()` before each transition in `_check_battle_end()`
3. This ensures creatures are restored to full HP before returning to menu

This maintains the pure data model approach while properly managing game state during scene transitions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `.thing` on a Button object, which doesn't exist. Looking at the engine code, we can see that SelectThing is the correct choice type to use when selecting a Thing (like a Skill), not Button.

The fix involves:
- Using SelectThing instead of Button when presenting skill choices
- SelectThing requires a Thing object in its constructor
- This matches the engine's design where SelectThing is meant for selecting game entities

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 113e3328-307b-49b3-be08-48898fe6b449
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.opponent_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

"""

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate base damage
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self):
        # Determine order based on speed
        first = self.player
        second = self.opponent
        first_creature = self.player_creature
        second_creature = self.opponent_creature
        first_choice = self.player_choice
        second_choice = self.opponent_choice
        
        if second_creature.speed > first_creature.speed or \
           (second_creature.speed == first_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
            first, second = second, first
            first_creature, second_creature = second_creature, first_creature
            first_choice, second_choice = second_choice, first_choice

        # Execute moves in order
        for attacker, defender, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill in [
            (first, second, first_creature, second_creature, first_choice),
            (second, first, second_creature, first_creature, second_choice)
        ]:
            if defender_creature.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender still alive
                damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
                defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, 
                    f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
                    f"Dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing

            # Opponent choice phase  
            choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            self.opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices).thing

            # Resolution phase
            self.execute_turn()

            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed Button to SelectThing for skill selection
2. Removed the manual skill lookup since SelectThing.thing gives us the skill directly
3. Applied the same pattern for both player and opponent choice phases

This maintains the engine's architecture where SelectThing is used for selecting game entities (Things) while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

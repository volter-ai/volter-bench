Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to access display_name on a None skill when handling attacks. This happens because we're not properly handling the case where _handle_attack returns (None, 0) when the player chooses "Back".

The fix should:
1. Only show attack messages when there's actually a skill used (not None)
2. Handle the "Back" case properly by returning to the main choice menu
3. Keep the models as pure data schemas
4. Stay within the engine's capabilities

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

Key changes:
1. Added null checks in _execute_turn before accessing skill.display_name
2. Added a while loop in run() to keep asking for player action until a valid one is chosen
3. Added validation to ensure we break the loop only when we have a valid action
4. Kept all models and architecture intact
5. Only modified the scene logic to handle the edge cases better

This should fix the NoneType errors while maintaining the game's functionality and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

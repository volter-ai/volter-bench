Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene doesn't properly end by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. When the battle ends (win or lose), it just returns from the run() method, which is an antipattern according to the engine.

Solution:
- After showing the battle result message, we should call `self._quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game
- This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit
- The fix needs to be made in the MainGameScene's check_battle_end() method

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key change is in the check_battle_end() method where we now properly call self._quit_whole_game() when the battle ends, either in victory or defeat. This ensures the scene terminates correctly according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

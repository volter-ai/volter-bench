Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're hitting a case where there are no available choices for the player. This happens when we try to show swap choices but there are no valid creatures to swap to (all creatures are either fainted or active).

The fix should:
1. Always check if there are valid choices before presenting them
2. Handle the case where a player has no valid choices by skipping that option
3. Ensure there's always at least one valid choice presented to the player

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Created a new `get_player_action` method that safely handles choice presentation
2. Only show the "Swap" option if there are actually creatures available to swap to
3. Simplified the bot logic to avoid potential empty choice lists
4. Added better validation before presenting choices

This should fix the empty choices issue while maintaining the game's functionality and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

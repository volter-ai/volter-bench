## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing random order implementation when creatures have the same speed during the resolution phase, I'll modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how I'll fix it:

1. In the resolution_phase method, I'll add a check to see if the creatures have the same speed.
2. If they do have the same speed, I'll use Python's random.choice to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. I'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issue by implementing a random order when creatures have the same speed during the resolution phase. The `resolution_phase` method now checks if the speeds are equal and uses `random.sample` to determine the order of attacks in that case. This ensures that when creatures have the same speed, the order of attacks is randomly determined, as specified in the architecture documentation.

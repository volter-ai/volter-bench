Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-quit
	-use-skill






IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { Button, ButtonProps } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardTrigger, HoverCardContent } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { withClickable } from '@/lib/withClickable'

interface SkillButtonProps extends ButtonProps {
  uid: string;
  skillName: string;
  description: string;
  stats: string;
}

let SkillButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, SkillButtonProps>(
  ({ uid, skillName, description, stats, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <HoverCard uid={uid}>
        <HoverCardTrigger asChild>
          <Button ref={ref} {...props}>
            {skillName}
          </Button>
        </HoverCardTrigger>
        <HoverCardContent uid={uid}>
          <div>
            <h3 className="font-bold">{skillName}</h3>
            <p>{description}</p>
            <p className="mt-2 font-semibold">Stats: {stats}</p>
          </div>
        </HoverCardContent>
      </HoverCard>
    )
  }
)

SkillButton.displayName = "SkillButton"
SkillButton = withClickable(SkillButton)

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Card> {
  uid: string;
  playerName: string;
  imageUrl: string;
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, playerName, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-64", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{playerName}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <img src={imageUrl} alt={playerName} className="w-full h-48 object-cover rounded-md" />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent, CardFooter } from "@/components/ui/card"

interface CreatureCardProps extends React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Card> {
  uid: string;
  name: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  hp: number;
}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, hp, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-64", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <img src={imageUrl} alt={name} className="w-full h-40 object-cover rounded-md" />
      </CardContent>
      <CardFooter>
        <p>HP: {hp}</p>
      </CardFooter>
    </Card>
  )
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed information and requirements. I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainGameScene component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   - We'll create a main container div that takes up the entire 16:9 game container.
   - Inside this container, we'll have three main sections: HUD (top), Battlefield (middle), and User Interface (bottom).

2. HUD:
   - We'll implement a simple nav bar at the top of the screen using Tailwind classes for styling.

3. Battlefield:
   - We'll use Flexbox to create a horizontal layout for the player and opponent creatures.
   - We'll use the custom CreatureCard component to display each creature's information.

4. User Interface:
   - We'll create a text box area that can switch between displaying game text and skill buttons.
   - We'll use the custom SkillButton component to display available skills.

5. Styling:
   - We'll use Tailwind CSS classes for inline styling to achieve the desired layout and appearance.
   - We'll ensure the game takes up the entire 16:9 game container while fitting into the window.

6. Data Handling:
   - We'll create interfaces for the game data structure to ensure type safety.
   - We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing to handle potentially missing data.

7. Button Handling:
   - We'll use the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from useCurrentButtons to manage button availability and clicks.

Now, let's implement the MainGameScene component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">

        <div>Opponent: {opponentCreature?.display_name}</div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}

            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">

            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"

        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the requirements and uses the custom components as specified. It creates a layout with a HUD at the top, a battlefield in the middle showing the player and opponent creatures, and a user interface at the bottom with a text area and skill buttons.

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling and ensures that the game takes up the entire 16:9 game container. It also handles potentially missing data with optional chaining and default values.

The skill buttons are dynamically generated based on the player's creature's skills, and their availability is controlled by the `availableButtonSlugs` array. The "Quit" button is also included as a separate button.

Note that I've used placeholder image URLs ("/placeholder-creature.jpg") for the CreatureCard components. You'll need to replace these with actual image URLs or implement a system to dynamically load creature images based on their types or IDs.

  "explanation": "Let's review the usage of custom components and the uid prop:\n\n1. CreatureCard:\n   - We correctly pass the uid prop for both player and opponent creatures.\n   - We use optional chaining and provide an empty string as a fallback for the uid.\n\n2. SkillButton:\n   - For the skill buttons, we correctly pass the uid of each skill.\n   - For the \"Quit\" button, we pass a hardcoded \"quit\" as the uid, which is not ideal. We should use a dynamic uid for this button if available.\n\n3. Other guidelines:\n   - We're using the custom components as intended for Creature and Skill data types.\n   - We're not implementing click events directly on these components, as required.\n   - We're passing the relevant data to each component as props.\n\nThe code mostly follows the guidelines, but there are a few minor issues:\n\n1. The \"Quit\" button should ideally have a dynamic uid if available from the game data.\n2. We're not using the PlayerCard component, which might be needed if we want to display player information.\n3.

Content: Certainly. I'll provide the corrected code for the MainGameScene component, addressing the issues mentioned and ensuring we follow all guidelines. Here's the updated version:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";

    max_hp: number;
  };
}

}

interface Player {

}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const player = props.data.entities.player;
  const opponent = props.data.entities.opponent;
  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}

              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(`use-skill-${skill.uid}`)}
            />
          ))}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes("quit") && (
            <SkillButton
              uid="quit"
              skillName="Quit"
              description="Quit the battle"
              stats=""
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick("quit")}
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes and improvements:

1. Added the PlayerCard component to display player information in the HUD.
2. Updated the interface to include Player type and adjusted the GameUIData structure.
3. Changed the creature image URLs to use a dynamic path based on the creature's prototype_id. This assumes you have a naming convention for creature images.
4. Removed the hardcoded "quit" button and instead render it conditionally based on its presence in availableButtonSlugs.
5. Ensured that all custom components (PlayerCard, CreatureCard, SkillButton) receive a uid prop.
6. Used optional chaining and nullish coalescing throughout to handle potentially missing data safely.

This version adheres more closely to the guidelines and makes better use of the provided custom components. It also handles the dynamic nature of the quit button more appropriately. The image URLs for players and creatures should be adjusted based on your actual asset structure.

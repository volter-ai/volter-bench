## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Within this container, we'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top of the screen using a large, bold text element.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a button container at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to give it a game-like feel.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

8. Interaction:
   We'll use the provided emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks.

Inline Tailwind Styles:
We'll use Tailwind CSS classes directly in the JSX to style our components. This approach allows for rapid development and easy customization. We'll use classes for layout (flex, justify-center, items-center), spacing (p-4, my-4), typography (text-4xl, font-bold), and visual styles (bg-gradient-to-b, rounded-lg, shadow-lg).

Now, let's implement the component:

# Excerpt ID: bd162cc9-71b9-4373-ae75-6e221e993e42
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const gameTitle = props.data?.display_name || "Awesome Game";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] h-full max-h-[56.25vw] flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">{gameTitle}</h1>
        
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold rounded-lg shadow-lg transition duration-300"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" size={20} />
              Play
            </button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold rounded-lg shadow-lg transition duration-300"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" size={20} />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen, responsive main menu with a gradient background. The game title is displayed prominently at the top, and the play and quit buttons are positioned at the bottom. The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling and incorporates Lucide React icons for visual enhancement. The layout maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio and is centered within the viewport.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement explicit queue management for skill execution:
   - Create a queue to store the selected skills for both the player and the bot.
   - Execute the skills in the order they were added to the queue during the resolution phase.

2. Reset the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - Add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning to another scene.

Here's the updated `MainGameScene` implementation:

# Excerpt ID: cfda0f83-fcb3-4ef5-a275-92a79277ce1a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            self.skill_queue.append((self.player, player_skill))
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._bot_turn()
            self.skill_queue.append((self.bot, bot_skill))
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Opponent's turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.bot_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            if attacker == self.player:
                self.bot_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {skill.damage} damage.")
            else:
                self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {skill.damage} damage.")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. It uses a `deque` (double-ended queue) to manage the skill execution order. Skills are added to the queue during the player and bot turns, and then executed in order during the resolution phase.

2. It adds a `_reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value before transitioning out of the scene. This method is called in the `_check_battle_end` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns more closely with the architecture documents while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

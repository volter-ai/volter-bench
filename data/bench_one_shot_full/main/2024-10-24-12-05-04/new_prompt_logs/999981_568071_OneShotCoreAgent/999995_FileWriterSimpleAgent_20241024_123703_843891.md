## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method of MainGameScene, instead of just returning True, we'll transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll add a new method `end_battle` to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition or quit.
3. We'll modify the game_loop to break when the battle ends, ensuring we don't continue the loop unnecessarily.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = max(0, attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.end_battle(f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.end_battle(f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self, message):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)
        play_again = Button("Play Again")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, quit_game])
        
        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The `check_battle_end` method now calls `end_battle` when the battle is over, instead of just returning True.
2. The new `end_battle` method shows the battle result and gives the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. The `game_loop` breaks when `check_battle_end` returns True, ensuring that the scene exits properly.

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene always exits by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which should resolve the test failures and the FixableException we were seeing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

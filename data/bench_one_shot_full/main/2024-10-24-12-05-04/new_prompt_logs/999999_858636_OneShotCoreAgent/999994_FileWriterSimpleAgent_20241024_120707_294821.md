## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this functionality within the scene itself.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e104b7bf-f03c-4fc3-bda4-dbec6880d315
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if quit_button == choice:
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._quit_whole_game()

            if use_skill_button == choice:
                skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
                skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
                self.apply_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            # Opponent turn
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_creature.skills[0]  # Simple AI: always use the first skill
            self.apply_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def apply_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding a `reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

The changes maintain the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. We didn't add any methods or properties to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The reset functionality is implemented within the scene, which is where game logic should reside according to the guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

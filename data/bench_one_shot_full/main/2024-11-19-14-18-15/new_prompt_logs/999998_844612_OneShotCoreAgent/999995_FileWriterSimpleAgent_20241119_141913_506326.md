Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling reset(), we'll directly set hp = max_hp in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: a26e8d3c-22ee-496e-abfd-4406904f4a1f
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

# Excerpt ID: f0e29273-4afa-495e-ad38-c98ac1dc938e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            skill_buttons = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_buttons)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self.bot_creature.skills[0]  # Bot always uses first skill
            self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, [Button(bot_skill.display_name)])

            # Resolution phase
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving (moved from model to scene)
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Replaced creature.reset() calls with direct hp assignment in MainGameScene
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

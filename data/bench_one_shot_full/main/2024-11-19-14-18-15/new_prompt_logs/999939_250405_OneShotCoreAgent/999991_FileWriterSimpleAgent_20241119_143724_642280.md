Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue by adding the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture documentation. According to the docs, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should be able to go back to the main choice menu.

The fix will be in MainGameScene.py, specifically in the `get_player_action` method. We'll:
1. Add a "Back" button to both the skills and swap creature menus
2. Handle the back button by recursively calling `get_player_action`
3. Keep the same model structure since this is just UI flow logic

Here's the complete fixed file:

```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method:
1. Added a "Back" button to both the skills menu and swap menu
2. When "Back" is chosen, we recursively call `get_player_action` to return to the main choice menu
3. The rest of the logic remains unchanged, we just handle the new navigation flow

This implementation now fully matches the architecture documentation's requirement for a "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase, while maintaining all the existing functionality and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're not properly handling the case when a player has no valid creatures to swap to. This happens in `get_player_action` when the "Swap" option is chosen but there are no available creatures (all are either knocked out or active).

The fix should:
1. Check if there are available creatures before offering the "Swap" choice
2. Only show "Attack" if there are no valid swap targets
3. Ensure we never call `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. In `get_player_action`, we now check for available creatures before offering the "Swap" choice
2. The choices list always includes "Attack" but only includes "Swap" if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. This ensures we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player

The rest of the battle logic remains the same, we just properly handle the case where a player has no valid swap targets. This should fix the test failures while maintaining the game's design and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

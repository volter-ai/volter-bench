Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models, which violates the pure data schema requirement. The models should only contain data fields, with all logic implemented in scenes.

To fix this:
1. Remove the `reset()` methods from models
2. Move the reset logic to the scenes where it's needed
3. Keep only the data fields in models.py

Here's the corrected models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 967a5d95-4e20-4253-84a0-06cce6076aed
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The reset functionality should be handled in the scenes where needed. For example, when transitioning to/from the MainGameScene, we'll need to:
1. Reset creature HP to max_hp
2. Reset active_creature to None

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while still providing the same functionality. Would you like me to show the scene implementation with this reset logic?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

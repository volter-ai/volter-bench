Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that main.py is trying to import MainGameScene which hasn't been created yet, but we're registering it in App. We should either:

1. Create MainGameScene first, or
2. Remove the MainGameScene registration until we implement it

The safer approach is option 2 - remove the MainGameScene registration for now and add it later when we implement the scene. This follows an incremental development approach and lets us test MainMenuScene independently.

Here's the fixed main.py:

# Excerpt ID: ed0ddd3f-b676-4ce8-8130-2fd2e7332c44
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        # We'll add MainGameScene registration when we implement it
        # self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This change will allow the tests to run since they won't try to import a non-existent module. We can then implement MainGameScene separately and add its registration back to App when it's ready.

The MainMenuScene will need a temporary modification to not transition to MainGameScene yet, but we can add that transition once MainGameScene is implemented.

Would you like me to show the temporary MainMenuScene implementation as well?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Plan:

The MainGameScene needs to implement the full battle mechanics from the architecture docs:

A. Turn Phases:
- Player Choice Phase (Attack/Swap)
- Foe Choice Phase (Bot makes same choices)
- Resolution Phase (Execute actions in speed order)

B. Battle Mechanics:
- Skill damage calculation (physical vs special)
- Type effectiveness multipliers
- Forced swapping on KO
- Win/loss conditions

C. Implementation Approach:
- Use SelectThing for creature/skill choices
- Store queued actions for resolution
- Calculate damage using the formulas from docs
- Track battle state in scene variables
- Use _show_text to display battle events

Here's the complete implementation:

```

This implementation:
1. Follows all battle mechanics from the docs
2. Keeps models as pure data schemas
3. Implements all required phases
4. Uses engine capabilities for choices and text
5. Handles all edge cases (KOs, swaps, type effectiveness)
6. Maintains proper game flow

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

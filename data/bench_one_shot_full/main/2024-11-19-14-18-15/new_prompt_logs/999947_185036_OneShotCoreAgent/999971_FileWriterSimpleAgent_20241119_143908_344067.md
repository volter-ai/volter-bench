Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that we're missing the forced swap logic when a creature is knocked out. According to the docs, when a creature's HP reaches zero, we need to:
- Prompt the owner to swap to another creature (if they have any with nonzero HP)
- Present this as a list of choices of available creatures
- Only end the battle if no creatures are available

We'll fix this by:
1. Adding a check after each attack to see if a creature was knocked out
2. If so, prompt the owner to swap before continuing
3. Only proceed with the battle if the swap was successful
4. End the battle if no creatures are available for swap

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `force_swap_knocked_out` method to handle forced swapping
2. Modified `resolve_turn` to check for knockouts after each attack
3. Added proper battle end conditions when no creatures are available
4. Improved swap handling to prevent swapping when no creatures are available
5. Removed redundant battle end check since it's now handled in resolve_turn
6. Added appropriate messages for knockouts and swaps

This implementation now properly handles the forced swap mechanic while maintaining the engine's architecture requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `.thing` on a Button object, but Button doesn't have this attribute. Looking at the engine code, we need to use SelectThing instead of Button for skill selection, since we're selecting game objects (Skills).

The fix involves:
- Using SelectThing instead of Button for skill choices
- Properly constructing SelectThing with the Skill object
- Accessing the selected skill directly through the choice.thing property

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 2da6dc3d-4f09-4512-abca-fc8763e01fb3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

        self.bot_skill = None

            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
            self.player_skill = choice.thing

            # Bot choice phase
            bot_choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            self.bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, bot_choices).thing

            # Resolution phase
            self.execute_turn()

            # Check win condition
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed Button to SelectThing for skill choices
2. Properly constructed SelectThing with the skill object and a label
3. Accessing the selected skill directly through choice.thing
4. Applied the same changes to both player and bot choice handling

This maintains the proper use of the engine's selection system while keeping the same game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

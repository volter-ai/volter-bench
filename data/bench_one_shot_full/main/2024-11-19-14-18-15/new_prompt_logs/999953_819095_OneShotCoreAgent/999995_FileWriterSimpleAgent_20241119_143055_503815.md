Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling reset(), we'll directly set the hp back to max_hp in the scene

This maintains separation between data (models) and logic (scenes).

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Changed the creature reset logic in MainGameScene from `self.player_creature.reset()` to `self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp`

This maintains proper separation between data and logic while keeping the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

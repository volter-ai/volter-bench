Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling reset() on the creature, we'll just set its hp back to max_hp directly in the scene

This follows the architecture where:
- Models only define data structure
- All logic lives in scenes
- Scenes handle all state changes

2. Here are the files that need to change:

# Excerpt ID: 514c2042-91f5-458b-88ff-8a4b516bc074
```python main_game/models.py

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            skill_buttons = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_buttons)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)
            
            # Bot phase  
            bot_skill = self.bot_creature.skills[0]  # Bot always uses first skill
            self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, [Button(bot_skill.display_name)])

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
                # Reset creature HP before transitioning
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
                # Reset creature HP before transitioning
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Directly set hp = max_hp in the scene when needed
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove all methods from models.py
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp value directly in the scene when needed

2. Here's the rewritten models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 92b30d82-96ee-40a5-bf6e-4e9b4b96dd9c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  # fire, water, etc
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str  # fire, water, etc
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And the MainGameScene needs to be modified to handle the reset logic directly. Here's the relevant changes to make to main_game_scene.py (only showing the modified parts):

# Excerpt ID: bd895fd2-6da7-46fc-b777-2d7207fd42a6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures by setting hp to max_hp
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures    
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
```

The rest of main_game_scene.py remains the same. This change moves the logic out of the models and into the scene where it belongs, while keeping the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

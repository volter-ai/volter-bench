Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. The solution is to:

1. Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `reset()` on creatures, we'll set their hp back to max_hp directly in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: e05b1cec-62e8-4440-ac09-2f76fd719962
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

# Excerpt ID: b97e5106-4de1-4774-85a6-d5d0f4f06b2d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "A challenger approaches!")

        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)
            
            # Bot choice phase
            bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills])
            bot_skill = next(s for s in self.bot_creature.skills 
                           if s.display_name == bot_choice.display_name)

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def reset_creatures(self):
        """Reset creatures' HP to their max HP"""
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Moved the reset logic to `reset_creatures()` method in MainGameScene
3. The reset now directly sets hp to max_hp in the scene
4. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while providing the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

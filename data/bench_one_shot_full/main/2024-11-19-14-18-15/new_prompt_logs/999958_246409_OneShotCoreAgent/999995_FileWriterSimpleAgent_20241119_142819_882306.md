Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` in the scene

Here's the corrected models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: deb153f9-ed4d-491b-8ca4-07734356a45d
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

And here's the relevant part of MainGameScene that needs to be modified (though you only asked for the file that needs fixing):

The line:
# Excerpt ID: 05bf776e-c6c9-4ff6-a727-e115d76f70d9
```python
self.player_creature.reset()
self.bot_creature.reset()
```

Should be changed to:
# Excerpt ID: 2ea651b4-53ec-4f65-943e-688b7000ecce
```python
self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This keeps all logic in the scenes and models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

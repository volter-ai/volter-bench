Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: dd4e6361-d84b-47f8-bb73-3d4c0dbb2f94
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

And for completeness, here's the modified section in MainGameScene where the reset happens:

# Excerpt ID: 2192bdc9-6f05-48c2-a0db-bac8f8a2f3be
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle begins between {self.player.display_name} and {self.bot.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self.player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot choice phase
            self.bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn()
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
                break
            elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is removing the method from the model and putting the logic directly in the scene. This maintains the separation between data (models) and behavior (scenes).

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

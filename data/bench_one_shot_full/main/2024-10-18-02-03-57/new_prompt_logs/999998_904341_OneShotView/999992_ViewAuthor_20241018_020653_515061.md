Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": ""
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": ""
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two main sections: the top section for the game title and the bottom section for the buttons.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title prominently at the top of the screen using large, bold text.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create buttons for "Play" and "Quit" options, positioned at the bottom of the screen. We'll use the availableButtonSlugs to determine which buttons to display and the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks.

5. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to ensure the layout is responsive and maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio within the game container.

6. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

7. Styling:
   We'll use inline Tailwind classes to style the components according to the described view. This includes centering content, setting appropriate font sizes, and adding padding and margins.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
    emitButtonClick(slug);
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] aspect-video bg-gray-800 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center">
            Creature Battle Game
          </h1>
        </div>
        <div className="flex space-x-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
              className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Play
            </button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
              className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the described architecture and meets the requirements:

1. It uses a single functional component `MainMenuSceneView`.
2. The layout is full-screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio, achieved using Tailwind CSS classes.
3. The game title is displayed prominently at the top.
4. Buttons for "Play" and "Quit" are positioned at the bottom, using the `availableButtonSlugs` to determine which buttons to show.
5. The design is responsive and maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio.
6. Error handling is implemented through the use of the `includes` method when checking for available button slugs.
7. Styling is done entirely with inline Tailwind classes.
8. The component uses the `Play` and `X` icons from `lucide-react` for the buttons.

This implementation should provide a clean, responsive main menu for the game, following the described layout and functionality.

The code follows the other guidelines by using the provided useCurrentButtons hook, maintaining the existing imports, and using inline Tailwind styles for the layout and design. The component is responsive, handles potential missing data (through the use of availableButtonSlugs.includes checks), and uses icons from lucide-react as requested.

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The skills are not being displayed correctly. The image shows only two buttons: "Tackle" and "Quit", while the code suggests there should be multiple skill buttons based on the player creature's skills.

2. The creature images are not being displayed, instead showing placeholder text "Bubwool".

3. The layout of the battlefield doesn't exactly match the description in the design document, which specifies that creatures should be spread out horizontally.

4. The game description text is not properly displayed, showing only "Battle in progress..." instead of more detailed information.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Ensure that the `playerCreature.collections.skills` is properly defined and populated. If it's undefined, provide a fallback.
2. Update the `CreatureCard` component to properly display the creature image.
3. Adjust the layout of the battlefield to spread the creatures horizontally.
4. Implement a proper game description display mechanism.

Here's the implemented solution:

# Excerpt ID: eea4127f-c02c-4de7-a549-e23f1d65549c
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections?: {
    skills?: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
  description: string;
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Sword className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${playerCreature.uid}.jpg`}
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature.uid}
            name={opponentCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${opponentCreature.uid}.jpg`}
            hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponentCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 shadow-lg">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 overflow-y-auto bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">
          <p>{props.data.description || "Battle in progress..."}</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {playerCreature.collections?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(`use-skill-${skill.uid}`)}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(`use-skill-${skill.uid}`)}
            />
          ))}
          <SkillButton
            uid="quit"
            skillName="Quit"
            description="Exit the battle"
            stats=""
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick("quit")}
            disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes("quit")}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Added a `collections` property to the `Creature` interface with an optional `skills` array.
2. Updated the `CreatureCard` component calls to use dynamic image URLs based on the creature's UID.
3. Added `maxHp` prop to `CreatureCard` components.
4. Updated the game description to use `props.data.description` with a fallback.
5. Added a null check for `playerCreature.collections?.skills` when mapping over skills.

These changes should resolve the issues observed in the image and align the component more closely with the design document. The skills should now be properly displayed if they exist in the player creature's data, and the creature images should be correctly loaded. The layout remains similar but now uses dynamic image URLs for the creatures.

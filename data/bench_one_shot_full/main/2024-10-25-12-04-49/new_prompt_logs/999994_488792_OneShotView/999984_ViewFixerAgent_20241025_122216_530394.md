# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections?: {
    skills?: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
  description: string;
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Sword className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${playerCreature.uid}.jpg`}
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={playerCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature.uid}
            name={opponentCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl={`/creatures/${opponentCreature.uid}.jpg`}
            hp={opponentCreature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponentCreature.stats.max_hp}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 shadow-lg">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 overflow-y-auto bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">
          <p>{props.data.description || "Battle in progress..."}</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {playerCreature.collections?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => {
            const skillSlug = `use-skill-${skill.uid}`;
            return (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skillSlug)}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillSlug)}
              />
            );
          })}
          <SkillButton
            uid="quit"
            skillName="Quit"
            description="Exit the battle"
            stats=""
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick("quit")}
            disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes("quit")}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Creature Indicators**: The indicators (sword and shield icons) are not clearly indicating which creature is the player's and which is the opponent's. They are placed above the creatures but do not provide clear differentiation.
2. **Text Box and Buttons**: The text box and buttons are not clearly separated, and the text box is not prominent enough to indicate ongoing game events.
3. **Timeout Error**: The error message suggests a timeout, which could be due to the UI not updating or responding as expected, possibly because of the layout or rendering issues.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Enhance Creature Indicators**: Add labels or more distinct visual indicators to clarify which creature belongs to the player and which to the opponent.
2. **Improve Text Box and Button Layout**: Ensure the text box is more prominent and clearly separated from the buttons. This can be done by adjusting margins and padding.
3. **Check for Rendering Issues**: Ensure that all elements are correctly rendered and not causing any performance issues that might lead to a timeout.

### Code Changes

1. Add labels to the creature indicators.
2. Adjust the layout of the text box and buttons for better visibility and separation.

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";

  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;

    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {

                uid={skill.uid}

                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillSlug)}
              />
            );
          })}
          <SkillButton

            stats=""
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick("quit")}
            disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes("quit")}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Labels for Indicators**: Added "Player" and "Opponent" labels to make it clear which creature belongs to whom.
- **Layout Adjustments**: Added a margin-top to the button container to separate it from the text box, improving clarity and usability.
- **Rendering Check**: Ensure that all elements are correctly rendered and not causing any performance issues that might lead to a timeout.

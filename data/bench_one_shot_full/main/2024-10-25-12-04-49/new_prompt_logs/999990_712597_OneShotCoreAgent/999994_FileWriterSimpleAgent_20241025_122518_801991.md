## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We can't add methods to the models, so we'll need to handle this in the MainGameScene.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value before transitioning out of the scene.
3. We'll call this method when the battle ends, regardless of whether the player won or lost.

Here's how we'll implement this solution in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 676bfa4f-1b29-4507-bf92-f019f15dab89
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn, {self.player.display_name}!")
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe turn
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"It's your turn, {self.foe.display_name}!")
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(current_player, skill_choices).thing

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.foe_creature, player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def _apply_damage(self, creature, damage):
        creature.hp = max(0, creature.hp - damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")

```

In this updated version of the MainGameScene, we've added a new `_reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the foe to their maximum HP. This method is called in two places:

1. At the end of the battle when `_check_battle_end` returns True.
2. When the player chooses to quit the game during their turn.

This ensures that the state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, addressing the issue raised in the QA pass. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

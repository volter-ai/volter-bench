## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The skill buttons are not visible in the UI, despite being present in the code.
2. The creature images are not loading properly, showing only alt text.
3. The layout of the battlefield doesn't match the description in the design document.

Here's a proposed solution to resolve these issues:

1. We need to ensure that the skill buttons are rendered when `availableButtonSlugs` has items. We'll modify the condition to check for `availableButtonSlugs.length > 0`.
2. We'll update the `imageUrl` prop for the `CreatureCard` components to use a placeholder image or remove it if not available.
3. We'll adjust the layout of the battlefield to spread the creatures horizontally as described in the design document.

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: da636799-eb4e-4cc4-b521-476940849775
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    base_damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
    attack: number;
    defense: number;
    speed: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    opponent: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Creature Battle</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={player_creature.uid}
            name={player_creature.display_name}
            hp={player_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Shield className="w-5 h-5 mr-1" />
            <span>Player's Creature</span>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponent_creature.uid}
            name={opponent_creature.display_name}
            hp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponent_creature.stats.max_hp}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Swords className="w-5 h-5 mr-1" />
            <span>Opponent's Creature</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white border-t-2 border-gray-300 p-4 h-1/3">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {player_creature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg h-full overflow-y-auto">
            <p className="text-lg">Game text will appear here...</p>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Removed the `imageUrl` prop from `CreatureCard` components as it's not available in the data structure and was causing issues with image loading.
2. Adjusted the condition for rendering skill buttons to `availableButtonSlugs.length > 0` to ensure they appear when available.
3. Kept the horizontal layout for the battlefield, which already matches the design document's description.

These changes should resolve the issues with the UI, making the skill buttons visible when available and fixing the creature display. The timeout error might be related to how the game state is being managed or updated, which is beyond the scope of this component. If the error persists, it may be necessary to investigate the `useCurrentButtons` hook or the overall game state management.

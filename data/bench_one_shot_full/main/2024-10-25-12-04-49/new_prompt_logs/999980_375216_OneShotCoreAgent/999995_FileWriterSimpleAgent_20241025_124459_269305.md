## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is not properly exiting when the battle ends. We need to ensure that the scene transitions to another scene or quits the game when the battle is over.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll add a choice for the player to either play again or quit the game.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition to a new `MainGameScene` or quit the whole game.
3. We'll move the battle logic into a separate method to make the code more organized.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b5357e95-c6dc-4f19-beb6-2d144edd6407
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while True:
            battle_result = self.run_battle()
            if battle_result:
                self.handle_end_of_battle(battle_result)
                break

    def run_battle(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            result = self.check_battle_end()
            if result:
                return result

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} and deals {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            return "lose"
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return "win"
        return None

    def handle_end_of_battle(self, result):
        if result == "win":
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You lose!")

        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This revised version of the `MainGameScene` addresses the issue by ensuring that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to a new game or quitting the whole game. The main changes are:

1. The `run` method now contains a loop that calls `run_battle` and `handle_end_of_battle`.
2. The `run_battle` method contains the main battle logic and returns the result when the battle ends.
3. The `handle_end_of_battle` method displays the result and gives the player a choice to play again or quit.
4. Based on the player's choice, the scene either transitions to a new `MainGameScene` or quits the whole game.

These changes should resolve the issue of the scene not exiting properly and failing the tests. The scene will now always end with either a transition to a new game or by quitting the whole game.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide a corrected version of the code that adheres to all the guidelines. Here's the updated implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 458791e7-56d6-4287-8ca9-6e2cbc860d46
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] relative bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <div className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center">
            Creature Battle Game
          </h1>
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4">
          {Object.entries(buttonConfig).map(([slug, { text, icon: Icon }]) => (
            availableButtonSlugs.includes(slug) && (
              <Button
                key={slug}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                className="bg-white text-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-100"
              >
                <Icon className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
                {text}
              </Button>
            )
          ))}
        </div>

        <div className="mt-4 text-white text-center">
          <p>Welcome, {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player"}!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues:

1. We're now using the pre-imported shadcn `Button` component.
2. We've implemented a 16:9 aspect ratio container using the padding-bottom trick (56.25% is the aspect ratio of 9/16).
3. We've kept the existing import for lucide-react icons.
4. We didn't need to pass a uid prop to any custom components in this case, as we're not using any that require it.

The layout maintains the same structure with the title at the top, buttons at the bottom, and a welcome message. The buttons are still dynamically rendered based on availability, and we've included error handling for potentially missing player data.

This implementation should now comply with all the given guidelines and requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The layout of the creatures and players doesn't match the design document. The player's creature should be in the bottom-left, but it's currently in the top-left.

2. The skill buttons are not correctly implemented. They should be displaying the creature's skills, but instead, we see "Tackle" and "Lick" buttons.

3. The "swap" button is present, but it's not implemented correctly according to the code.

4. The "Back" button is missing from the UI, even though it's in the code.

To resolve these issues, we need to make the following changes:

1. Adjust the grid layout to correctly position the player and opponent creatures and their status cards.
2. Implement the skill buttons correctly, using the creature's skills from the data.
3. Implement the "swap" button correctly using the available button slugs.
4. Add the "Back" button if it's available in the button slugs.

Here's the implemented solution:

        </div>

            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('attack') && playerCreature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Base Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('attack', { skillId: skill.uid })}
              />
            ))}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('back') && (
              <SkillButton
                uid="back-button"
                skillName="Back"
                description="Go back to the previous screen"
                stats="N/A"
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('back')}
              >
                <ArrowLeft className="mr-2" /> Back
              </SkillButton>
            )}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('swap') && (
              <SkillButton
                uid="swap-button"
                skillName="Swap"
                description="Swap your active creature"
                stats="N/A"
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('swap')}
              >
                <Repeat className="mr-2" /> Swap
              </SkillButton>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. The grid layout in the battlefield display area has been corrected to match the design document.
2. The skill buttons are now correctly implemented to use the creature's skills from the data.
3. The "swap" button is now correctly implemented using the available button slugs.
4. The "Back" button is added and will appear if it's available in the button slugs.

These changes should resolve the issues and make the component match the design document and function correctly.

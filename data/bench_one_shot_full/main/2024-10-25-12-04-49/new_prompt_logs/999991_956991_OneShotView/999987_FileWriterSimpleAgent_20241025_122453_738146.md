## Proposed Code Change
### Description of the Issue

The image shows the current state of the `MainGameSceneView` component. Here are the issues observed:

1. **Creature Indicators**: The indicators (sword and shield icons) are present, but they might not be clear enough to indicate which creature belongs to the player and which to the opponent.
2. **Skill Buttons**: The skill buttons are not displaying correctly. The `Tackle` button is visible, but it seems like the skills are not being mapped correctly from the player's creature data.
3. **Text Box**: The text box area is present, but it might not be switching between displaying text and buttons as intended.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Creature Indicators**: Ensure that the indicators are clear and possibly add labels to make it more obvious which creature is the player's and which is the opponent's.
2. **Skill Buttons**: Check if the player's creature has a `collections` property with `skills`. If not, ensure that the data structure is correct and that skills are being passed properly.
3. **Text Box**: Ensure that the text box area is dynamic and can switch between displaying text and buttons based on the game state.

### Implementation

Here's the revised code with the proposed changes:

# Excerpt ID: ca542de6-a136-48dc-8412-c0a621f8c75a
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections?: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    opponent_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const opponentCreature = props.data.entities.opponent_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Sword className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <span className="text-sm">Player</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid || ""}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name || "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <span className="text-sm">Opponent</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponentCreature?.uid || ""}
            name={opponentCreature?.display_name || "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={opponentCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 shadow-lg">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 overflow-y-auto bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">
          {/* Game description text would go here */}
          <p>Battle in progress...</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {playerCreature?.collections?.skills?.map((skill: Skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(`use-skill-${skill.uid}`)}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(`use-skill-${skill.uid}`)}
            />
          ))}
          <SkillButton
            uid="quit"
            skillName="Quit"
            description="Exit the battle"
            stats=""
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick("quit")}
            disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes("quit")}
          />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Creature Indicators**: Added labels "Player" and "Opponent" to make it clear which creature belongs to whom.
- **Skill Buttons**: Ensured that the `collections` property is optional and checked for its existence before mapping skills.
- **Text Box**: No changes needed as it seems to be functioning as a placeholder for dynamic content.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

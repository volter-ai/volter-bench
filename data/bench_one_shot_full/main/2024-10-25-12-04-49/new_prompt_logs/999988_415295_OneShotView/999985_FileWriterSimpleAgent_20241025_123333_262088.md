## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Layout and Alignment**: The battlefield area is correctly divided with the player and opponent creatures on the left and right, respectively. However, the user interface area seems to be taking up more space than necessary, which might be causing the timeout error due to inefficient rendering or layout calculations.

2. **UI Elements Visibility**: All expected elements are visible, but the text box area and buttons might not be optimally sized or positioned, potentially causing performance issues.

3. **Timeout Error**: The error message indicates a timeout, which could be due to inefficient rendering or layout calculations, possibly caused by excessive or unnecessary re-renders.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Optimize Layout**: Ensure that the layout is efficient and does not cause excessive re-renders. Use `flex` properties to ensure that elements are properly aligned and sized.

2. **Check Rendering Logic**: Ensure that the rendering logic is efficient and does not cause unnecessary re-renders. This can be done by checking the dependencies of hooks and ensuring that components are not re-rendering unnecessarily.

3. **Adjust CSS**: Make sure that the CSS properties are not causing any layout issues that could lead to performance problems.

### Implementation

Here's the revised code with optimizations:

# Excerpt ID: 4fe0c5b1-cbb8-4923-9ba3-f77e824beb2c
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const foeCreature = props.data.entities.foe_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Sword className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <span>Player</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature?.uid || ""}
            name={playerCreature?.display_name || "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
          />
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2" />
          <span>Opponent</span>
          <CreatureCard
            uid={foeCreature?.uid || ""}
            name={foeCreature?.display_name || "Unknown"}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={foeCreature?.stats.hp || 0}
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 border-t-2 border-gray-200">
        <div className="mb-4 h-24 overflow-y-auto bg-gray-100 p-2 rounded">
          <p>Battle in progress...</p>
        </div>
        <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill') && (
            <SkillButton
              key="skill-1"
              uid="skill-1"
              skillName="Tackle"
              description="A basic attack"
              stats="Damage: 10"
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes('use-skill')}
            />
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <Button onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}>
              Quit
            </Button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Layout Adjustments**: The layout is kept simple with `flex` properties to ensure proper alignment and spacing.
- **Rendering Efficiency**: The rendering logic is kept minimal to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **CSS Adjustments**: Ensure that CSS properties are not causing any layout issues that could lead to performance problems.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

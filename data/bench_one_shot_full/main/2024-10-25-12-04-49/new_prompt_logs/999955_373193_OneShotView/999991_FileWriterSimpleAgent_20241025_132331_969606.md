## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. The main container will be a flex column with items aligned center and justified between.

3. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top of the screen using large, bold text.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a separate section for buttons at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the entire view using Tailwind classes.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll use optional chaining and nullish coalescing operators to handle potential missing data gracefully.

8. Icons:
   We'll import and use Lucide icons for the buttons to enhance the visual appeal.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: d9e83dc4-100a-4a31-87b8-1cb28957e852
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
    emitButtonClick(slug);
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center">Creature Battle Game</h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
            className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 rounded-full text-xl font-semibold transition-colors duration-200"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
            Play
          </button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
            className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 rounded-full text-xl font-semibold transition-colors duration-200"
          >
            <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
            Quit
          </button>
        )}
      </div>

      <div className="text-sm opacity-70">
        Welcome, {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || 'Player'}!
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation follows the architecture described above and adheres to the requirements:

1. It uses the full screen with a 16:9 aspect ratio (controlled by the parent container).
2. The game title is prominently displayed at the top-center of the screen.
3. Play and Quit buttons are positioned at the bottom-center of the screen.
4. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, including a gradient background.
5. It handles potential missing data with optional chaining.
6. It uses Lucide icons for the buttons.
7. The component is responsive and will adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining the layout.

The component checks for available button slugs and only renders the buttons that are currently available. It also displays a welcome message with the player's name if available.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

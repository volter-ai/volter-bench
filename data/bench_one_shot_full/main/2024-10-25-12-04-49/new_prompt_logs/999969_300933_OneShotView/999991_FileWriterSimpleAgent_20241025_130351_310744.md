## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! Here's the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and ensuring full compliance with the guidelines:

# Excerpt ID: 42f7d5b7-f5ac-4d31-bad7-4933f6a0a30f
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  uid: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = data?.entities?.player?.display_name || "Player";

  if (!data || !data.uid) {
    return <div className="w-full h-full bg-gray-800 flex items-center justify-center text-white">Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" key={data.uid}>
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Creature Battle Game
      </div>

      <div className="text-2xl text-white">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This corrected version includes the following improvements:

1. Added a `uid` property to the `GameUIData` interface to ensure it's always present.
2. Used the `data.uid` as a key for the main container div, which helps React with efficient re-rendering.
3. Added a null check for the entire `data` object and its `uid` property. If either is missing, a loading screen is displayed.
4. Improved the null checking for the player name, using optional chaining for deeper nested properties.
5. Destructured the `data` prop in the component parameters for cleaner code.

These changes ensure that the component follows all the guidelines, including proper error handling and use of the `uid` property. The component now safely handles cases where data might be missing or incomplete, and it uses the `uid` as requested for custom components (in this case, applied to the main container).

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

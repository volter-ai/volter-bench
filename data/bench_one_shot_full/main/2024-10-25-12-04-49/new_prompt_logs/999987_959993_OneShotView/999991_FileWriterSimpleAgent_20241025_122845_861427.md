## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide a corrected version of the code that adheres more closely to the guidelines. Here's the updated MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: 82695745-e644-402d-a2d8-5f4f9cbd58fd
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data, uid }: { data: GameUIData; uid: string }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const getButtonIcon = (slug: string) => {
    switch (slug) {
      case 'play':
        return <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
      case 'quit':
        return <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />;
      default:
        return null;
    }
  };

  return (
    <Card className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center mt-16">
        Creature Adventure
      </h1>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
          <Button
            key={slug}
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
            className="bg-white text-purple-700 hover:bg-purple-100 mb-4 w-48"
          >
            {getButtonIcon(slug)}
            {slug.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + slug.slice(1)}
          </Button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the following points:

1. Added a `uid` prop to the MainMenuSceneView component, as required by the guidelines.
2. Imported and used shadcn components: `Button` and `Card`.
3. Kept the use of Tailwind classes for styling, maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio and full-screen layout.
4. Maintained the dynamic rendering of buttons based on `availableButtonSlugs`.
5. Kept the null-safe rendering approach.
6. Retained the Lucide React icons for buttons.
7. Simplified some of the custom styling by leveraging the shadcn Button component's built-in styles.

This version should now comply with all the provided guidelines while maintaining the desired functionality and appearance of the main menu scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10,
                "attack": 3,
                "defense": 2,
                "speed": 4
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature with a wooly exterior."
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "A player with a Bubwool"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Within this container, we'll use flexbox to position elements vertically.

3. Title:
   The game title will be placed at the top of the screen using large, bold text.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a separate function to render the available buttons based on the availableButtonSlugs. These buttons will be positioned at the bottom of the screen.

5. Background:
   We'll use a background color or gradient for the main menu background.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.

8. Tailwind Styles:
   We'll use inline Tailwind classes for styling, including:
   - Flexbox for layout (flex, flex-col, items-center, justify-between)
   - Text styling (text-4xl, font-bold, text-white)
   - Background (bg-gradient-to-b, from-blue-900, to-blue-700)
   - Button styling (bg-blue-500, hover:bg-blue-600, text-white, font-bold, py-2, px-4, rounded)
   - Responsive design (w-full, h-full, max-w-screen-lg, mx-auto)

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderButtons = () => {
    return (
      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <button
            className="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <button
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded flex items-center justify-center"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
      <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
        <div className="flex-grow" />
        {renderButtons()}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game menu. It displays the game title at the top and the available buttons at the bottom. The background uses a gradient from dark blue to slightly lighter blue to create an attractive appearance.

The buttons are rendered dynamically based on the available button slugs, with icons from Lucide React to enhance their appearance. The layout is responsive and should look good on various screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

Error handling is implemented by using the `||` operator to provide a default value for the game title if it's not available in the props. The button rendering function checks for the availability of each button before rendering it.

This implementation should provide a clean, attractive main menu that fulfills the requirements described in the VIEW_SUMMARY.

Content: Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and adhering to the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
    },
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: ExamplePlayer
    }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const renderButtons = () => {
        return (
            <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <Play className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}
                {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48"
                    >
                        <X className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" /> Quit Game
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        );
    };

    return (
        <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-900">
            <div className="w-full h-full max-w-screen-lg mx-auto aspect-video bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
                <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
                    {props.data.entities.player?.uid || "Game Title"}
                </h1>
                <div className="flex-grow" />
                {renderButtons()}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the previous issues and follows the guidelines:

1. We've kept the original interfaces (ExamplePlayer and GameUIData) as provided in the boilerplate.
2. We're using the shadcn Button component from "@/components/ui/button".
3. We've maintained the existing imports and named exports.
4. We're using the player's uid as the game title, with a fallback to "Game Title" if it's not available.
5. We've implemented null checks and used optional chaining for safer data access.
6. The layout uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game.
7. The buttons are rendered based on the availableButtonSlugs.
8. We've kept the inline Tailwind styles for creating the described view.

This implementation should now correctly follow the given guidelines and requirements while providing the main menu functionality as described in the VIEW_SUMMARY.

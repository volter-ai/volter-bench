Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because it's not properly handling the expected _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs when the game ends normally. The test should catch this exception as a valid end state, just like it catches RandomModeGracefulExit.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: cac0c5d3-d0d5-4cb3-bc50-eb7d19ebdca2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added explicit handling of other unexpected exceptions

This fix:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Doesn't modify any models
- Properly handles the expected game termination flow
- Maintains test coverage of the game scene
- Still catches RandomModeGracefulExit for early termination
- Preserves the ability to catch unexpected errors

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can end normally: either through RandomModeGracefulExit or through _QuitWholeGame when the game naturally ends via the quit button.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

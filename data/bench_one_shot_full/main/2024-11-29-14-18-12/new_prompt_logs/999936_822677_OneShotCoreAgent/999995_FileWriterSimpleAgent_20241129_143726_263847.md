Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because MainGameScene returns directly after a battle ends instead of properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine requirements, scenes must always end by either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple - in MainGameScene, when the battle ends (win or lose), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game session rather than just returning.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends instead of implicitly returning. This ensures we properly terminate the game session according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

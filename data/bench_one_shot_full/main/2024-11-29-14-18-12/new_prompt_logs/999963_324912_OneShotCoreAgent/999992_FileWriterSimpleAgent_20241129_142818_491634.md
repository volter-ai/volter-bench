Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how the main_menu_scene test handles transitions and quits.

We need to modify the test to:
- Catch the _QuitWholeGame exception as an expected end state
- Add proper assertions to verify the game ended correctly
- Follow the same pattern as the menu scene test for handling game termination

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: eae39470-7580-4927-88d0-8adc1662d258
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited via quit since this is the final scene
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game did not end with _quit_whole_game"
                    print("_quit_whole_game called")
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
- Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
- Added patching of _quit_whole_game to verify proper game termination
- Added assertions to ensure the game ends correctly
- Added proper cleanup in finally block
- Maintained the same testing pattern as the menu scene test

This maintains consistency with the engine's architecture while properly testing the game scene's termination behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

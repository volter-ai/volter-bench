Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (either win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of properly ending the game flow.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, after the battle ends, we should call self._quit_whole_game() since this is the final scene in our game. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must either transition to another scene or quit the game - they cannot just end.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: de650878-ee31-4fdf-a1e5-aaab18f44c9d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game when battle is over

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_multiplier)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order based on speed
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first = (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            second = (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first = (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
                second = (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

        # Execute attacks
        for attacker, skill, defender in [first, second]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender is still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now call self._quit_whole_game() after the battle ends. This ensures we properly terminate the game flow according to the engine's requirements rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is returning directly when the battle ends instead of properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine guidelines, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the scene by calling `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, since this is the final scene in our game flow.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
            
        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls whenever `check_battle_end()` returns True
2. This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's expected methods
3. No changes were needed to models or other architectural components
4. The fix maintains all engine guidelines and capabilities

The scene will now properly end the game when a battle concludes, rather than just returning from the run method.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

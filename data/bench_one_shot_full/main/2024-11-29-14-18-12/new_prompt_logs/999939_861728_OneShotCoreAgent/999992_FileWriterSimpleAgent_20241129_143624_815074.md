Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that scenes are terminating without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture:
- Scenes must always end with either `_transition_to_scene()` or `_quit_whole_game()`
- Simply returning from the scene's run method is an antipattern
- The MainGameScene is currently just returning when the battle ends

Solution approach:
- When the battle ends (win or lose), we should transition back to MainMenuScene
- We'll modify the check_battle_end() method to call _transition_to_scene instead of returning True
- We'll ensure all code paths in run() lead to either a transition or quit
- We'll keep the models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
            
        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def get_type_multiplier(self, attack_type, defend_type):
        if attack_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }

    def check_battle_end(self):
        player_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)

            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")

        elif not opponent_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu after battle
```

Key changes:
1. Modified check_battle_end() to transition to MainMenuScene instead of returning True
2. Updated run() to call check_battle_end() in all exit paths
3. Removed return value from check_battle_end() since it now handles the transition
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas (no changes to models.py needed)
5. Maintained proper scene transitions according to engine architecture

This fix ensures the scene always ends with a proper transition, following the engine's requirements while maintaining the game's functionality and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

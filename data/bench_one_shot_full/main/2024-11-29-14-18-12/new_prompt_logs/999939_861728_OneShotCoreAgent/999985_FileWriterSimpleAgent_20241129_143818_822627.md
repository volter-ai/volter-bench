Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
- The issue is that creature HP states aren't being reset when leaving the MainGameScene
- According to the docs: "When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures"
- We need to reset both player and opponent creatures to their max_hp
- This should happen before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
- We can't add methods to models since they must remain pure data schemas
- The reset logic should be in the scene itself

The solution will:
1. Add a reset_creatures() method to MainGameScene
2. Call it before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
3. Reset both player and opponent creatures
4. Keep models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added reset_creatures() method to MainGameScene
2. Called reset_creatures() before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
3. Reset method restores all creatures to their max_hp
4. Kept models as pure data schemas (no changes to models.py needed)
5. Maintained proper scene transitions
6. Reset applies to both player and opponent creatures

This fix ensures creature states are properly reset when leaving the battle scene while maintaining the architecture's requirements and keeping models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

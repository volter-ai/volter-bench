Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because BattleEndException is being raised but not properly handled in the game flow. In the engine architecture, we should:
- Use `_quit_whole_game()` for actual game ending conditions
- Use scene transitions for continuing gameplay
- Handle battle end as a game state transition rather than an exception

The solution is to:
- Remove the BattleEndException
- Use `_quit_whole_game()` in MainGameScene when the battle ends
- This aligns with how the engine expects scenes to handle completion

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 41518963-76e8-42c0-9392-df444df6f7a6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.opponent_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )

            # Opponent Choice Phase
            self.opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.opponent,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution Phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.check_battle_end(): break
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                if self.check_battle_end(): break
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
                    if self.check_battle_end(): break
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                else:
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
                    if self.check_battle_end(): break
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def execute_turn(self, attacker, defender):
        skill = attacker.skills[0]  # For now just use tackle
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed BattleEndException
2. Using `_quit_whole_game()` directly in check_battle_end()
3. Returning boolean from check_battle_end() to properly control the game loop

This aligns with the engine's architecture where:
- Scene transitions are handled by `_transition_to_scene`
- Game ending is handled by `_quit_whole_game`
- The engine's GracefulExit exception handling takes care of cleanup

The test will now pass because the engine properly handles the GracefulExit exception raised by `_quit_whole_game()`.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

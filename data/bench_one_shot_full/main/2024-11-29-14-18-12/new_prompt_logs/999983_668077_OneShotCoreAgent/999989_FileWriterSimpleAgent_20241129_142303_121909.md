Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because test_main_game_scene.py tries to import BattleEndException which was removed. The test needs to be updated to match the current implementation where we use `_quit_whole_game()` directly.

The solution is to:
- Remove the BattleEndException import
- Update the test to properly handle the GracefulExit exception from _quit_whole_game()
- Keep the test aligned with how the engine handles game completion

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d678275c-94a2-4d2c-912b-f460022b3b86
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                with patch.object(AbstractApp, '_QuitWholeGame', side_effect=RandomModeGracefulExit):
                    main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Game ended or random_mode_counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
```

Key changes:
1. Removed BattleEndException import
2. Added patch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to raise RandomModeGracefulExit
3. Simplified exception handling to catch RandomModeGracefulExit
4. Updated print message to be more accurate about why the run ended

This aligns with the engine architecture where:
- Game ending is handled through _quit_whole_game()
- Tests use RandomModeGracefulExit for graceful test completion
- The engine's exception handling manages cleanup

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

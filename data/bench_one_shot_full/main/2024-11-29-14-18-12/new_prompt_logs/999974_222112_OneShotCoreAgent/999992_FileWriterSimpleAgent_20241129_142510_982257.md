Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions since both are valid ways for the scene to end during random testing.

The fix is to update the test file to handle both expected exceptions. This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing both possible scene exit conditions.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5258651c-e139-465b-aa4b-a0a4fd96f2b0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added a catch-all exception handler that fails the test for unexpected exceptions
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing both possible ways the scene can end:
- RandomModeGracefulExit when random moves are exhausted
- _QuitWholeGame when the quit option is chosen

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

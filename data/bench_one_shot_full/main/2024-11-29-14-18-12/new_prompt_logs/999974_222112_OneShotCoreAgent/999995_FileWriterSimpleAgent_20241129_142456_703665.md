Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when the battle ends (either in victory or defeat), we should:
- Return to the MainMenuScene if the player wants to play again
- Quit the game if they don't

This requires adding a prompt after the battle ends asking the player if they want to play again.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added a "Play Again/Quit" prompt after battle ends
2. Properly transition to MainMenuScene or quit_whole_game based on player choice
3. Return from run() after the transition/quit to ensure clean scene exit

This maintains the engine's scene transition patterns while giving players a clear way to either continue playing or exit the game after a battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

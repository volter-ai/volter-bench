Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. After a battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to allow the player to play again
2. This maintains the game loop and follows the engine's scene transition requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c3594dee-765d-41db-a073-0484af57951d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            # Execute skills

            if self._check_battle_end():

                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        p1, c1, _ = action1
        p2, c2, _ = action2
        
        if c1.speed > c2.speed:
            return action1, action2
        elif c2.speed > c1.speed:
            return action2, action1
        else:
            return (action1, action2) if random.random() < 0.5 else (action2, action1)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self._get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def _get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender = self.opponent
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender = self.player
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends
2. Added `return` statements after the transitions to properly exit the scene
3. This ensures the scene always ends with a proper transition, following the engine's requirements

The rest of the implementation remains the same since the issue was specifically with scene flow control.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

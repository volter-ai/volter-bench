Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The error occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid choices. This happens because we're not checking if there are available creatures before showing the swap option. According to the game rules, we should:
- Only show "Swap" as an option if there are valid creatures to swap to
- Handle the case where a creature faints and there are no creatures to swap to
- Keep the code within the engine's capabilities by using the existing choice system

The fix will be in main_game_scene.py to:
1. Check for available creatures before showing the swap option
2. Properly handle the case where no swaps are available
3. Maintain proper error handling throughout

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

```

Key changes:
1. Added get_available_creatures helper method to centralize creature availability logic
2. Check for available creatures before showing swap option
3. Added null checks in the run loop for when no valid actions are available
4. Updated __str__ to only show swap option when available
5. Added check in resolve_turn to prevent second action if first action knocked out the creature
6. Improved type hints throughout
7. Reused get_available_creatures in handle_fainted_creature

These changes ensure we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player while maintaining the game's rules and the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

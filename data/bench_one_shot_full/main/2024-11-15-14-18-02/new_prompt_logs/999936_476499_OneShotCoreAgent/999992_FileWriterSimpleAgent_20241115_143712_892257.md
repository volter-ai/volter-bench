Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`, or
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

Looking at MainGameScene, when the battle ends (in check_battle_end()), it just returns True which breaks the game loop. Instead, it should call `_quit_whole_game()` since this is the end of the game flow.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

            self.opponent.active_creature = choice.thing
            
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when check_battle_end() returns True. This properly signals to the engine that the game is ending, rather than just breaking the loop.

This fix:
1. Follows the engine requirements by properly ending the scene
2. Maintains all the game logic
3. Doesn't modify any models
4. Keeps the scene architecture intact
5. Should resolve the test failure

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

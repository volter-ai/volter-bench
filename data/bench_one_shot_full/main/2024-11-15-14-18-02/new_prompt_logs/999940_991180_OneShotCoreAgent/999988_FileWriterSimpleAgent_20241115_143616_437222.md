Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The MainGameScene needs several fixes to match the architecture:

a) Add "Back" option during Player Choice Phase:
- When showing skills after "Attack", include a "Back" button
- When showing creatures after "Swap", include a "Back" button
- Return to main choice menu when "Back" is selected

b) Implement forced swapping when a creature is knocked out:
- After each attack, check if any creature was knocked out
- If so, force the owner to swap to another creature with HP > 0
- End battle if no creatures are available to swap to

c) Reset creature states when leaving scene:
- Add a cleanup method to reset all creatures to their max_hp
- Call cleanup before quitting or transitioning

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes made:
1. Added "Back" button to both Attack and Swap menus
2. Implemented proper handling of knocked out creatures with forced swapping
3. Added cleanup method to reset creatures when leaving scene
4. Added team status display to __str__
5. Updated battle flow to check for knockouts between actions
6. Made swaps always execute before attacks
7. Added proper creature state cleanup before ending scene

The implementation now fully matches the architecture description while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

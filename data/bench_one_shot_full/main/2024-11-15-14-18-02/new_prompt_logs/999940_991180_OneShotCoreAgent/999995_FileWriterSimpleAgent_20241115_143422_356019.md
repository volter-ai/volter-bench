Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that the MainGameScene is terminating without properly calling `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`. When the battle ends (either player wins or loses), we're just returning from the run method instead of properly ending the game.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when we detect the battle has ended (in check_battle_end), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` instead of just returning True. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}

    def check_battle_end(self):
        p_alive = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)
        o_alive = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.opponent.creatures)
        
        if not p_alive:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
        if not o_alive:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

Key changes made:
1. Changed check_battle_end to call `_quit_whole_game()` instead of returning True
2. Removed return statements in run() method that were breaking the game loop
3. Changed get_player_action to return None for invalid swaps instead of recursing
4. Made run() continue the loop if an action is None

This ensures the scene always ends properly through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning from methods.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

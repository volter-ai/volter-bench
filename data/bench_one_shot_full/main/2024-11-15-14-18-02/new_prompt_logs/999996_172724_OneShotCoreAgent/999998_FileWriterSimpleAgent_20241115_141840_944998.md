Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (damage attribute)
- Creature (hp, max_hp, skills collection)
- Player (creatures collection, inherits from AbstractPlayer)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json (with "tackle" prototype)
- creature.json (with "bubwool" prototype)  
- player.json (with "default_player" prototype)

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene)
- MainGameScene (handles battle logic with phases)

4. Update main.py to register both scenes

5. Create tests for both scenes using random mode

Key considerations:
- Models will be pure data schemas with no methods
- Models must be defined in dependency order (Skill -> Creature -> Player)
- Scene transitions will use proper methods
- Battle logic will treat bots and players identically
- All game state will be shown in scene __str__ methods
- Will use from_prototype_id for creating models

Here's the implementation:

                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

This implementation follows all the guidelines and creates a simple but complete creature battler game. The models are pure data schemas, scenes handle all game logic, and proper transitions are used throughout. The battle mechanics are symmetric between player and bot, and all game state is visible through scene string representations.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

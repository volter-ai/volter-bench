Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is terminating without properly calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. When the battle ends (either through a win or loss), we're just returning from the run() method instead of explicitly ending the scene.

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the scene by calling `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle is over, since this represents the end of a complete game session. This follows the engine's requirements that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls before each return in the run() method
2. This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's expected mechanisms rather than just returning
3. Using `_quit_whole_game()` is appropriate here since this represents the end of a complete game session
4. No changes were needed to the models or architecture, just proper scene termination

This should fix both test failures since:
1. The scene will now properly call quit_whole_game when ending
2. The tests will see these calls and pass their assertions

The fix stays within the engine's capabilities and maintains the separation between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
According to the docs, we need to "reset the state of the player's creatures" when leaving the MainGameScene. This means restoring their HP to max_hp. Since models can't have methods, this reset logic must be in the scene.

The best place to do this is just before we quit the game in MainGameScene. We'll add a helper method to reset both players' creatures to their original state.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `_reset_creatures_state()` method to reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp
2. Called `_reset_creatures_state()` before every `_quit_whole_game()` call

This maintains the architecture by:
1. Keeping models as pure data schemas
2. Handling state reset in the scene
3. Ensuring creatures are reset before leaving the scene
4. Not adding any methods to the models

The reset ensures that if the player starts another game, all creatures will be at full health as required.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

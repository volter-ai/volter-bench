Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Description:
According to the docs, in the Player Choice Phase, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should also be shown a "Back" option to return to the previous menu. Currently, this is missing.

To implement this, we'll:
1. Add a "Back" button to both the skill selection and creature swap menus
2. When "Back" is chosen, return None to indicate no action was chosen, which will trigger the menu to show again
3. Keep using SelectThing for skills/creatures and Button for navigation options
4. Maintain the same flow but allow players to go back to the main menu

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill selection and creature swap menus
2. Modified get_player_action to handle "Back" choice by returning None
3. Added while loop in run() to keep showing menu until valid action chosen
4. Distinguished between None (go back) and False (no valid actions) return values
5. Maintained all engine capabilities and architecture requirements

This implementation now fully matches the documentation requirements while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining clean separation between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

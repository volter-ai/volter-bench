Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is set up to catch TransitionFromScene, but we're using _quit_whole_game() to end the battle. We should modify the test to also catch the _QuitWholeGame exception.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 79c700aa-a70d-4395-aa4d-2037b0aa62f7
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called
                    print("Scene transition called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game quits gracefully

This maintains the engine architecture while properly handling all possible ways the scene can end:
- Via transition (TransitionFromScene)
- Via game quit (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame)
- Via random mode timeout (RandomModeGracefulExit)

The test will now pass since it properly catches the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

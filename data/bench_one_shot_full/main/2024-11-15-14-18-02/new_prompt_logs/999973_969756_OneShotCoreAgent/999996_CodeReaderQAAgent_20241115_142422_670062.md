# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | "water" type | 10 hp | 3 attack | 2 defense | 4 speed | Skills: ["Tackle", "Lick"]
- "Scizard" | "fire" type | 11 hp | 3 attack | 3 defense | 3 speed | Skills: ["Tackle", "Fireball"]

# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" | Has a bubwool
- "Basic Opponent" | Has a scizard

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" | "normal" type | 3 damage | "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
- "Fireball" | "fire" type | 2 damage | "Throw fire at a foe, dealing damage."
- "Lick" | "water" type | 2 damage | "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's resistance to damage against attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainMenuScene

- [x] The Main Menu scene displays a welcome message to the player.
  - **Code Check**: The `MainMenuScene` class in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` calls `_show_text` with a welcome message. This matches the requirement.
  
- [x] The Main Menu scene provides an option to start the game, which transitions to the MainGameScene.
  - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` provides a "Play" button that transitions to "MainGameScene". This matches the requirement.
  
- [x] The Main Menu scene provides an option to quit the game entirely.
  - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` provides a "Quit" button that calls `_quit_whole_game`. This matches the requirement.

### MainGameScene

- [x] The Main Game Scene allows a human player to battle against a bot player.
  - **Code Check**: The `MainGameScene` class in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` initializes a bot opponent. This matches the requirement.

- [x] The game consists of repeating turns with distinct phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
  - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainGameScene` implements these phases. This matches the requirement.

#### Player Choice Phase

- [x] During the Player Choice Phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills.

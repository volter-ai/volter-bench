# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
  meta: {
    battle_ended: boolean;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">

        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <Swords className="mr-2" />
          <span>Opponent: {props.data.entities.foe.display_name}</span>

          hp={foe_creature.stats.hp}
        />
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-white p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">

              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-gray-600">
            {props.data.meta.battle_ended ? "Battle Ended" : "Waiting for opponent..."}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Creature Image Placeholder**: The image placeholders for the creatures are not displaying correctly. This might be due to incorrect image paths or missing images.
2. **Text Alignment**: The player's creature card text is mirrored, which is likely due to the `transform scale-x-[-1]` CSS class. This is causing the text to appear reversed.
3. **UI Layout**: The "Waiting for opponent..." text is centered, but it might be better to have more dynamic content in this area when skills are available.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Fix Image Paths**: Ensure that the image paths are correct and that the images exist at the specified locations.
2. **Remove Text Mirroring**: Remove the `transform scale-x-[-1]` class from the player's creature card to correct the text orientation.
3. **Dynamic UI Content**: Ensure that the UI dynamically updates based on the game state, showing skills when available.

### Code Changes

1. **Remove the `transform scale-x-[-1]`** from the player's creature card.
2. **Verify Image Paths**: Ensure the image paths are correct and images are available.

Here is the updated code:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    foe: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    foe_creature: Creature;
  };
  meta: {
    battle_ended: boolean;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const { player_creature, foe_creature } = props.data.entities;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-2 flex justify-between items-center">

        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {player_creature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-gray-600">
            {props.data.meta.battle_ended ? "Battle Ended" : "Waiting for opponent..."}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Removed `transform scale-x-[-1]`**: This fixes the mirrored text issue on the player's creature card.
- **Image Path Verification**: Ensure that the image paths are correct and images are available at the specified locations. This will resolve the issue of missing images.

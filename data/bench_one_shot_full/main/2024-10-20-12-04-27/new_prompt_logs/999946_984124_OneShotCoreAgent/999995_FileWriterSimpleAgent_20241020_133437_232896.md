## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle loop to properly handle the end of the battle and return a boolean indicating whether the player won or lost.
3. We'll add a method to display the battle result and prompt the player to return to the main menu.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ec473b5a-bdaa-4a13-942c-75f0e97f8870
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")
        player_won = self.battle_loop()
        self.show_battle_result(player_won)
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            if self.battle_turn():
                return self.player_creature.hp > 0

    def battle_turn(self):
        player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
        return self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        battle_end = self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not battle_end:
            battle_end = self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

        return battle_end

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)

        attacker_player = self.player if attacker == self.player_creature else self.opponent
        defender_player = self.opponent if attacker == self.player_creature else self.player

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

        if defender.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} is knocked out!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_player.display_name} wins the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def show_battle_result(self, player_won):
        result_message = "Congratulations! You won the battle!" if player_won else "You lost the battle. Better luck next time!"
        self._show_text(self.player, result_message)
        
        continue_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [continue_button])
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `run` method to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. Updating the `battle_loop` to return a boolean indicating whether the player won or lost.
3. Adding a `show_battle_result` method to display the battle outcome and prompt the player to return to the main menu.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This should resolve both the test failures and the FixableException that was being raised.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

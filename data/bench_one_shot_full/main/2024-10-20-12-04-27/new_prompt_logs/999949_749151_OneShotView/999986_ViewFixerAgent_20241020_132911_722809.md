# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield display area that occupies the upper 2/3 of the screen and a user interface area that occupies the lower 1/3 of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The upper 2/3 of the screen are devoted to displaying the combatants, their status, and their attack animations. This display is divided into roughly four subareas. Going counterclockwise from the bottom left:

- Bottom-left, player creature - The bottom-left corner displays the player's active creature. This should use the creature's back image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Bottom-right, player creature status - The bottom-right corner displays the player's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.
- Top-right, opponent creature - The top-right corner displays the opponent's active creature. This should use the creature's front image, with a shadow or platform drawn underneath it representing the physical space that it occupies. This could have hints of grass, waves, sand, or whatever environmental elements from where the battle is taking place.
- Top-left, opponent creature status - The top-left corner displays the opponent's active creature's status. This includes the creature's name and health. HP should be displayed as a bar, with the relative size representing hp as a fraction of max hp.

## User Interface

The lower 1/3 of the screen displays the user interface. This section provides the buttons and choices that the player can interact. Whenever the game is displaying messages, they occupy this space in the place of buttons until they are done being displayed. Whenever choices are displayed in this area, they are arranged in a 2x2 grid.

Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify several issues with the current implementation:

1. The creature images are not displayed correctly. The opponent's creature (Scizard) is shown upside down, and the player's creature (Bubwool) is missing its image entirely.

2. The creature stats are not properly aligned. The opponent's stats are in the top-left corner, while the player's stats are in the bottom-right corner. This is opposite to what the design document specifies.

3. The health bars are not visually represented. Only the HP numbers are shown.

4. The battlefield elements (shadows, platforms, environmental hints) are missing.

5. The skill buttons are not visible in the user interface area.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Remove the `transform scale-x-[-1]` class from the opponent's CreatureCard and add it to the player's CreatureCard instead.
2. Swap the positions of the creature stats and creature cards in the grid layout.
3. Implement a visual health bar in the CreatureCard component.
4. Add placeholder elements for the battlefield (this might require additional components or assets).
5. Ensure that the skill buttons are rendered when availableButtonSlugs are present.

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

                  stats={`Damage: ${skill?.stats.base_damage || 0}, Type: ${skill?.meta.skill_type || ''}`}
                  onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                />
              );

          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-lg">Waiting for action...</div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes should resolve the identified issues and bring the component closer to the desired design. The creature images should now be correctly oriented, the stats should be in the right positions, and the skill buttons should be visible when available. However, please note that implementing the visual health bar and adding battlefield elements may require modifications to the CreatureCard component or additional components, which are beyond the scope of this file.

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that will render the entire main menu scene.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. This will ensure the content is properly positioned and responsive.

3. Title Display:
   We'll create a placeholder for the game title at the top of the screen using large text and appropriate styling.

4. Button Layout:
   We'll create a container for the buttons at the bottom of the screen, using flexbox to arrange them vertically.

5. Button Rendering:
   We'll map through the available button slugs and render a button for each one. We'll use the `Button` component from shadcn/ui for consistency.

6. Background:
   We'll add a background color to the entire view to simulate a background image (since we're not using actual image assets).

7. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

Using Tailwind for Styling:
We'll use inline Tailwind classes to achieve the desired layout and appearance. Key classes we'll use include:

- `flex`, `flex-col`, and `items-center` for centering and vertical layout
- `w-full` and `h-full` for full-width and height
- `text-` classes for font sizes and colors
- `p-` and `m-` classes for padding and margins
- `bg-` classes for background colors

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: ec0126f0-2722-4a71-984f-20c84c4206b3
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col items-center justify-between bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 text-white p-8">
      <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-center shadow-lg">
          {props.data.display_name || "Game Title"}
        </h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
          if (!config) return null;

          return (
            <Button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="w-48 text-lg flex items-center justify-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </Button>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and buttons at the bottom. It uses the available button slugs to render the appropriate buttons, and includes icons for better visual appeal. The layout is responsive and centered, adhering to the 16:9 aspect ratio of the game container.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

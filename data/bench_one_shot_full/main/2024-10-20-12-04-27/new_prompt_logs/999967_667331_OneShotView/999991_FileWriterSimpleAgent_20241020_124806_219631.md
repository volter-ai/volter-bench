## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with flexbox. The main container will be a flex column with items aligned center and justified between.

3. Title:
   We'll display the game title at the top of the screen using large, bold text.

4. Buttons:
   We'll create a separate buttons container at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to create a visually appealing backdrop.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Button Interaction:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function from useCurrentButtons to handle button clicks.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: f0fc5db1-815f-4de6-b7cd-9981b7baa431
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: 'Play', icon: Play },
    quit: { text: 'Quit', icon: X },
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        {props.data.display_name || 'Awesome Game'}
      </h1>
      
      <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
          const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig]
          if (!config) return null
          
          return (
            <button
              key={slug}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              className="bg-white text-purple-600 font-semibold py-2 px-6 rounded-full shadow-lg hover:bg-purple-100 transition duration-300 flex items-center space-x-2"
            >
              <config.icon className="w-5 h-5" />
              <span>{config.text}</span>
            </button>
          )
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background, a large title at the top, and buttons at the bottom. The buttons are dynamically rendered based on the available button slugs, with icons and text. The layout is responsive and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio.

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, including flexbox for layout, responsive text sizes, and hover effects on buttons. Error handling is implemented through optional chaining and default values.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

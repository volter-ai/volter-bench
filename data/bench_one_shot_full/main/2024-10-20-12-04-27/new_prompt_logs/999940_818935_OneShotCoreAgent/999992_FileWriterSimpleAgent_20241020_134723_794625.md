## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' in the App class. The error occurs because we haven't imported the necessary scene classes in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `main.py` file to import both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` from their respective modules.
2. We'll ensure that the imports are at the top of the file, after the imports from the engine.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 18ebd180-79b5-44ec-b5bc-88b8dae3abeb
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This change should resolve the NameError while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. We've added the necessary imports for both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`, which should allow the App class to properly register these scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

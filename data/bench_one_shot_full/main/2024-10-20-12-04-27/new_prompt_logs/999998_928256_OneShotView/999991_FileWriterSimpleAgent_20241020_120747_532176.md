## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach, and then provide the updated code for the MainMenuSceneView component.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two main sections: the title area at the top and the button area at the bottom.

3. Title Display:
   We'll create a large, centered title area at the top of the screen using Tailwind classes for positioning and styling.

4. Button Display:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs from useCurrentButtons to dynamically render available buttons. Each button will be styled consistently and placed in the bottom-center of the screen.

5. Background:
   We'll add a simple background color or gradient using Tailwind classes to give the main menu a polished look.

6. Responsiveness:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and default values to handle cases where expected data might be missing.

8. Interactions:
   We'll use the emitButtonClick function from useCurrentButtons to handle button clicks.

Now, let's implement the MainMenuSceneView component:

# Excerpt ID: e01973a3-3066-469b-b16f-0e61853f0497
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] aspect-video bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center">
            {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Welcome to the Game"}
          </h1>
        </div>
        <div className="flex gap-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
            const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
            if (!config) return null;
            const Icon = config.icon;
            return (
              <button
                key={slug}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                className="px-6 py-3 bg-white text-purple-600 rounded-lg font-semibold text-lg flex items-center gap-2 hover:bg-purple-100 transition-colors"
              >
                <Icon size={24} />
                {config.text}
              </button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene with the following features:

1. A full-screen layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio, using Tailwind's aspect-video class.
2. A gradient background that transitions from blue to purple.
3. A semi-transparent black overlay to improve text readability.
4. A large, centered title at the top, which displays the player's name if available, or a default welcome message.
5. Dynamically rendered buttons at the bottom, based on the available button slugs.
6. Each button has an icon and text, with a consistent style and hover effect.
7. The component handles missing data gracefully, providing fallbacks where necessary.
8. The layout is responsive and will maintain its aspect ratio on different screen sizes.

This implementation should provide a visually appealing and functional main menu scene that meets the requirements described in the VIEW_SUMMARY.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a new method called `_reset_creatures_state` to the `MainGameScene` class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max HP.
3. We'll call this method at the end of the `run` method, just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This solution adds the `_reset_creatures_state` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent. It's called at the end of the `run` method, just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`. This ensures that if the game is replayed without restarting the application, all creatures will start with full health, addressing the issue raised in the QA pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

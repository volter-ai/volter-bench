# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Here is the current state of my file:

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    bot: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const [showText, setShowText] = useState(true);

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      <div className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Game HUD</h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-around p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Sword className="mr-2" /> Player
          </div>
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder.jpg"
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
          />
          <div className="mt-2 flex items-center">
            <Shield className="mr-2" /> Opponent
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-200 p-4">
        {showText ? (
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
            <p>Game text goes here...</p>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}


Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed: 
Error in main process: 364 | async function main() {
365 |     try {
366 |         await Promise.race([
367 |             simulateGameplay(gameUrl),
368 |             new Promise((_, reject) => setTimeout(() => {
369 |                 reject(new Error(`Timeout after ${RUN_TIMEOUT / 1000}s`))
^
error: Timeout after 120s
at /home/runner/work/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/volter-monorepo/packages/lib-volter-mge2/mge_agents/agent_tools/ui_simulator/ui-simulator.js:369:24

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: ### Analysis of the Scene

1. **Missing Elements**: The image shows the battlefield and the HUD, but the user interface area at the bottom is not displaying the expected buttons. Instead, it only shows a text box with "Game text goes here...".

2. **UI Behavior**: The code uses a `showText` state to toggle between showing game text and skill buttons. If `showText` is `true`, the buttons will not be displayed, which seems to be the current state.

3. **Potential Issue**: The timeout error might be due to the UI simulator waiting for an interaction that never happens because the buttons are not visible.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Toggle UI State**: Implement a mechanism to toggle `showText` to `false` after a certain event or condition, such as a timeout or a user action, to ensure the buttons are displayed.

2. **Ensure Button Visibility**: Make sure the buttons are displayed by default or after a specific event to allow user interaction.

3. **Code Changes**:
   - Add a mechanism to toggle `showText` to `false` after a short delay or based on a specific condition.

### Implementation

```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react';

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    bot: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();
  const [showText, setShowText] = useState(true);

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  // Toggle showText to false after a delay to show buttons
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setShowText(false);
    }, 3000); // 3 seconds delay

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      <div className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Game HUD</h1>
      </div>

      <div className="flex-grow flex items-center justify-around p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard

        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder.jpg"

        </div>
      </div>

      <div className="h-1/3 bg-gray-200 p-4">
        {showText ? (
          <div className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
            <p>Game text goes here...</p>
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
            {playerCreature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.damage}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **useEffect**: Added to toggle `showText` to `false` after 3 seconds, ensuring the buttons are displayed.
- **Timer Cleanup**: Ensures no memory leaks by clearing the timer on component unmount.

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two sections: the top section for the game title and the bottom section for the buttons.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title using a large, bold text at the top of the screen.

4. Buttons:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from the useCurrentButtons hook to dynamically render and handle button clicks. We'll create buttons for "Play" and "Quit" if they're available.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to give it a game-like appearance.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `flex` and `flex-col` to create a column layout for the main container.
- `justify-between` will be used to space out the title and button sections.
- `items-center` will center the content horizontally.
- We'll use `text-4xl` or similar for the large game title.
- For buttons, we'll use `px-4 py-2 rounded` for padding and rounded corners, along with background colors.
- To maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio, we'll use a container with `aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9` classes.

Now, let's implement the component:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      display_name: string;
    };
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 w-full max-w-4xl">
        <div className="flex flex-col justify-between items-center p-8 h-full">
          <div className="text-center">
            <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Creature Battle</h1>
            <p className="text-xl text-white">Welcome, {playerName}!</p>
          </div>
          
          <div className="space-y-4">
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
              <button
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
                className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 px-4 py-2 text-lg font-semibold text-white bg-green-500 rounded hover:bg-green-600 transition-colors"
              >
                <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
                Play
              </button>
            )}
            {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
              <button
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
                className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 px-4 py-2 text-lg font-semibold text-white bg-red-500 rounded hover:bg-red-600 transition-colors"
              >
                <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
                Quit
              </button>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene with a gradient background, centered content, and dynamically rendered buttons based on the available button slugs. The layout maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio and uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. The component also handles potential missing data by using optional chaining and providing default values.

                className="w-48 text-lg"
              >
                <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
                Quit
              </Button>
            )}
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This corrected version addresses the following issues:

1. It uses the `uid` prop from the `GameUIData` as a key for the main container div, ensuring unique rendering when the data changes.
2. It uses the shadcn `Button` component instead of custom button elements.
3. It handles potential missing data more robustly:
   - The `Player` interface makes the `display_name` optional.
   - The `GameUIData` interface makes the `player` entity optional.
   - The `playerName` is set using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value if `display_name` is undefined.
4. The component destructures the `data` prop directly in the function parameters for cleaner code.
5. The styling and layout remain consistent with the previous version, maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio and responsive design.

This version should now comply with the guidelines and handle data more safely.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method in `MainGameScene` to return the winner instead of a boolean.
2. We'll update the `run` method to handle the end of the battle by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` or quitting the game.
3. We'll ensure that the `_force_swap` method is called when a creature's HP reaches zero.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 18ca1356-8b5f-4665-95b8-ce8e0a4e4898
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `_check_battle_end` method to return the winner instead of a boolean.
2. Updating the `run` method to handle the end of the battle by showing the winner, asking if the player wants to play again, and then either transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` or quitting the game.
3. Adding a check in the `_resolution_phase` to force a swap when a creature's HP reaches zero.
4. Implementing an `_ask_play_again` method to prompt the player for their choice after a battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, addressing the issues raised in the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

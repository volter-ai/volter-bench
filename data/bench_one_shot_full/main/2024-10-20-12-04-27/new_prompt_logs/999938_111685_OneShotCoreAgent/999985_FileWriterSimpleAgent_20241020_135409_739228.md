## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase when selecting an attack or swap.
2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase`, `_choose_attack`, and `_choose_swap` methods to include a 'Back' option.
2. We'll add a `_reset_creatures_state` method to reset the state of all creatures, and call it when transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1c4110eb-3e70-40a3-9e2a-e81bdfdc70df
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

        self.opponent.active_creature = None
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a 'Back' option in the `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main choice phase.
2. Implementing a `_reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum values and clears the active creature for both players.
3. Calling `_reset_creatures_state` before transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These modifications ensure that the `MainGameScene` includes a 'Back' option in the player choice phase and properly resets the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene, addressing the issues raised in the QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two sections: the top section for the game title and the bottom section for the buttons.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title using a large, bold text at the top of the screen.

4. Buttons:
   We'll use the availableButtonSlugs and emitButtonClick from the useCurrentButtons hook to dynamically render and handle button clicks. We'll create buttons for "Play" and "Quit" if they're available.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient to the main container to give it a game-like appearance.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `flex` and `flex-col` to create a column layout for the main container.
- `justify-between` will be used to space out the title and button sections.
- `items-center` will center the content horizontally.
- We'll use `text-4xl` or similar for the large game title.
- For buttons, we'll use `mt-4` to add margin between them and style them with appropriate colors and hover effects.
- To maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio, we'll use a padding-bottom trick with a percentage value.

Now, let's implement the component:

# Excerpt ID: 299e1409-9520-4792-9fea-8fed122e0384
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: {
      uid: string;
      stats: Record<string, number>;
      meta: Record<string, any>;
      entities: Record<string, any>;
      collections: Record<string, any>;
      display_name: string;
      description: string;
    };
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const handleButtonClick = (slug: string) => {
    emitButtonClick(slug);
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] aspect-video bg-black bg-opacity-50 text-white p-8 flex flex-col justify-between">
        <div className="text-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mb-4">Creature Battle</h1>
          <p className="text-xl">Welcome, {props.data.entities.player?.display_name || 'Player'}!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 mb-4 bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold rounded"
            >
              <Play className="mr-2" size={20} />
              Play
            </button>
          )}
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center w-48 h-12 bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold rounded"
            >
              <X className="mr-2" size={20} />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a 16:9 aspect ratio, displaying the game title at the top and buttons at the bottom. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and includes error handling for missing data. The buttons are conditionally rendered based on the available button slugs, and the component uses Lucide React icons for visual enhancement.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to call the 'reset_creatures' method when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. This will ensure that the state of the player's creatures is reset, aligning with the architecture documentation.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene's run method to call reset_creatures before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll ensure that the reset_creatures method is called regardless of whether the player won or lost the battle.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 319190da-afcb-4ea1-952b-b9c9b4041141
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.opponent_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "Creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Calling the `reset_creatures` method in the `run` method, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. Ensuring that the creatures' health is reset regardless of the battle outcome.
3. Adding a message to inform the player that the creatures have been restored to full health.

These changes align with the architecture documentation and ensure that the state of the player's creatures is properly reset when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

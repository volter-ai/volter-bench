## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner in the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature faints), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of just ending the scene.
2. We'll add a loop in the run method to allow for multiple battles, only breaking when the player chooses to quit.
3. We'll add an option for the player to quit the game after each battle.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 09750dc4-f5ef-4339-9f91-b7e7e7ae3f03
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._reset_battle()
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
            
            while True:
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    break

        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s turn!")
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")

    def _ask_play_again(self) -> bool:
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])
        return choice == play_again_button
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or allowing the player to quit the game. The scene will now loop through multiple battles until the player chooses to quit, which should satisfy the requirements of the random run test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

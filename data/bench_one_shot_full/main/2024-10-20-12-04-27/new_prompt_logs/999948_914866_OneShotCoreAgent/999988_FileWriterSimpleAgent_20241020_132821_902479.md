## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight. You're right, and I'll address this issue by following the guidelines more strictly. Here's how we'll fix the problem:

1. We'll remove the `reset_creatures` method from the `Player` class in `models.py`. As per the guidelines, models should be pure data schemas without methods.

2. Instead of adding a method to the `Player` class, we'll implement the reset functionality directly in the `MainGameScene` class. This adheres to the guideline that all logic should be implemented in scenes.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c4f28562-404d-4eaf-813c-8d57d141d868
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

Now, let's update the `main_game_scene.py` file to incorporate the reset functionality:

# Excerpt ID: 6f32e415-9c02-4449-aacb-70581b2a3c5d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")

            self._quit_whole_game()

    def reset_creatures(self, player):
        for creature in player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issue raised in the QA report:

1. The `Player` class in `models.py` is now a pure data schema without any methods, adhering to the guidelines.
2. The reset functionality has been moved to the `MainGameScene` class as a `reset_creatures` method, which resets the HP of all creatures for a given player.
3. The `handle_battle_end` method now calls `reset_creatures` for both the player and the opponent before transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These modifications should resolve the AttributeError and align the code with the described architecture and guidelines.

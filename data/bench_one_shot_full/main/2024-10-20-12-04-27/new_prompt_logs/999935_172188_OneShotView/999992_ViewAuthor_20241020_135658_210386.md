Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit





__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Inside this container, we'll use flexbox to position the title at the top and the buttons at the bottom.

3. Title:
   We'll create a large, centered title using Tailwind classes for styling.

4. Buttons:
   We'll map through the available button slugs and create buttons for each one. We'll use the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient using Tailwind classes.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

8. Icons:
   We'll use Lucide icons for the buttons to enhance the visual appeal.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `min-h-screen` and `flex` to create a full-height container.
- `aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9` will maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio.
- `flex-col justify-between` will position the title at the top and buttons at the bottom.
- `text-4xl md:text-6xl` for responsive title size.
- `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4` for responsive button layout.
- `bg-gradient-to-b` for a gradient background.

Now, let's rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-4xl aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex flex-col justify-between p-8">
        <div className="text-center">
          <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Creature Battle</h1>
          <p className="text-xl text-white">Welcome, {playerName}!</p>
        </div>

        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
            const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
            if (!config) return null;

            return (
              <button
                key={slug}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                className="flex items-center justify-center bg-white bg-opacity-20 hover:bg-opacity-30 text-white py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition duration-300"
              >
                <config.icon className="mr-2" size={24} />
                {config.text}
              </button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene with a gradient background, centered title, and buttons at the bottom. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide icons for the buttons. The component is designed to handle missing data gracefully and adapts to different screen sizes.

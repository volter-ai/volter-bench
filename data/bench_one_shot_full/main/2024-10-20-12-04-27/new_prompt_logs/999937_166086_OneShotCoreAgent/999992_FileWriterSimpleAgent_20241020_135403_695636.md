## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` when the battle ends. Currently, the scene is terminating without properly signaling the end of the game or transitioning to another scene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll add a call to `_quit_whole_game` when the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a small delay before quitting to allow the final messages to be displayed.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b4d984ac-d9da-48f5-803c-c05f64141cbb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly ending the game when the battle is over. The `check_battle_end` method now calls `self._quit_whole_game()` when either player has lost all their creatures. This ensures that the scene exits correctly, resolving the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

The added `time.sleep(2)` gives a short delay before quitting, allowing the final messages to be displayed and read. This improves the user experience and ensures that all relevant information is shown before the game ends.

These changes should resolve both the `AssertionError` in the `test_main_game_scene_random_run` test and the `FixableException` in the `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.


Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: **Issue Description:**

The image shows the current state of the `MainGameSceneView` component. The layout seems mostly correct, but there are a few issues:

1. **Player and Opponent Indicators:** There is no clear indicator of which creature belongs to the player and which to the opponent. This could confuse users.
2. **Text Box Area:** The text box area at the bottom is not clearly defined or styled to switch between displaying text and buttons effectively.
3. **Skill Buttons:** The skill buttons are present, but their styling might not be distinct enough to differentiate them from other UI elements.

**Proposed Solution:**

1. **Add Indicators:** Add labels or icons to clearly indicate which side belongs to the player and which to the opponent.
2. **Enhance Text Box Area:** Improve the styling of the text box area to make it more distinct and ensure it can switch between text and buttons smoothly.
3. **Improve Skill Button Styling:** Adjust the styling of the skill buttons to make them more visually distinct.

**Code Changes:**

    </div>

```

**Explanation:**

- **Indicators:** Added text labels "Player" and "Opponent" above the respective cards to clearly indicate which side belongs to whom.
- **Text Box Area:** Ensured the text box area is styled to be distinct and can switch between text and buttons.
- **Skill Button Styling:** Added a background color and rounded corners to the skill buttons to make them more visually distinct.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important aspect of the game mechanics. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated MainGameScene file.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement the correct turn order based on creature speed, we'll make the following changes:

a. In the MainGameScene class, we'll create a new method called `_determine_turn_order` that compares the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.

b. If the speeds are different, this method will return a tuple with the faster creature first and the slower creature second.

c. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's random.choice to randomly decide which creature goes first.

d. We'll modify the main battle loop to use this new turn order, executing skills in the correct sequence.

e. We'll create a new method called `_execute_turn` that handles a single creature's turn, including skill selection and execution.

These changes will ensure that the creature with higher speed always acts first, and in case of equal speeds, the first actor is randomly determined. This implementation adheres to the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Updated MainGameScene file:

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by correctly implementing the turn order based on creature speed and randomly deciding the first actor when speeds are equal. The main battle logic has been refactored to use these new methods, ensuring that the game mechanics align with the described architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with an empty list of choices. This happens in `get_player_action` when trying to swap creatures. The issue is that we're not checking if there are any valid creatures to swap to before presenting the swap option.

The fix should:
1. Only show the "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Keep the "Attack" button always available since creatures always have at least one skill
3. Stay within the engine's capabilities by using the existing choice system
4. Not modify the models since they should remain pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `get_valid_swap_creatures` helper method to centralize the logic for finding valid swap targets
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show the Swap button if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Updated the scene's `__str__` to only show the Swap option when it's available
4. Left all the models and other architecture unchanged since this was purely a logic issue in the scene

This should fix the test failures by ensuring we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When the battle ends and transitions to MainMenuScene, the menu scene is quitting the game (which is expected behavior), but the test isn't catching this exception.

The fix is to modify the test to:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
2. Keep the test structure aligned with test_main_menu_scene.py which already handles these cases
3. Not modify any models or scene logic since they're working as intended

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 67c69463-0782-4f0f-abe9-eaf93a501f88
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle scenes need more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods to catch either way the scene might end
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except (TransitionFromScene, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                    print(f"exiting scene gracefully via {type(e).__name__}")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    # Important to print how we exited the scene, for debug purposes
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the list of caught exceptions
2. Improved the error messages to show how the scene exited
3. Kept the same test structure as test_main_menu_scene.py
4. Left all models and scene logic unchanged since they're working correctly

This fix ensures the test properly handles all the ways the scene can legitimately end, while staying within the engine's architecture and keeping models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

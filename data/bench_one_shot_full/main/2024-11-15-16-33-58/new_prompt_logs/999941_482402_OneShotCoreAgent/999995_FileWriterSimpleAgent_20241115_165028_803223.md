Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're not handling the case when a player has no valid choices for swapping creatures. This happens when:
1. A player chooses "Swap" but has no other creatures with HP > 0 to swap to
2. A creature is knocked out but there are no other creatures with HP > 0 to swap to

The solution is to:
1. Only show the "Swap" button if the player has valid creatures to swap to
2. Handle the case where a player has no creatures to swap to when their active creature is knocked out by ending the battle

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: b2a04dd4-d753-485e-8289-8ef984c24956

        # Reset creature HP
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

```

The key changes are:
1. Only showing the "Swap" button if the player has valid creatures to swap to
2. Removing the separate handle_knockout method and integrating its logic into execute_attack
3. Adding a check for available creatures before attempting to swap after a knockout

This ensures we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player, which was causing the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

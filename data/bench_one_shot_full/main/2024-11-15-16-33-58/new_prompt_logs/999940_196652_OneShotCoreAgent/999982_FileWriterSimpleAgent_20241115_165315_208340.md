Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:

The two issues to fix are:
a) Missing "Back" option in Player Choice Phase
b) Not resetting creature state when leaving scene

For (a), we need to:
- Add "Back" button to skill and swap choices
- Handle back button by returning to main choice menu
- Use a loop in get_player_action to allow returning to main menu

For (b), we need to:
- Add a reset method that restores all creatures to their max_hp
- Call this when the scene ends, before quitting

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
2. Implemented a loop in get_player_action to handle returning to main menu
3. Added reset_creatures method to restore creature HP
4. Call reset_creatures before quitting the game
5. Kept all models as pure data schemas
6. Maintained engine capabilities and architecture

This implementation now matches the specifications completely while maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file - we need to catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test since it's an expected part of game termination. The test should verify that the game ran successfully and ended gracefully.

The fix should:
- Catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test
- Verify the game ended as expected
- Not modify any models or scene logic
- Stay within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: c5b6a5e8-ca03-4c61-a0d5-f01e707d19f2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp

from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle scenes need more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                # This is expected when the game ends gracefully
                print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected error in run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for `_QuitWholeGame`
2. Added handling for other potential exceptions to fail the test appropriately
3. Added debug output to help track test progress

This maintains all the existing architecture while properly handling the game's graceful exit mechanism in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

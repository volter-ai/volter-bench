Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid choices. This happens because:
- We're not checking if there are any available creatures before offering the swap option
- We need to handle the case where all non-active creatures are knocked out

The fix should:
- Only show the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
- Keep the scene stateless between turns
- Not modify the models
- Stay within engine capabilities by using _wait_for_choice properly

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `has_available_swaps()` helper method to check if swapping is possible
2. Modified choice logic to only show "Swap" when valid swaps exist
3. Updated `__str__` to conditionally show swap option
4. Added check in resolve_actions to only execute second action if target still has HP
5. Kept all models and other architecture the same

This maintains the scene/model separation while fixing the empty choices error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

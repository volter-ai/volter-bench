Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is a NameError because 'uuid' is not imported in main.py. This is a simple import issue that can be fixed by adding the import statement at the top of main.py.

The fix is straightforward - we just need to add the uuid import to main.py while maintaining all architectural guidelines. This won't affect any of the models or engine capabilities since it's just adding a missing standard library import.

2. Here's the fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 856d7544-0a3f-480d-b891-52d3676cd28f
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

This fix:
1. Maintains all architectural guidelines
2. Doesn't modify any models
3. Keeps the engine capabilities intact
4. Simply adds the missing import needed for UUID generation
5. Should resolve the test failures while maintaining the original functionality

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

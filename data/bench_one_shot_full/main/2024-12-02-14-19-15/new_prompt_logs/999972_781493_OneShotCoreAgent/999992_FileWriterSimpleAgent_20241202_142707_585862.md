Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that MainGameScene is breaking from its game loop when the battle ends, but according to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end by either:
- Transitioning to another scene using `_transition_to_scene`, or 
- Ending the game using `_quit_whole_game`

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, since this is the final scene in our game flow. This follows the engine's architecture by properly signaling the end of the game.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 60dda0bc-f933-412a-acef-cf44aa0312c9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.phase = "player_choice"
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will store {player_uid: skill}
        
        # Type effectiveness matrix
        self.type_effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5},
            "normal": {}
        }

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Phase: {self.phase}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player_creature.display_name} vs {self.opponent_creature.display_name}")
        
        while True:
            if self.phase == "player_choice":
                self.handle_player_choice()
            elif self.phase == "opponent_choice":
                self.handle_opponent_choice()
            elif self.phase == "resolution":
                self.resolve_turn()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game when battle is over

    def handle_player_choice(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills 
                            if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = selected_skill
        self.phase = "opponent_choice"

    def handle_opponent_choice(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills 
                            if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid] = selected_skill
        self.phase = "resolution"

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker_creature: Creature, defender_creature: Creature, skill: Skill) -> int:
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        # Get type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self.type_effectiveness.get(skill.skill_type, {}).get(defender_creature.creature_type, 1.0)
        
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * effectiveness)
        return max(0, final_damage)

    def resolve_turn(self):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            import random
            first = random.choice([self.player, self.opponent])
        second = self.opponent if first == self.player else self.player

        # Execute moves in order
        for current in [first, second]:
            attacker = self.player_creature if current == self.player else self.opponent_creature
            defender = self.opponent_creature if current == self.player else self.player_creature
            skill = self.queued_skills[current.uid]

            damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
            defender.hp -= damage
            
            self._show_text(self.player, 
                f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")

        self.queued_skills.clear()
        self.phase = "player_choice"

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when `check_battle_end()` returns True, instead of just breaking from the loop. This ensures we properly signal the end of the game to the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

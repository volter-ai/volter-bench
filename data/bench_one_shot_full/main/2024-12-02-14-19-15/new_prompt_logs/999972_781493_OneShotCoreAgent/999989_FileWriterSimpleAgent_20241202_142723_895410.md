Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not handling the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception that gets raised when the game ends. Looking at the other test files and engine architecture:

- The engine is designed to raise `_QuitWholeGame` when a game ends gracefully
- We should catch this exception in our test, similar to how we handle `RandomModeGracefulExit`
- We should also patch `_quit_whole_game` like in the menu scene test to properly handle scene exits
- This maintains the engine's architecture while allowing us to test the battle scene properly

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 0c4a9a43-3faa-43a1-aed0-cdde21286e5a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Patch quit_whole_game to track if it was called
            with patch.object(AbstractApp, 'quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
                
                # Assert that either the game ended naturally or random mode expired
                assert mock_quit.called or HumanListener.random_mode_counter <= 0, \
                    "Scene did not end properly"
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added patch for quit_whole_game to track if it was called
3. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
4. Added assertion to verify the scene ended properly
5. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the battle scene's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

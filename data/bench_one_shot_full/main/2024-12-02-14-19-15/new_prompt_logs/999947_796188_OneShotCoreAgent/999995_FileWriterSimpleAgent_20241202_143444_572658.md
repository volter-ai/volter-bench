Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error is a simple NameError where `uuid` is not imported in main.py. The fix is straightforward - we just need to add the import statement for the uuid module at the top of main.py.

This is a basic Python import issue and doesn't affect our architecture or model guidelines. The models remain pure data schemas and all inheritance relationships are preserved.

2. Here's the complete fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 3ecdd621-a480-4454-b7f6-23122db42c1d
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

The only change was adding `import uuid` at the top of the file. This should resolve the NameError that was occurring when trying to generate UUIDs for the bot players.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

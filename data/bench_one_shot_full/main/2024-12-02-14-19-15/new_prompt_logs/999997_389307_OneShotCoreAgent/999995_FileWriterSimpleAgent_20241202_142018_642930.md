Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp back to max_hp directly in the scene initialization

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: ea642779-8f0a-4c1e-a5e7-8e6ab254cd15
```python main_game/models.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase

                break

    def _handle_player_turn(self) -> Skill:
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your move!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_bot_turn(self) -> Skill:

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        # Apply player skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        # Apply bot skill if still alive
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
            
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Moved the reset logic directly into MainGameScene's `__init__`
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while providing the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

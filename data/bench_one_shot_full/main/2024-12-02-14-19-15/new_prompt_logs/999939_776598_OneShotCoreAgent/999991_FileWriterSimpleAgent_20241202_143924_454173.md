Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the MainGameScene's battle resolution logic. Currently, when creatures have equal speed, we're not implementing the random order requirement specified in the docs:

> If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

The fix needs to be in main_game_scene.py, specifically in the resolve_turn method. We'll modify it to use random.random() to decide the order when speeds are equal. This doesn't require any model changes since it's purely scene logic.

2. Here's the complete fixed main_game_scene.py:

The key change is in the resolve_turn method where we now properly handle equal speeds with random order selection. This change maintains all architectural requirements while fixing the specific issue identified in QA.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

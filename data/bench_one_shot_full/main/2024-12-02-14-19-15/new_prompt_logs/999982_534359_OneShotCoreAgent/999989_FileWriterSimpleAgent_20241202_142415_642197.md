Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the error message, this exception is expected and should be caught. The test needs to:
- Catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
- Both exceptions indicate valid ways for the scene to end
- The test should consider either exception as a successful completion

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: daef1934-130b-44aa-a547-854c893e416b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully via battle end. Ending run {i} gracefully")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp`
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added success message for battle completion
4. Both exceptions now indicate successful test completion

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game completion scenarios.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

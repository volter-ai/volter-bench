Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how the MainMenuScene test handles scene transitions and quits.

We need to:
- Patch the _quit_whole_game method like we do in the menu scene test
- Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and the patched quit game exception
- Verify the game ended properly through one of these expected paths

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5e94697b-2b99-4f8d-85cf-0e097f26591e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class QuitGame(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_game(*args, **kwargs):
                raise QuitGame()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game', side_effect=exit_game) as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except QuitGame:
                    print(f"Game ended naturally through battle completion, ending run {i}")
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game ended but _quit_whole_game wasn't called"
                else:
                    assert False, "Scene ended without expected exit condition"

                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The changes:
1. Added a QuitGame exception class to catch when the game ends naturally
2. Patched _quit_whole_game to raise this exception instead of the engine's exception
3. Added proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and QuitGame
4. Added assertions to verify the game ended properly
5. Added proper cleanup between test iterations

This maintains the architecture and engine capabilities while properly testing that the MainGameScene ends correctly when a battle concludes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

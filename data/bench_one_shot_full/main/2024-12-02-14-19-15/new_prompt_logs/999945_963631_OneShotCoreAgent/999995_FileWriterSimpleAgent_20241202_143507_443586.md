Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods or properties. The reset functionality should be moved to the scenes.

The solution is to:
1. Remove all methods from models.py
2. Move the reset logic to MainGameScene where it's actually used
3. Keep models as pure data schemas with just fields
4. Handle all creature/player state management in the scene

2. Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 9aa64668-ad7d-4762-9781-74d47cfa1398
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The MainGameScene will need to handle resetting creature HP in its initialization. Here's the relevant part that needs to change in MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 0e95fd8a-1368-494f-b92d-6aeb8a434f40
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset both players' creatures HP
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
```

The rest of MainGameScene remains the same. This change keeps the models as pure data schemas while maintaining the same functionality by moving the logic to where it belongs - in the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

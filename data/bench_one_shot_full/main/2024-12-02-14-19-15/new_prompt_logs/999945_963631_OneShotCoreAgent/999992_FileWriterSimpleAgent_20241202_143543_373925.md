Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that MainGameScene cannot be imported, which suggests there's an issue with the class definition or imports in main_game_scene.py. Looking at the engine's lib.py, I notice that MainGameScene needs to properly inherit from AbstractGameScene and include the generic type parameter for the player type.

The solution is to:
1. Fix the MainGameScene class definition to properly inherit from AbstractGameScene[Player]
2. Ensure all imports are correct
3. Keep the scene logic but fix the class structure

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper type annotation for MainGameScene[Player]
2. Added type hints throughout the code
3. Fixed imports to include necessary types
4. Kept the scene logic intact while ensuring proper class structure

This should resolve the import error while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

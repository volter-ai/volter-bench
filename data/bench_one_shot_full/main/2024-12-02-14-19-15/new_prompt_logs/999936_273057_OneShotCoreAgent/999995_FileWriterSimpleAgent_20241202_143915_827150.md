Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's _execute_action method where it tries to reference undefined variables `player_action` and `bot_action`. The issue is in how we're trying to determine which player is the attacker.

The fix should:
- Remove references to undefined variables
- Pass the player/bot information along with the action
- Keep the scene logic clean and within engine capabilities

Instead of trying to compare actions to undefined variables, we should store the player reference with the action tuple when we create it. This way we can directly determine who is attacking.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added player reference to action tuples in _get_player_action
2. Modified _execute_action to use the player reference from the action tuple
3. Removed references to undefined variables
4. Kept all the game logic within scene methods
5. Maintained pure data models

This should resolve the NameError while keeping the game's functionality intact and following the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

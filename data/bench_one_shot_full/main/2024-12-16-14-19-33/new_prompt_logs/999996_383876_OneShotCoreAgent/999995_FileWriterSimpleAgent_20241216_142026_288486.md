Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. Instead, I should:

- Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
- Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene
- Add a simple assignment to set hp back to max_hp in the scene initialization
- Keep the models as pure data schemas with only attributes

2. Here's the fixed files:

# Excerpt ID: e5dca2ad-3363-4887-a784-1f978ad3fb34
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    damage: int
    category: str = "Skill"

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]
    category: str = "Creature"

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    category: str = "Player"
```

# Excerpt ID: 3835b3e2-11e6-471d-940f-86f480b5247a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills])

            # Resolve turns
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.thing.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.thing.damage

            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.thing.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.thing.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Moved the reset logic into MainGameScene's `__init__` 
3. Kept models as pure data schemas
4. Scene handles all the logic for managing creature state

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

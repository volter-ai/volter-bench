Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to use Player objects (which inherit from AbstractThing) as dictionary keys in `self.queued_skills`. The engine specifically prevents AbstractThing objects from being used as hashable keys, requiring us to use their prototype_ids instead.

The fix:
- Instead of storing the queued skills in a dictionary using Player objects as keys, we'll create a class-level structure to track the queued skills using player UIDs (which are strings and thus hashable)
- This maintains the pure data model approach while allowing us to properly track skills per player

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return participants[0], participants[1]

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the `queued_skills` dictionary that was using Player objects as keys
2. Added separate variables `player_queued_skill` and `opponent_queued_skill` to track skills
3. Modified the resolve_turn logic to use player UIDs to determine which queued skill to use
4. Kept all the game logic within the scene while maintaining pure data models

This solution avoids using AbstractThing objects as dictionary keys while maintaining the same functionality and staying within the engine's architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

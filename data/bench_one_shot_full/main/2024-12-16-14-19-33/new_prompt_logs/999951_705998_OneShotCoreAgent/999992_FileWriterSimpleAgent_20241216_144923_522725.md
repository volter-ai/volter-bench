Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that MainGameScene is terminating without properly transitioning or quitting. The issue is in the battle logic - when a creature's HP reaches 0, we're using `return` which breaks the scene's game loop improperly.

Solution:
- Remove the `return` statement in the battle resolution
- Keep the game loop running until a creature is defeated
- Use a flag to track battle state
- Properly transition to MainMenuScene using `_transition_to_scene` when battle ends
- Ensure the scene never exits its main loop without a proper transition

2. Here's the corrected MainGameScene:

    def _determine_order(self, first_pair, second_pair):

    def _calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
            
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `battle_active` flag to control the game loop
2. Removed the `return` statement that was causing improper scene termination
3. Moved the scene transition outside the skill execution loop
4. Ensured the scene always transitions properly when battle ends

This should fix both test failures by ensuring the scene always exits properly through `_transition_to_scene`.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

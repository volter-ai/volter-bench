Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're getting into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, which eventually leads to a QuitWholeGame exception that isn't properly caught in the test.

The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. We need to:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit AND AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
2. Add proper mocking of transitions to prevent infinite scene switching
3. Follow the pattern from test_main_menu_scene.py which properly handles scene transitions

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 49900af4-0feb-459c-8a33-0ccfdc82e2a5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods to catch all exit paths
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 or game quit, ending run {i} gracefully")
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned properly, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene did not exit properly"
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added TransitionFromScene exception to properly catch scene transitions
3. Patched both transition and quit methods to catch all possible exit paths
4. Added proper cleanup in finally block
5. Improved logging to better understand test execution flow

This follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py and properly handles all ways the scene might end, preventing the infinite loop while still testing the scene's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene - the battle isn't properly ending when all creatures are knocked out. Looking at the test output, we can see that when creatures run out of HP, the scene keeps going instead of transitioning back to the menu.

The problem is in the battle loop logic. When checking for knocked-out creatures, we're only checking during the damage resolution phase. We need to also check at the start of each turn if either player has any creatures left that can fight.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `_has_available_creatures` helper to check if a player has any creatures left
2. Added checks at the start of each turn to see if either player is out of creatures
3. Modified `_handle_turn_choice` to handle knocked out creatures and return None if no creatures are available
4. Removed redundant end-game checks from the damage resolution phase
5. Added proper battle end messages and scene transitions

This maintains the pure data model architecture while fixing the battle end conditions. The test should now pass as the scene will properly transition when either player runs out of creatures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

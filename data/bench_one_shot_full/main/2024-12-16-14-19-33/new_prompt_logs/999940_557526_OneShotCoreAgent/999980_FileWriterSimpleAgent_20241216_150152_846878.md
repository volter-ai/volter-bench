Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens in `_handle_turn` when the "Swap" option is selected but `_get_available_creatures` returns an empty list.

The fix should be:
1. Only show the "Swap" button if there are actually creatures available to swap to
2. This maintains the engine's pattern of never calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list
3. When there's only one choice (Attack), that's fine - the player must choose it

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are in `_handle_turn`:
1. We check for available creatures before building the choices list
2. We only add the "Swap" button if there are actually creatures available to swap to
3. This ensures we never call `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list
4. The rest of the logic remains the same, but is now safer since we know we'll always have valid choices

This maintains the engine's patterns and fixes the assertion error while keeping the game mechanics intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the battle scene isn't properly transitioning when it should end. Looking at the output, we can see that creatures are getting knocked out but the scene continues running until it hits the random move limit.

The issue is in the battle loop logic:
- We're showing "No other creatures available!" messages but not properly ending the battle
- The _handle_turn_choice is allowing turns to continue even when no valid moves are possible
- We need to check for battle end conditions more aggressively

The fix will:
- Move the battle end check to the start of each action phase
- Ensure we properly detect when a player has no valid moves
- Immediately end the battle when either player can't make a valid move
- Keep all game logic in the scene and not add any methods to models

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                    if self._check_battle_end():
                        return
```

Key changes:
1. Added dedicated _check_battle_end helper that handles all win conditions
2. Added battle end checks at multiple points:
   - Start of each turn
   - After each player's action selection
   - After each creature knockout
3. Ensured proper scene transitions in all end conditions
4. Maintained pure data models by keeping all logic in the scene
5. Fixed the issue where "No other creatures available!" wasn't ending the battle

This should now properly end battles and transition to the menu scene when either player runs out of valid moves or creatures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is a NameError because 'uuid' is not imported in main.py. This is a simple import issue. Looking at lib.py, we can see that uuid is already imported there, and we're using the make_uuid() function for generating UIDs.

The fix is straightforward:
- Instead of using uuid.uuid4() directly in main.py, we should use the make_uuid() function from lib.py
- This maintains consistency with the engine's utilities and follows the architecture better

2. Here's the fixed main.py:

# Excerpt ID: b22120e2-65d2-4ee9-a39d-f0614355a232
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, make_uuid
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = make_uuid()
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

This change:
1. Uses the engine's make_uuid() function instead of uuid.uuid4()
2. Maintains all the existing functionality
3. Stays within the engine's architecture
4. Doesn't modify any models or add any methods/properties to them

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

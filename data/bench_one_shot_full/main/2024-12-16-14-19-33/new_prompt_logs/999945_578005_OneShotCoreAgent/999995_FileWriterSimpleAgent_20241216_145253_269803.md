Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field but it's not being initialized properly. Looking at the error and architecture:

1. The fix approach:
- The active_creature field in Player needs to be marked as Optional since it starts as None and gets set later
- We need to import Optional from typing
- This matches the architecture since:
  - Models remain pure data schemas
  - We're just adjusting the type annotation
  - The actual setting of active_creature still happens in the scene logic
  - This follows the engine's capabilities since Optional is supported by the validation system

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 8450bcc5-b0ff-4d02-82f9-c931346c34e0
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The key change is marking active_creature as Optional[Creature] with a default value of None. This tells the validation system that it's okay for this field to be None initially.

This maintains the pure data schema nature of the models while fixing the validation error. The scene logic can still set active_creature when needed, but now the Player can be instantiated without it.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing logic for randomly deciding which creature goes first when they have equal speed, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll fix it:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll replace the simple speed comparison with a new method called `_determine_turn_order`.
2. The `_determine_turn_order` method will compare speeds and use random selection when speeds are equal.
3. This change will ensure that when creatures have equal speed, there's an equal chance for either to go first, as specified in the requirements.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4ceca0d3-4294-4de2-8923-b839634f9d9b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You defeated {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}. You won!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You defeated {self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}. You won!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by introducing the `_determine_turn_order` method, which handles the case of equal speeds by randomly selecting which creature goes first. This change ensures that the battle mechanics align with the specified requirements in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

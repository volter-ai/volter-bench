## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the discrepancy in the turn order handling when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of giving priority to the player's creature when speeds are equal, we'll implement a random decision. Here's how we'll do it:

   - We'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly select which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
   - We'll modify the condition in the `resolve_turn` method to include this random selection when speeds are equal.
   - This change will ensure that the turn order is decided randomly when creatures have the same speed, as specified in the architecture.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 49aecbf5-cbd7-406d-9e90-8efe13ca3300
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Randomly decide who goes first when speeds are equal
            creatures = [(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, k=2)

        self.execute_skill(*first, second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(*second, first[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This modification ensures that when the player's creature and the opponent's creature have the same speed, the turn order is decided randomly, as specified in the architecture. The `resolve_turn` method now uses `random.sample()` to randomly order the two creatures when their speeds are equal, addressing the discrepancy noted in the QA pass.

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.
2. We'll update the battle_round method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll modify the run method to use a while loop that continues until the battle ends, then transitions to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected pattern of always transitioning or quitting the game.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 273d67b2-1c54-41a5-9a35-5852d62dad82
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            battle_ended = self.battle_round()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self.player_turn()
        opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()

        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        if self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):
            return True

        if self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill):
            return True

        return False

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")
        
        if defender.hp == 0:
            winner = self.player if defender == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `run` method now uses a while loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends, it transitions back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.
3. The `battle_round` method now returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
4. The `execute_skill` method now checks if the defender's HP has reached 0 and returns True if the battle has ended.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes, addressing both issues mentioned in the test failures.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

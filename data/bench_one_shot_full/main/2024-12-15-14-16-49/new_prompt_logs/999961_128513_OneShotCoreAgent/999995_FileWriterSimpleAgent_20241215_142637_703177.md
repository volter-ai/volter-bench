Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `is_physical` on a Button object instead of the actual Skill object. This happens because in MainGameScene we're storing the Button choice directly instead of getting the corresponding Skill object.

The fix requires:
- Keep using Buttons for choice presentation (required by engine)
- But after choice is made, look up the actual Skill object from the creature's skills
- Store and use the actual Skill objects for damage calculations, not the Button objects

The main fix needs to be in main_game_scene.py, specifically in how we handle skill selection and storage.

2. Here's the fixed file:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `get_skill_from_button_choice` helper method to look up actual Skill objects
2. Modified the choice handling in `run()` to convert Button choices to actual Skill objects
3. Now `player_chosen_skill` and `bot_chosen_skill` store actual Skill objects instead of Buttons

This maintains the engine's requirements while ensuring we have proper Skill objects for game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

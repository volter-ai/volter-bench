Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in main_game_scene.py where we're trying to show creature swap choices but the available creatures list is empty. This happens when all creatures except the active one are knocked out. We need to handle this case by not offering the "Swap" option when there are no valid creatures to swap to.

The fix maintains the architecture by:
1. Keeping models as pure data schemas
2. Keeping game logic in scenes
3. Using proper engine capabilities for choices
4. Not modifying the engine itself

Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: 346a1d3a-aa69-4cf3-91f9-5f2fd74e35cf

        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures to starting state
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

```

The key changes are:
1. Check for available creatures before showing the "Swap" option
2. Only show "Swap" button if there are creatures to swap to
3. Added more feedback messages for forced swaps
4. Updated scene string to indicate swap availability

This ensures we never try to show an empty list of choices while maintaining the game's architecture and functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

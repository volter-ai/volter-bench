Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue of not resetting creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.

The fix needs to:
1. Reset HP to max_hp for all creatures when leaving battle
2. Keep models as pure data schemas
3. Handle this in the scene logic, not in models

Since we can't add methods to models, we'll handle this in the MainGameScene before transitioning back to the menu. Here's the fixed scene file:

# Excerpt ID: 8c893b5b-06a4-4d44-b18a-90766000d71e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

        else:
            return random.sample([p1_data, p2_data], 2)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
            
        # Type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self._get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def _get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},

            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }

        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, 
            f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender,
            f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added a new `_reset_creature_states` method that resets HP to max_hp for all creatures
2. Called this method before transitioning back to the menu scene
3. Kept all models as pure data schemas by handling the reset in scene logic
4. Reset both player and opponent creatures to maintain consistency

This fix ensures that creatures are restored to full health when leaving battle, while maintaining the architectural constraints of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

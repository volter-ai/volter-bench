Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_actions`. The error message tells us we should use `prototype_id` instead of the object itself. This is happening because AbstractThing objects are intentionally not hashable to prevent their direct use as dictionary keys.

The fix:
Instead of using Player objects as keys in the queued_actions dictionary, we should use their `uid` property. The `uid` is a string that uniquely identifies each player instance, making it a perfect choice for a dictionary key. This follows the engine's design principles while maintaining the functionality we need.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

        self._execute_skill(first, second)

           second == self.opponent and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender):
        skill = self.queued_actions[attacker.uid]
        attacker_creature = self.player_creature if attacker == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        defender_creature = self.player_creature if defender == self.player else self.opponent_creature

        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp -= max(0, damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
            f"Dealt {damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")
```

The only changes made were to use `player.uid` and `opponent.uid` as dictionary keys instead of the Player objects themselves. This follows the engine's design principles while maintaining all the functionality. The rest of the implementation remains unchanged.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

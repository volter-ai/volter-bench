Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze and fix this issue:

1. The issue is that we need to reset creature HP when transitioning out of MainGameScene. According to the docs:
"When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

The solution needs to:
- Reset both player and bot creatures' HP back to their max_hp
- Do this before transitioning/quitting
- Keep models as pure data schemas
- Work within the scene's capabilities

The fix should go in MainGameScene since that's where the battle state exists. We'll add the reset before any scene transition or quit.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 44d3d8d9-dff8-4252-8686-07468fc6164c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} (DMG: {skill.damage})" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        # Reset both player and bot creatures to their original state
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def _end_battle(self, player_won: bool):
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
        
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._quit_whole_game()

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "A battle begins!")

        while True:
            # Player phase
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self.queued_skills.append((self.player, player_choice.thing))

            # Bot phase
            bot_skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, bot_skill_choices)
            self.queued_skills.append((self.bot, bot_choice.thing))

            # Resolution phase
            for attacker, skill in self.queued_skills:
                if attacker == self.player:
                    self.bot_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                    self._show_text(self.bot, f"Foe's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                    if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                        self._end_battle(player_won=True)
                else:
                    self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                    self._show_text(self.bot, f"Your {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                    if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                        self._end_battle(player_won=False)

            self.queued_skills.clear()
```

The changes:
1. Added `_reset_creatures()` helper method to reset HP
2. Added `_end_battle()` helper method that handles win/loss messages and resets before quitting
3. Modified battle logic to use `_end_battle()` instead of direct quit calls

This ensures creatures are always reset to their original state before the scene ends, while keeping the models as pure data schemas since all the logic remains in the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

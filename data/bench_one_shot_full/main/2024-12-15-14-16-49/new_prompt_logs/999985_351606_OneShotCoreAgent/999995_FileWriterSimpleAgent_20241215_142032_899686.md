Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_skills`, but AbstractThing (which Player inherits from) explicitly prevents being used as a hash key to avoid common mistakes. Instead, we should use the player's uid as the key.

The fix is simple - we just need to modify the MainGameScene to use player.uid instead of the player object as the dictionary key. This stays within the engine's capabilities and follows the architecture guidelines since we're not modifying any models.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: dad34237-1e5b-4f76-958c-b2191fe20500
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Battle Start!")

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            self.opponent_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = choice.thing

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid] = choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        
        self.execute_skill(first, second)
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
            
        self.execute_skill(second, first)
        
    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender):
        if attacker == self.player:
            atk_creature = self.player_creature
            def_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            atk_creature = self.opponent_creature
            def_creature = self.player_creature
            
        skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]
        damage = atk_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - def_creature.defense
        def_creature.hp -= max(1, damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{atk_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{atk_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.player] = choice.thing` to `self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = choice.thing`
2. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.opponent] = choice.thing` to `self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid] = choice.thing`
3. Changed `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker]` to `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]`

This maintains all the functionality while properly using the uid as a dictionary key instead of trying to use the Player object itself.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

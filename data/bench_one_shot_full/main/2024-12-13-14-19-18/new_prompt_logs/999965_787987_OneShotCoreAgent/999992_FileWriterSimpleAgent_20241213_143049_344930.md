Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because scene transitions are creating an infinite loop between MainGameScene and MainMenuScene, eventually leading to an uncaught _QuitWholeGame exception.

The test needs to properly catch the _QuitWholeGame exception, and we should also patch the transition methods in the test to prevent the infinite loop, similar to how the MainMenuScene test works.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7267b1f1-e187-40c7-935a-c3fe3ecbd552
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods to catch scene exits
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition, ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:

1. Added patching of both transition and quit methods to prevent infinite scene transitions
2. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Used TransitionFromScene exception to detect when the scene properly exits
4. Added proper cleanup in the finally block

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the MainGameScene in isolation. The test now properly handles all ways the scene might exit:
- Via transition to another scene
- Via random mode counter reaching zero
- Via game quit
- Via unexpected error (which would fail the test)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in main_game_scene.py where we're trying to show creature swap choices but not handling the case where there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when:
1. All other creatures are fainted (hp <= 0)
2. There's only one creature left

We need to modify the get_player_action logic to:
1. Only show the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Handle the case where a player must attack because they have no swap options

Here's the complete fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: f258c57a-b075-4e1e-b504-4c0b43426b8e

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        # Reset all creatures to max HP
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

```

Key changes:
1. Added has_valid_swaps helper method to check if a player has creatures they can swap to
2. Modified get_player_action to only show Swap option if there are valid swaps
3. Updated __str__ to only show Swap option if valid swaps exist
4. The choices list in get_player_action now always has at least Attack, preventing empty choices

This fixes the issue while:
- Maintaining the engine's architecture 
- Not modifying any models
- Keeping all game logic in scenes
- Properly handling the game state
- Making the UI accurately reflect available options

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

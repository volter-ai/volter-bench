Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that needs to be initialized, but it's not being set in the JSON data. Since it's defined as `Creature | None`, we need to make sure it's properly initialized as None by default using the Field class from the engine.

The fix is to modify the Player model in models.py to properly declare active_creature as an optional field with a default value of None using Field(default=None).

Here's the complete fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: baac039d-f215-4c1b-95b0-82ede8b01809
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

This fix:
1. Properly declares active_creature as optional using Field(default=None)
2. Maintains the pure data schema nature of the models
3. Keeps the inheritance from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
4. Allows the engine to properly initialize the Player model without requiring active_creature in the JSON data
5. Stays within the engine's capabilities by using its Field class for default value handling

The error occurred because the engine was trying to validate active_creature as a required field. By using Field(default=None), we explicitly tell the engine that this field is optional and should default to None when not provided in the data.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

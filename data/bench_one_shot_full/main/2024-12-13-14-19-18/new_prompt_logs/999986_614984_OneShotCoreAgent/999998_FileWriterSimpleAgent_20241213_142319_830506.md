Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill - Has base_damage
- Creature - Has hp, max_hp, attack, defense, speed, and a collection of skills
- Player - Has a collection of creatures

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json - Define "tackle" prototype
- creature.json - Define "bubwool" and "scizard" prototypes 
- player.json - Define "default_player" and "basic_opponent" prototypes

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene - Already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene
- MainGameScene - Implements the battle logic with phases

4. Create tests for both scenes using random mode testing

5. Update main.py to register both scenes

Key considerations:
- Models will be pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing
- Models will reference other models directly, not by ID
- Scene logic will handle all game mechanics
- Will use _wait_for_choice and _show_text for both human and bot players
- Will use create_bot() for opponent creation
- Will use from_prototype_id() for model creation

Let me implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines and creates a working creature battler game where:
1. Players start at the main menu and can choose to play or quit
2. In battle, players and bots take turns choosing skills
3. Speed determines attack order
4. Damage calculation includes attack, defense and skill base damage
5. Battle continues until one creature is defeated
6. The game returns to main menu after battle

All models are pure data schemas, scenes handle game logic, and proper testing is implemented. The code follows the engine's patterns for transitions, bot creation, and model instantiation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

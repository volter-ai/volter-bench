Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that is required but not being initialized. Looking at the error and architecture:

1. The error occurs when creating a Player from the prototype data
2. The `active_creature` field needs to be initialized but should be optional since it starts as None
3. We need to fix this in models.py by making `active_creature` properly optional using the Field type from the engine

The solution is to:
1. Keep `active_creature` as an optional Creature type
2. Use Field with default=None to make it properly optional in the model schema
3. This matches the architecture where models are pure data schemas
4. The actual setting of active_creature happens in the game logic

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: cf31ea1f-bfbf-4cbf-ac05-23ffe564a5cc
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

The key change is using `Field(default=None)` for active_creature to properly mark it as optional in the model schema. This allows the Player to be created without an active_creature initially, while still maintaining type safety and the pure data schema approach.

This fixes the validation error while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When a battle ends and _quit_whole_game() is called, we need to catch this expected exception in our test, similar to how we handle RandomModeGracefulExit.

The fix is simple - we need to update the test_main_game_scene.py file to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in addition to RandomModeGracefulExit. This is the expected behavior when a battle ends.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 1476a778-68a3-4c9d-acee-bf49dc95b019
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle ended naturally. Ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Adds a new except clause to catch the game ending naturally
3. Maintains all existing functionality
4. Follows the engine's design where _QuitWholeGame is the expected way to end a game
5. Keeps all models and architecture intact since this is just a test fix

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can end:
- When the random mode counter reaches zero
- When a battle naturally concludes with a winner/loser

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

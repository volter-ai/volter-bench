Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with an empty list of choices. This happens in `get_player_action` when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to. Looking at the test output, this occurs after creatures are knocked out.

The fix needs to:
1. Ensure we never call `_wait_for_choice` with empty choices
2. Handle the case when a player has no valid swap options by forcing them to use "Attack" only
3. Stay within the engine's capabilities by only using the provided methods

The solution is to modify `main_game_scene.py` to:
- Check if there are available creatures before showing the "Swap" option
- Only show "Attack" if no swaps are available
- Keep all game logic in the scene
- Keep using the engine's choice system

Here's the fixed implementation:

```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method where we now:
1. Check for available creatures before building the choice list
2. Only include "Swap" if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Always include "Attack" as an option
4. Keep the same flow but with guaranteed non-empty choice lists

This maintains the architecture while fixing the empty choices issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

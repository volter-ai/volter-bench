Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error is a simple missing import of `uuid` in main.py. We need to import it from the standard library. Since we're already using `make_uuid()` from the engine lib.py, we should use that instead of uuid directly to stay consistent with the engine's capabilities.

2. Here's the fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: d407238d-5a45-4eef-8591-e10612ab9704
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, make_uuid
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = make_uuid()
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed direct uuid import
2. Added make_uuid from engine lib
3. Changed uuid.uuid4() to make_uuid()

This maintains consistency with the engine's capabilities while fixing the NameError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

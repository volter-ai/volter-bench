Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead, the reset logic should be moved to the MainGameScene. We'll:
- Remove the reset() method from Creature model
- Add a _reset_creature() helper method in MainGameScene that sets hp back to max_hp
- Call this scene method instead of the model method

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: 9cd730e4-d779-4f58-addf-e04a9a6eacc0
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"

    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int

    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start
        self._reset_creature(self.player_creature)
        self._reset_creature(self.bot_creature)

    def _reset_creature(self, creature):
        """Helper method to reset a creature's HP to max"""
        creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot choice phase
            bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
                
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
        
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing
```

The key changes:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model to keep it as a pure data schema
2. Added _reset_creature() helper method in MainGameScene
3. Updated initialization to use the scene method instead of the model method

This maintains proper separation between data models and game logic while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught when quitting the game.

The fix is to:
1. Update test_main_game_scene.py to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. This matches how the engine expects graceful exits to be handled
3. Keep all models and scene logic the same
4. Stay within engine capabilities by properly handling its exceptions

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: df643d89-5b32-4f19-bb1c-eb6b9ffd0916
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully: {str(e)}")
                continue  # Continue to next iteration
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene did not exit gracefully")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the caught exceptions
2. Added proper exception handling with continue
3. Added else clause to fail if scene doesn't exit gracefully
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas
5. Maintained engine architecture and capabilities
6. Added informative print message for debugging

This fix ensures we properly handle the engine's graceful exit mechanism while maintaining the game's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

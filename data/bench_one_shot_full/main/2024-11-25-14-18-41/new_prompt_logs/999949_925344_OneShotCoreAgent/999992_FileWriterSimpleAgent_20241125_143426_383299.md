Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_skills`. The error message tells us to use prototype_id instead of the object itself.

The fix is to:
1. Change the queued_skills dictionary to use player.uid instead of the player object as the key
2. This is the correct approach because:
   - We can't use prototype_id since multiple players could have the same prototype
   - uid is unique per player instance
   - We're not using the Player object directly as a key
   - This maintains the models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 4635c5d6-1d25-43b9-bfbf-fe4b963a05c8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.phase = "player_choice"
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed queued_skills to use player.uid as key instead of player object
2. Updated all references to queued_skills to use player.uid
3. Kept all other logic the same
4. Maintained models as pure data schemas
5. Fixed the hashable error while staying within engine capabilities

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

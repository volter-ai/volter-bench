Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Fix Description:
The issue is in the MainGameScene's resolve_turn method where it doesn't handle speed ties randomly as specified in the documentation. Currently, it just checks if player's speed > bot's speed, but according to the docs:

"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The fix is simple:
- When speeds are equal, use random.choice() to decide who goes first
- Keep all other logic the same
- No model changes needed since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key change is in the resolve_turn method where I added proper handling of speed ties using random.choice(). This maintains all the architectural requirements while fixing the specific issue identified in QA.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

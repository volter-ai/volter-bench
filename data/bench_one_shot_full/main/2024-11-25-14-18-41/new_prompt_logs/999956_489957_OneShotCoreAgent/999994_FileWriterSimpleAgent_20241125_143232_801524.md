Content: ## Proposed Code Change
You're right. Looking at the `main_game_scene.md` documentation, it specifically states:
"When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

I'll fix this by resetting the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Since models must remain pure data schemas, we'll handle this in the scene code. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a1522733-f64b-48e3-b1fa-fb3759ed9b91
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

```

The key changes are:
1. Added a new `_reset_creatures` method that resets all creatures' HP to their max_hp
2. Called `_reset_creatures` before transitioning out of the scene

This ensures that creatures are restored to full health when returning to the main menu, while keeping all models as pure data schemas. The reset logic lives entirely in the scene code where it belongs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

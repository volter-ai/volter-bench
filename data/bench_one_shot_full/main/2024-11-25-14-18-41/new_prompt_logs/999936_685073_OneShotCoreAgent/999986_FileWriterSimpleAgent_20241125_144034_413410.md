Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the MainGameScene test. When the battle ends and transitions to MainMenuScene, which then quits, we need to catch this expected exception in our test.

The fix should:
- Modify test_main_game_scene.py to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception
- Keep all game logic intact
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Maintain test coverage

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: bf9891d4-39d2-4223-916b-5ede9dd9e128
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    GracefulExit, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully after battle in run {i}")
            else:
                print(f"Battle completed normally in run {i}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame in the test loop
3. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging
4. Maintained all existing test functionality

This should fix the test failures while:
- Keeping the game logic intact
- Staying within engine capabilities
- Maintaining proper test coverage
- Not modifying any models or scene logic

The fix only changes how we handle the expected quit behavior in the test, which is the correct approach since the game itself is working as intended.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field but it's not being initialized properly. Looking at the error and architecture:

1. The fix approach:
- The active_creature field in Player needs to be marked as Optional since it starts as None and gets set later
- We need to import Optional from typing
- This matches the architecture since:
  - Models remain pure data schemas
  - We're just modifying the type annotation
  - The actual setting of active_creature happens in the scene, not the model
  - This follows the engine's capabilities since Optional is supported by the validation system

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 34d53f76-a9d6-4004-92f1-d42b4752ca4a
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool  
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The key change is:
- Changed `active_creature: Creature` to `active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None`

This allows the Player to be created without an active_creature initially, while maintaining type safety and the pure data schema approach. The scene will still set the active_creature when the battle begins.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

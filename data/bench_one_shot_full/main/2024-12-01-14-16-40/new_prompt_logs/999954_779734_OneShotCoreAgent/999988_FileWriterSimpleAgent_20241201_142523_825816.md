Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue has two parts that need fixing in MainGameScene:

a) Speed tie handling:
- When creatures have equal speed, we need to randomly choose who goes first
- We'll modify _resolve_turn to handle this case using random.choice

b) Creature state reset:
- After battle ends, we need to reset creature HP to max_hp
- We'll add a _reset_creatures method to restore state
- We'll call this before quitting the game
- Since models are pure data schemas, we can directly modify the hp attribute

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added random resolution for speed ties in _resolve_turn
2. Added _reset_creatures method to restore creature HP
3. Called _reset_creatures before quitting game
4. Maintained pure data schema approach by directly modifying hp attribute

The implementation now fully matches the architecture requirements while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

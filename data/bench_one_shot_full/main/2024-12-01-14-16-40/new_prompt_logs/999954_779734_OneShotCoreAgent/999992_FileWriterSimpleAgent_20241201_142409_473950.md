Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When the battle ends and _quit_whole_game() is called, we need to catch this expected exception in our test, similar to how we handle RandomModeGracefulExit.

The fix is to update the test file to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception, which is the expected way for a game to end. This matches the engine's design where games must end either through a transition or through quitting.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 3c453b2c-74ba-4d31-80c5-5c8df73fc8d4
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed normally in run {i}")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene did not end properly via RandomModeGracefulExit or _QuitWholeGame")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added else clause to fail the test if neither expected exception is raised
4. Updated success message to be more specific about how the game ended

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing that the game scene ends correctly either through random mode timeout or through normal game completion.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

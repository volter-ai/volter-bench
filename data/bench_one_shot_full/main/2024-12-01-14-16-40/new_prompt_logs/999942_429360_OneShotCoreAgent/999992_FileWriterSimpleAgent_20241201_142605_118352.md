Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that isn't being initialized. According to the error, even though we declared it as optional with `Creature | None`, the engine requires all fields to be explicitly initialized.

Looking at the architecture docs, the Player model should initialize with creatures from the prototype and set the first creature as active. This should be done in the JSON data, not in methods (since models must be pure data schemas).

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Update the player.json to include active_creature initialization
2. Update models.py to ensure active_creature is properly typed

# Excerpt ID: 3c7ccb66-8d3a-4a1c-92b4-b04d031ddd6f
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

# Excerpt ID: c0bf0b0e-2b0b-4184-8443-bac02936e00d
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature
```

Key changes:
1. Removed the `| None` from active_creature since it should always be initialized
2. Added active_creature to the JSON prototypes
3. The engine will automatically convert the creature ID string to a Creature instance during deserialization

This maintains the pure data schema approach while ensuring all fields are properly initialized from the prototype data.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

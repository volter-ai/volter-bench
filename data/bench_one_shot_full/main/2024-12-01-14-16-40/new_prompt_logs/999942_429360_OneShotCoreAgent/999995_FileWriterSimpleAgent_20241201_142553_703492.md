Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that main.py is trying to import MainGameScene but we haven't created that file yet. We need to remove that import and scene registration until we implement it.

Let's fix main.py by removing the MainGameScene reference for now. We'll add it back once we implement that scene.

# Excerpt ID: bae8c482-1202-487d-a307-9d78c41eb3d4
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        # We'll add MainGameScene registration later when we implement it

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This change will allow the tests to run without the ModuleNotFoundError. We'll need to:

1. First get the basic MainMenuScene working and tested
2. Then implement MainGameScene in a separate PR
3. Finally update main.py to include MainGameScene

This follows a better incremental development approach and keeps the code working at each step.

Would you like me to continue with implementing MainGameScene next?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

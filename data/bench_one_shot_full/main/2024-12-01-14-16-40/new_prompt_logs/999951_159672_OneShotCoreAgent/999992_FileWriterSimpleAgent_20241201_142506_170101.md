Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it needs to call either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()` when the battle ends, rather than just breaking from the loop.

Looking at the error:
1. The scene terminates without transitioning or quitting
2. This happens after showing "You lost!" or "You won!"
3. We should transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends

I'll fix the MainGameScene by:
1. Adding a proper scene exit after battle end
2. Ensuring we call `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after showing the battle result
3. Keeping the battle loop running until we explicitly transition or quit

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

The key changes are:
1. Added proper scene transition after battle end
2. Reset creature HP before transitioning back to menu
3. Ensured the scene always exits through proper transition

This maintains the engine's architecture by:
- Using proper scene transitions
- Keeping all game logic in scenes
- Not modifying any models
- Using the engine's built-in methods for scene flow

The scene will now properly transition back to the main menu after a battle ends, fixing both test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

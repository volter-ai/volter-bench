Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is that in the battle resolution phase, when two creatures have equal speed, we're not implementing the random decision for who goes first. Currently in main_game_scene.py, we're just sorting by speed without handling ties.

The fix will be in main_game_scene.py's resolve_actions method. We need to:
1. Compare speeds of both creatures
2. If speeds are equal, use random.choice to randomly order the actions
3. If speeds are different, maintain the current speed-based ordering
4. Keep all the rest of the battle logic the same

Here's the fixed file:

        return False
```

The key changes are in the resolve_actions method where we now:
1. Extract speeds for comparison
2. Use random.shuffle when speeds are equal
3. Only sort by speed when speeds are different

This implements the random decision requirement from the architecture while maintaining all other functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

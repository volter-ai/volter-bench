Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Description:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the documentation. According to the docs, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should also have a "Back" option to return to the previous menu.

To implement this, I will:
1. Add a "Back" button in both the skill selection and creature swap menus
2. Use a nested loop structure in get_player_action() to allow returning to the main menu
3. Keep the same model structure since this is purely a scene logic change

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

```

Key changes:
1. Added a while loop in get_player_action() to handle the main menu
2. Added "Back" button to both Attack and Swap submenus
3. Used continue to return to main menu when Back is selected
4. Improved handling of the case where no swap targets are available
5. Maintained all existing battle mechanics while adding the Back functionality

This implementation now matches the documentation's requirement for a "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase while maintaining all other functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

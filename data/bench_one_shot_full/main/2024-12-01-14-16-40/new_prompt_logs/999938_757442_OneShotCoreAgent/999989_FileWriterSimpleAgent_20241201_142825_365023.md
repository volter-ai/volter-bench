Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught when the game ends gracefully. Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly handles both TransitionFromScene and RandomModeGracefulExit, but test_main_game_scene.py needs to also handle _QuitWholeGame.

The solution is to:
1. Update test_main_game_scene.py to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Add proper logging when the game ends due to win/loss
3. Keep the test running through all 10 iterations even if a game ends

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 0ff7f5b6-4f7b-4369-be16-96fa67adc0a5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended naturally through win/loss condition. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            
            # Reset for next iteration
            app.terminated = False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added reset of app.terminated flag between iterations
4. Added proper logging for game end conditions

This allows the test to properly handle both cases where:
- The game ends naturally through win/loss (_QuitWholeGame)
- The random mode counter expires (RandomModeGracefulExit)

The test will now run all 10 iterations regardless of how each individual game ends, providing better test coverage of the battle system.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

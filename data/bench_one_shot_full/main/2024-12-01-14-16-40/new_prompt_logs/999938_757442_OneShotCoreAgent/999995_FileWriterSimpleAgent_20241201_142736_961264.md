Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win/loss), we're just returning from the run() method instead of explicitly calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always explicitly end via one of these methods. We need to modify MainGameScene to properly end the game when a battle concludes by calling `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the win/loss message.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 35d3da87-f49c-4dd7-87ff-48ceea540f12

    def check_battle_end(self):

            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")

        elif not bot_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now properly end the game by calling `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, rather than just returning. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit rather than just returning.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue of not resetting creature states after battle.

The solution:
1. In MainGameScene, before transitioning back to MainMenuScene, we need to reset the HP of both player's and bot's creatures back to their max_hp
2. Since models must be pure data schemas, we'll do this in the scene code, not as a method on the models
3. We'll do this right before the scene transition

Only the MainGameScene needs to be modified. Here's the complete fixed file:

        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Added `_reset_creature_states()` method to handle resetting creature HP
2. Called this method before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
3. The reset logic is kept in the scene code, maintaining pure data models
4. Reset is applied to all creatures for both player and bot

This change ensures that creatures are restored to full health after each battle, as specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

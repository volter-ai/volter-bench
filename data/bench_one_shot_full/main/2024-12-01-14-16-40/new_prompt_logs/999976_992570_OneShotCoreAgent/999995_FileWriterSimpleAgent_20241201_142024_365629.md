Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the `_QuitWholeGame` exception is not being caught in the test. When the battle ends and `_quit_whole_game()` is called, we need to catch this exception in the test, similar to how we catch `RandomModeGracefulExit`.

The test should expect either:
- RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves reach 0)
- _QuitWholeGame (when battle ends naturally)

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 84c86d7e-9ab4-4cee-a8f4-e823e69180ec
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle ended naturally. Ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Adds exception handling for _QuitWholeGame
3. Maintains all existing functionality
4. Stays within engine capabilities
5. Doesn't modify any models or core game logic

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the scene can end - either through random mode timeout or through natural battle conclusion.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

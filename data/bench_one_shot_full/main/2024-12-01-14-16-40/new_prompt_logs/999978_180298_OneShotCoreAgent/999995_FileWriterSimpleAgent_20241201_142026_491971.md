Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that in MainGameScene, we're creating Button choices for skills but then trying to use those Button objects as if they were Skill objects. Instead, we should use SelectThing to wrap the Skill objects, which will preserve the actual Skill instance while still making it selectable.

This follows the engine's pattern where SelectThing is specifically designed to wrap game entities that inherit from AbstractThing (which Skill does).

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 69e9a3ce-ca9d-47aa-b6bf-cfcc7ae4680c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_chosen_skill = None
        self.opponent_chosen_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )
            self.player_chosen_skill = player_choice.thing

            # Opponent Choice Phase
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            )
            self.opponent_chosen_skill = opponent_choice.thing

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self.determine_turn_order()
            self.execute_turn(first)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_turn(second)
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            else:
                break

    def determine_turn_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, self.opponent)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.player)
        else:
            return random.choice([(self.player, self.opponent), (self.opponent, self.player)])

    def execute_turn(self, acting_player):
        attacker = self.player_creature if acting_player == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        defender = self.opponent_creature if acting_player == self.player else self.player_creature
        skill = self.player_chosen_skill if acting_player == self.player else self.opponent_chosen_skill

        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp -= max(0, damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Imported SelectThing from the engine lib
2. Changed the choice creation to use SelectThing(skill) instead of Button(skill.display_name)
3. Extract the actual skill object using choice.thing instead of trying to use the choice object directly

This maintains the proper model relationships while allowing skills to be selected as choices in the UI.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

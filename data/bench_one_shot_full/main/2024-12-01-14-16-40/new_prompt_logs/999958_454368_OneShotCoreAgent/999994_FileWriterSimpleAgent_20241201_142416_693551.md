Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the MainGameScene's resolution phase where speed ties aren't being handled randomly as specified in the architecture. Currently, when creatures have equal speed, the player always goes first by default.

To fix this, I'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method in MainGameScene to:
1. Check if speeds are equal
2. If equal, use random.choice to randomly select who goes first
3. If not equal, use the existing speed comparison logic

This change only requires modifying the MainGameScene class and doesn't impact the models or other components. The fix stays within the engine's capabilities since we can use Python's random module.

2. Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene file:

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

The key change is in the `_resolve_turn` method, where I've added explicit handling of speed ties using `random.choice([True, False])` to give each creature an equal chance of going first when their speeds are equal. This brings the implementation in line with the architecture documentation's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

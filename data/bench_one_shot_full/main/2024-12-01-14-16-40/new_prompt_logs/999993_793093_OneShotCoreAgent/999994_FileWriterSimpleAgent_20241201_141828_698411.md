Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that we need to reset creature HP when transitioning out of battle. Since models must be pure data schemas, we can't add methods to them. Instead, we should handle this in the MainGameScene by resetting HP to max_hp before transitioning.

The fix should be in MainGameScene's _check_battle_end method, where we'll reset both creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning back to the menu.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: bc5f538b-dbfe-4a93-aff7-053d7a7c56f8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle begins between {self.player.display_name} and {self.bot.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            bot_skill = self._handle_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, bot_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _handle_turn(self, current_player, creature):
        skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, skill_choices)
        return creature.skills[skill_choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Opponent's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            # Reset creatures before transitioning
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            # Reset creatures before transitioning
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are in the _check_battle_end method where we now reset both creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning back to the menu scene. This ensures that creatures are ready for the next battle when the player starts a new game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll describe how to fix the MainGameScene to fully implement the architecture requirements:

1. Add "Back" button to choice phases
2. Implement proper action queueing for both players
3. Add complete turn resolution with:
   - Speed-based execution order
   - Swap priority
   - Proper damage calculation with:
     - Physical vs Special formulas
     - Type effectiveness multipliers
4. Add forced swapping when creatures are knocked out
5. Implement proper battle end conditions

Here's the complete fixed implementation:

```

This implementation now fully matches the architecture requirements:
1. Proper choice phases with Back button
2. Complete action queueing system using the Action class
3. Full turn resolution with:
   - Swap priority
   - Speed-based execution order
   - Physical vs Special damage formulas
   - Type effectiveness system
4. Proper forced swapping when creatures are knocked out
5. Complete battle end conditions

The code stays within the engine's capabilities by:
1. Using the engine's choice system (Button, SelectThing)
2. Using _show_text for all game messages
3. Keeping models as pure data schemas
4. Using proper scene transitions
5. Maintaining proper bot support

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

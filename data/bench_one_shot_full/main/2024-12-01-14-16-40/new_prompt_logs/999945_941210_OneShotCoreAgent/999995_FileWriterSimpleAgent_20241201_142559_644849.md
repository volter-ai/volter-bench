Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that needs to be initialized, but it's not being set in the JSON data. Since this is a required field according to the model (not marked as optional), the validation is failing.

The solution is to:
1. Add `active_creature` to the player JSON data, setting it to the first creature in their list
2. Keep the model as a pure data schema
3. Stay within the engine's capabilities by using the prototype system

Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 29ffb4b7-4f00-4515-9d1b-bf3d806df0b9
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

# Excerpt ID: 3db4909f-ff30-490d-a87f-670c87d3a0f7
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature
```

This solution:
1. Keeps models as pure data schemas
2. Uses the prototype system to properly initialize all required fields
3. Maintains proper typing and validation
4. Follows the engine's pattern of using prototype IDs in JSON that get converted to actual objects
5. Removes the `| None` from active_creature since it should always have a value according to the game design

The error was happening because we had `active_creature: Creature | None` but weren't providing a value in the JSON. Now we're explicitly setting it in the JSON data and making it a required field in the model.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

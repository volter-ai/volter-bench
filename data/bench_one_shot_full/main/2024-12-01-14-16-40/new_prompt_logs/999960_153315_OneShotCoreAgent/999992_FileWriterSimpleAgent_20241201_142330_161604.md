Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py which passes, we can see that it properly handles both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions. We need to do the same in test_main_game_scene.py.

The solution is to:
1. Add exception handling for _QuitWholeGame in the test
2. Add a print statement to show how the scene ended (for debugging)
3. Follow the same pattern as the main menu scene test

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 8de99aa9-bd90-4a31-9a44-e25a10e583e4
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0, ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added debug print statement when game quits

This matches the engine's expected behavior where _QuitWholeGame is a normal way to end the game and should be caught in tests. The test will now pass while still verifying that the game scene runs correctly through multiple iterations.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing implementation for random order when creatures have the same speed during the resolution phase, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use a custom sorting key that includes a random factor when creatures have the same speed.

2. We'll implement a new method `_get_action_priority` that returns a tuple with the action type priority, creature speed, and a random number for tie-breaking.

3. We'll use this new method as the key for sorting the turn queue.

Here's the proposed solution:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_queue = []

```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing a random order when creatures have the same speed during the resolution phase. The key changes are:

1. We added a new method `_get_action_priority` that returns a tuple with three elements:
   - Action type priority (swap actions always go first)
   - Creature speed (for attack actions)
   - A random number for tie-breaking

2. We modified the `_resolution_phase` method to use `_get_action_priority` as the sorting key for the turn queue.

These changes ensure that when creatures have the same speed, the order will be randomized, as specified in the architecture documentation. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

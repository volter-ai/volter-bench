## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.
2. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.

Here's how we'll implement these changes:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state` that will be called when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This method will reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.

2. We'll modify the `player_turn` method to include a 'Back' option when choosing between 'Attack' and 'Swap'. This will allow the player to go back to the main choice if they change their mind.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 478a64f6-aa9e-47f5-bae7-17c2b05dedf9

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `reset_creatures_state` method is now called in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that all creatures' HP is reset to their max_hp when leaving the battle scene.

2. A 'Back' option has been added to the Player Choice Phase. In the `player_turn` method, there's now a 'Back' button available when choosing between 'Attack' and 'Swap'. Additionally, when choosing a skill or a creature to swap to, there's also a 'Back' option that allows the player to return to the main choice.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The changes are consistent with the models and architecture described earlier.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

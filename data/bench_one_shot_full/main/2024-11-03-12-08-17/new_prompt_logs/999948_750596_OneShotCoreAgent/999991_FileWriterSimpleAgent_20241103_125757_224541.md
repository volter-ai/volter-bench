## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the resetting of creature states after a battle in the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a `_reset_creatures` method to the MainGameScene class.
2. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The `_reset_creatures` method will reset the HP of both the player's and opponent's creatures to their maximum values.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The game logic remains entirely within the scene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 31c8f8ad-a50b-4112-837a-8701ab222951
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures before transitioning
        self._reset_creatures()
        
        # Transition back to MainMenuScene after the battle ends

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding the `_reset_creatures` method and calling it before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that the creatures' states are reset after each battle, maintaining the game's functionality and meeting the specified requirements.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the missing logic for handling creatures with the same speed in the MainGameScene.

1. To fix this issue, I will modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check to see if the creatures have the same speed, and if so, we'll use Python's `random.choice` function to decide which creature goes first. This approach aligns with the architecture description and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7a33f3f6-94ba-42b2-9bc4-eab363d2b0fb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Both creatures have the same speed! {first_attacker.display_name}'s {first_creature.display_name} goes first!")
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding logic to handle the case when creatures have the same speed. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now check if the speeds are equal, and if so, we use `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first. We also added a message to inform the player when this situation occurs.

This solution maintains the existing model structure, adheres to the engine's capabilities, and fully implements the game logic as described in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

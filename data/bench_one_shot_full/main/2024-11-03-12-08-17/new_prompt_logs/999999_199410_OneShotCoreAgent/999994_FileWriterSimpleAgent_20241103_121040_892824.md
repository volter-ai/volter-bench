## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the Main Game Scene, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` in the `MainGameScene` class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP.
3. We'll call this method in the `_check_battle_end()` method, right before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as we're only modifying the scene logic.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c593f0d1-8765-49a8-8dec-e668078d6770
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            if player_skill is None:
                return

            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                return

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return None

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by resetting the state of all creatures (both player's and opponent's) when the battle ends, right before transitioning back to the Main Menu Scene. The `_reset_creatures_state()` method ensures that all creatures' HP is restored to their maximum value, preparing them for the next battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the resolution phase in the MainGameScene where it doesn't handle equal speed cases as specified in the architecture.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use random.choice to decide which creature goes first in that case. This aligns with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d61d4762-e568-4c4e-b2f4-0f3f2f05428a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)" for skill in skills])

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed: randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),

            if second_creature.hp > 0:

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense

        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to handle the case of equal speed as specified in the architecture. When the speeds are equal, it now uses `random.choice` to randomly decide which creature goes first, fulfilling the requirement that "If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged, maintaining compliance with the other architectural requirements and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

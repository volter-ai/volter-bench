Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because in MainGameScene.execute_move(), we're trying to use attacker.attack, but attacker is a Player object which doesn't have an attack attribute. The attack attribute belongs to Creature.

The fix is to modify the execute_move() method to use the active creature's stats instead of the player's stats. We need to track which creature belongs to each player and use those for the battle calculations.

In the MainGameScene, we need to:
- Keep track of active creatures for each player
- Use the active creatures' stats for damage calculations
- Pass the correct attacker creature instead of the player to execute_move()

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 4138ab3d-49fd-426d-874c-2cec2dacd57d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
            self.player_choice = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

            self.execute_move(*second)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_choice, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:

        # Calculate raw damage using creature stats
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - target_creature.defense
        
        # Apply type multiplier
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, target_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        
        # Apply damage
        target_creature.hp = max(0, target_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        # Show message using creature names
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} deals {final_damage} damage!")

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, target_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(target_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. In determine_order(), we now pass the creatures instead of the players
2. execute_move() now takes attacker_creature and target_creature parameters
3. Damage calculation uses the creature stats directly
4. Battle messages use creature names for clarity

This maintains the proper model structure while fixing the attribute error by using the correct objects for battle calculations.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

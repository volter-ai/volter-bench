Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that in `MainGameScene`, we're using `return` statements to exit the scene instead of properly transitioning back to the menu or quitting the game. According to the error message, we need to either:
1. Call `_transition_to_scene()` to go back to the menu after a battle ends
2. Call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game

Since this is a game where players should be able to play multiple battles, we should transition back to the menu after each battle. This follows the architecture because:
1. We're using the engine's scene transition capabilities
2. We're keeping the models as pure data schemas
3. We're handling all game logic in the scenes

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` before each `return` in the `run()` method
2. This ensures we properly transition back to the menu after a battle ends instead of just returning
3. The rest of the file remains unchanged since the issue was just with scene transitions

This should fix the test failure while maintaining proper architecture and engine usage.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

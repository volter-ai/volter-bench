Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that gets raised when transitioning back to the menu scene (which then quits). According to the engine's capabilities, we should catch this exception in our test since it's an expected part of the game flow.

The fix is to modify the test file to catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception, while still allowing the `RandomModeGracefulExit` to pass through. This maintains the architecture because:

1. We're not changing any models
2. We're working within the engine's exception handling system
3. We're properly testing scene transitions
4. We're keeping all game logic in the scenes

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 24d401e8-d1ca-4a0e-890a-10102dcac38e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for this complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully via menu transition, ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` from engine lib
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added informative print message when game quits gracefully
4. Left the `RandomModeGracefulExit` handler unchanged

This fix allows the test to handle both ways the game can end:
1. When random mode counter reaches 0 (RandomModeGracefulExit)
2. When transitioning back to menu and quitting (_QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass while maintaining proper architecture and testing methodology.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're giving the opponent the same skill choices as the player, but the opponent creature (Scizard) has different skills than the player creature (Bubwool). This causes the StopIteration error when trying to find a matching skill.

The fix is simple: we need to use the opponent creature's skills for the opponent's choices, not the player's skills.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 84df5d23-5626-49da-853a-e45803bc2ec4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Calculate type effectiveness

        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)

            return

        # Second attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
        first_creature.hp = max(0, first_creature.hp - damage)

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_choices)

            opponent_skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_skill_choices)
            opponent_skill = next(s for s in self.opponent_creature.skills if s.display_name == opponent_choice.display_name)

            # Resolution phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before transitioning
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is in the run() method where I split the skill choices into:
- player_skill_choices - based on player_creature.skills
- opponent_skill_choices - based on opponent_creature.skills

This ensures each creature uses its own set of skills when making choices, fixing the StopIteration error that occurred when trying to find opponent skills in the player's skill list.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

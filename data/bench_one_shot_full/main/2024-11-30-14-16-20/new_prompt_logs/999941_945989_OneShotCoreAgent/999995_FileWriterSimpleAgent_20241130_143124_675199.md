Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid choices. This happens because:
- All creatures are knocked out (hp = 0)
- Or the only creature with hp > 0 is the active creature

The fix needs to:
1. Check if there are any valid swap choices before offering the swap option
2. Only show "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Handle the case where a player has no valid moves (all creatures knocked out) by ending the battle

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_swap_creatures` helper method
2. Modified `get_player_action` to check available choices before offering them
3. Added null checks for when no valid actions are available
4. Added forced swap when a creature is knocked out
5. Added battle end checks before each turn
6. Improved error handling throughout the battle flow

This should resolve the "no choices" assertion error while maintaining the game's core mechanics and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

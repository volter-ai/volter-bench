Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine architecture, this exception is expected and should be caught. Looking at the other passing tests, they handle this by catching specific exceptions.

We need to modify `test_main_game_scene.py` to:
- Catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions
- Print appropriate success messages for both cases
- Follow the same pattern as the other passing tests

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 15958513-54fe-408c-acaa-56c9715d1d68
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` from engine lib
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added success message for game completion

This matches the engine's architecture where:
- `RandomModeGracefulExit` indicates the random moves limit was reached
- `_QuitWholeGame` indicates the game ended normally
- Both are expected and valid ways for the test to complete

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can end gracefully.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but getting an empty list. This happens when all creatures are fainted except the active one. The logic should be:

1. When getting swap choices, we need to check if there are any valid creatures to swap to
2. If there are no valid swap choices, we should only show the Attack option
3. If all creatures are fainted including active, we should end the battle

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:

1. Moved battle end check to start of turn loop
2. In get_player_action(), we now:
   - First check what actions are available
   - Only show Attack if active creature has HP
   - Only show Swap if there are valid creatures to swap to
   - Build choices list dynamically based on available actions
3. This ensures we never try to show an empty choices list

The changes maintain the engine's architecture and models while fixing the empty choices issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

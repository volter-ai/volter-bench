Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because in MainGameScene.execute_move(), we're trying to use attacker.attack, but attacker is a Player object which doesn't have an attack attribute. The attack attribute belongs to Creature.

The fix is to modify the execute_move() method to use the active creature's stats instead of the player's stats. We need to track which creature belongs to each player and use those for the battle calculations.

In the determine_order() and execute_move() methods, we should pass tuples containing both the player and their active creature, rather than just the player.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 6cb7f55f-7c92-44b7-a4ac-91994d900d6a

    def execute_move(self, attacker_info, target):
        owner, attacker, skill = attacker_info
        
        # Calculate raw damage using the creature's stats
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - target.defense
        
        # Apply type multiplier
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, target.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        
        # Apply damage
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{owner.display_name}'s {attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} for {final_damage} damage!")

        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(target_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Modified determine_order() to return tuples containing (owner, creature, skill) for each attacker
2. Updated execute_move() to unpack the attacker info tuple and use the creature's stats instead of trying to use the player's stats
3. Improved battle text to show both the owner and creature names

This maintains the proper model structure while fixing the attribute error by using the correct objects for stat calculations.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but not handling the case where all creatures are knocked out or when there are no valid swap options. This happens in get_player_action() when creating creature_choices.

We need to:
1. Always provide at least one choice to _wait_for_choice()
2. Add a "Back" button when showing skills/creatures
3. Handle the case where no swaps are available by returning to the main action menu

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added Back button to skill and creature selection menus
2. Added while True loop in get_player_action to handle Back button
3. Added minimum damage of 1 to prevent 0 damage attacks
4. Added forced creature swap when a creature faints
5. Added swap announcement messages
6. Made sure all _wait_for_choice calls have at least one option

The changes ensure we always have valid choices while maintaining the game's core mechanics and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine's architecture, when a scene ends via _quit_whole_game(), we need to catch and handle that exception in the test, similar to how we handle RandomModeGracefulExit.

The fix is to:
- Update the test to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
- Keep all models as pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Keep the scene's battle logic intact

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5f35517b-5a22-40b9-9bfc-c4b29169c7b6
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for this complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully via quit_whole_game, ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added informative print message for when the game ends gracefully

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both ways the scene can end:
- When the random mode counter reaches 0 (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- When the battle ends naturally (_QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass while still verifying that the scene works correctly through multiple random runs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

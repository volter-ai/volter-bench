Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is returning directly instead of properly ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()` or transitioning to another scene. According to the engine's architecture, scenes must explicitly end via one of these methods.

The fix is to:
- When the battle ends (win or lose), call `_quit_whole_game()` instead of returning
- Remove all direct returns from the scene
- Keep the game loop running until explicitly ended
- Keep all models as pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities by using proper scene transition methods

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `self.game_over` flag to properly control the game loop
2. Removed direct returns from the run method
3. Changed returns to continues in the game loop
4. Added proper `_quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends
5. Kept all model references and type checking intact
6. Maintained the scene's core battle mechanics while fixing the control flow

This should now properly end the game through the engine's mechanisms rather than returning directly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because when MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, and MainMenuScene calls quit_whole_game(), the QuitWholeGame exception is not being caught in the test.

The test needs to catch both possible ways the scene can end:
- TransitionFromScene (when transitioning between scenes)
- QuitWholeGame (when quitting the game)

The solution is to modify the test to catch both exceptions, similar to how test_main_menu_scene.py handles it.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: edfe4beb-6262-4342-9343-c12a8bd3e884
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch the transition method so we can catch it
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition, ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited via transition"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
2. Added proper mocking of _transition_to_scene to catch transitions
3. Added assertions to verify scene exits properly
4. Added better logging for different exit conditions

This matches the pattern used in test_main_menu_scene.py and properly handles all ways the scene can end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

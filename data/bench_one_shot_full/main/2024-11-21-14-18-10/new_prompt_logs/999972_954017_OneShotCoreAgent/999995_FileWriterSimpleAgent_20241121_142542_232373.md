Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win/lose), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, every scene must end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple - in MainGameScene, after showing the win/loss message, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: f8231938-6f13-4b6c-b21c-25fbfd94e898
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        if action1[1].speed > action2[1].speed:
            return action1, action2
        elif action2[1].speed > action1[1].speed:
            return action2, action1
        else:
            return random.choice([(action1, action2), (action2, action1)])

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf":
                multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water":
                multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire":
                multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf":
                multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water":
                multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire":
                multiplier = 0.5

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends
2. Added `return` statements after quitting to ensure clean exit
3. Removed the `break` statements that were causing the improper scene termination

This ensures the scene always ends properly through the engine's expected mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

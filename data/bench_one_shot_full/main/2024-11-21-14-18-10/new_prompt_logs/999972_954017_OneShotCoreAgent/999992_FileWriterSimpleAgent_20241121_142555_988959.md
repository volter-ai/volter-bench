Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because `_quit_whole_game()` raises an exception that needs to be caught in the test. Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see the correct pattern - we should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions.

The fix is simple - we need to update the test file to properly catch the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This matches how the engine expects graceful termination to work.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 630e2328-eb9e-41d6-9383-6f010d481696
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game ends gracefully

This ensures we properly handle both ways the game can end:
- When random mode counter reaches 0 (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- When the battle ends naturally (_QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass since it properly catches all expected exceptions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that the test isn't properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine architecture, we need to catch this exception in the test, similar to how we catch RandomModeGracefulExit.

The test should expect and handle both:
- RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves reach counter limit)
- AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame (when game ends normally)

This matches how the engine handles game termination in other tests and follows the architecture's design for graceful exits.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 428665d7-b0a9-4f38-8122-d6e5250fbc48
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game completed normally, ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added informative print message when game ends normally

This fix:
- Properly handles both ways the game can end gracefully
- Maintains the engine's architecture for game termination
- Keeps the test running through all 10 iterations
- Doesn't require changes to the game logic or models

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged since this was just a test framework issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference undefined variables `player_action` and `bot_action`. The issue is that we're trying to determine which player made the action by comparing the entire action tuple, but these variables aren't in scope.

The fix is to modify the execute_action method to determine the attacker by storing the player/bot actions as class attributes during resolve_turn, or better yet, pass the attacker directly when calling execute_action. This maintains clean architecture and avoids scope issues.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Modified resolve_turn to determine and pass the attacker directly to execute_action
2. Updated execute_action signature to take the attacker as a parameter
3. Removed the problematic action comparison that caused the NameError

This maintains clean architecture while fixing the scope issue. The scene still handles all game logic, models remain pure data schemas, and the engine's capabilities are respected.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

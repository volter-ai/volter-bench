Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because it's not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs when transitioning back to MainMenuScene (which then quits). 

According to the engine architecture:
- Scenes must end with either transition or quit
- _QuitWholeGame is an expected exception that should be caught
- Tests should handle both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
- The test should verify the scene ran successfully before exiting

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: c7c2fca9-569e-4f78-b13c-1d8123c8bfc6
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for this complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully after battle. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added handling for unexpected exceptions to fail the test properly
3. Added more descriptive print messages for debugging
4. Maintained the existing RandomModeGracefulExit handling

This fix:
- Follows the engine's architecture for scene transitions and quitting
- Properly handles all expected exceptions
- Maintains test coverage of the battle scene
- Keeps the models as pure data schemas
- Stays within the engine's capabilities

The test will now pass while still verifying the battle scene's functionality through random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the battle ends. This is similar to how the MainMenuScene test handles scene transitions.

We need to:
- Catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test
- Consider it a valid end condition for the battle scene
- The test should pass since a battle ending (via quit_whole_game) is an expected outcome

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 84b35a4e-4924-47d2-9931-d028c0349090
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle ended naturally with a winner/loser. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene did not end in an expected way")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Added else clause to fail if neither expected end condition occurs
4. Added descriptive print statement for battle end condition

This maintains the architecture and engine capabilities while properly handling the expected battle end condition through the quit_whole_game mechanism.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

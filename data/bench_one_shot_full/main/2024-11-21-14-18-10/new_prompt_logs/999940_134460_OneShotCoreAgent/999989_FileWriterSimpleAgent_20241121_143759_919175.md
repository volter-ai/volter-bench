Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that the MainGameScene is breaking from its game loop without properly ending the game. According to the error message and engine guidelines, we need to call either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()` when the game ends, rather than just breaking from the loop.

The fix is simple:
- When the battle ends (win or lose), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly signal game completion
- This maintains the engine's scene transition patterns
- Keeps models as pure data schemas
- Stays within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when:
   - No valid actions available for either player
   - Battle ends (win or loss condition met)
2. Added `return` statements after `_quit_whole_game()` to ensure clean exit
3. Maintained all other functionality and architecture

This ensures the scene properly signals completion to the engine rather than just breaking from its loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in the test file - we need to catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test, since this is an expected exception when the game ends. According to the error message: "If you intended to quit the game, this exception is expected and should be caught".

The fix is simple:
- Add exception handling in the test for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
- This matches the engine's design where game termination is signaled via this exception
- No changes needed to models or scene logic
- Stays within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 52ef1bcc-5709-4ca5-a50c-2c98eaa1bf55
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully. Ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` from engine lib
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added success message when game completes normally
4. Maintained all other test functionality

This ensures the test properly handles the expected game termination exception while still catching random mode exits.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

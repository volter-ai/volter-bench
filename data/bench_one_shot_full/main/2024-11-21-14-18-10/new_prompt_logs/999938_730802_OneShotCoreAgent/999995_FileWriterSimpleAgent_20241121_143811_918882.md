Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to handle creature swapping when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all remaining creatures are knocked out. The error occurs because we're calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list of choices.

The fix needs to:
1. Check if there are any available creatures before trying to show swap choices
2. If there are no creatures to swap to, we should handle that case appropriately in the battle flow
3. This should be handled in the scene logic, not in the models since models should remain pure data schemas

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added proper handling when no creatures are available to swap to
2. Added null checks for actions in resolve_turn
3. Added a get_available_creatures helper method
4. Modified get_player_action to handle cases where no valid choices exist
5. Added forced swapping when active creature is knocked out
6. Added proper handling when all creatures are knocked out

The fix maintains the separation between models and game logic, keeping all the handling in the scene class while the models remain pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we forgot to import BotListener in the MainGameScene. However, checking the listener type directly in the scene violates separation of concerns. Instead, we should handle this through the engine's existing listener system.

The fix will:
1. Remove the listener type checking from MainGameScene
2. Use the existing listener system to handle choices consistently
3. Keep models as pure data schemas
4. Stay within the engine's capabilities by using _wait_for_choice

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

```

Key changes:
1. Removed BotListener type checking
2. Now check if current_player is the human player (self.player) to determine if Back button should be shown
3. Kept the same model structure and scene architecture
4. Used the engine's existing _wait_for_choice system
5. Maintained separation between models and game logic

This fix:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Keeps models as pure data schemas
- Maintains proper separation of concerns
- Fixes the NameError
- Preserves the Back button functionality for human players only

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
Certainly. I'll provide a corrected version of the code that addresses the issue of passing a uid prop to custom components, and ensure all other guidelines are followed. Here's the corrected code:

# Excerpt ID: ab83cb74-73b0-489e-9978-7ca8228c1131
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  uid: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
      <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        Creature Battle Game
      </div>

      <div className="text-2xl text-white">
        Welcome, {playerName}!
      </div>

      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 mb-16">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="bg-green-500 hover:bg-green-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
            uid={`play-button-${props.data.uid}`}
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" /> Play Game
          </Button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white font-bold py-3 px-6 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center text-xl"
            uid={`quit-button-${props.data.uid}`}
          >
            <X className="mr-2" /> Quit Game
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this corrected version:

1. I've imported the `Button` component from "@/components/ui/button", assuming it's a custom UI component from shadcn/ui.

2. I've added a `uid` property to the `GameUIData` interface, as it seems this should be available based on the provided VIEW_DATA.

3. I've replaced the standard HTML `button` elements with the custom `Button` component.

4. Each `Button` component now receives a `uid` prop, constructed using the button's purpose and the scene's uid.

5. The rest of the implementation remains the same, maintaining the use of Tailwind CSS for styling, handling potential missing data, and using the specified imports.

This version should now correctly pass uid props to custom components, while still adhering to all other guidelines provided.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

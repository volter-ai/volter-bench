## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for overlooking this important aspect of the battle mechanics. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated MainGameScene implementation.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement the correct turn order based on creature speed, we'll make the following changes:

a. In the run() method, instead of executing player and opponent turns separately, we'll determine the turn order at the beginning of each round.

b. We'll create a new method called _determine_turn_order() that compares the speed of both creatures and returns a list of creatures in the order they should act.

c. If the speeds are equal, we'll use random.choice() to decide which creature goes first.

d. We'll then iterate through this ordered list to execute each creature's turn.

e. We'll keep the existing _player_turn() and _opponent_turn() methods, but rename them to _execute_player_turn() and _execute_opponent_turn() to better reflect their new role.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

```

This implementation now correctly handles the turn order based on creature speed, including the case where speeds are equal. The battle logic follows the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and we've made no changes to the `models.py` file.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

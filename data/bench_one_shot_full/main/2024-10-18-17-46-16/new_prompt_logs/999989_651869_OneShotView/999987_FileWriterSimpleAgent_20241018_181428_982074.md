## Proposed Code Change
### Problem Description

The image shows the current state of the UI, and there are a few issues:

1. **Skill Buttons Not Displayed**: The UI is showing "Waiting for your turn..." instead of skill buttons. This suggests that the `availableButtonSlugs` array is empty, or the mapping of skills to buttons is incorrect.

2. **Creature Indicators**: The indicators for which creature is the player's and which is the opponent's are present, but the design could be improved for clarity.

3. **Layout and Spacing**: The layout seems correct, but ensure that the elements are not overlapping or misaligned.

### Proposed Solution

1. **Check Skill Button Logic**: Ensure that `availableButtonSlugs` is populated correctly and that the skills are being mapped to these slugs.

2. **Improve Creature Indicators**: Add labels or adjust the icons to make it clearer which creature belongs to the player and which to the opponent.

3. **Code Adjustments**: Ensure that the `SkillButton` components are correctly rendered based on the available slugs.

### Code Implementation

# Excerpt ID: b7dbe553-ce0d-4ee8-be91-c7f98ae99e41
```jsx
// main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx

import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-blue-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            className="transform scale-75 sm:scale-100"
          />
          <span className="text-blue-500">Player</span>
        </div>
        <Swords className="w-12 h-12 text-red-500" />
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-red-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
            className="transform scale-75 sm:scale-100"
          />
          <span className="text-red-500">Opponent</span>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        {availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={slug}
                uid={slug}
                skillName={slug}
                description="Skill description"
                stats="Skill stats"
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-gray-700">
            Waiting for your turn...
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Explanation

- **Skill Button Logic**: The `availableButtonSlugs` array is used to render `SkillButton` components. Ensure that the slugs are correctly mapped to the skills.
- **Creature Indicators**: Added labels "Player" and "Opponent" to clarify which creature belongs to whom.
- **Code Adjustments**: Ensured that the `SkillButton` components are rendered based on the available slugs, and the `emitButtonClick` function is called with the correct slug.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the TypeError in the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to pass a `winner` argument to the `_transition_to_scene` method, which doesn't accept this parameter. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to store the winner as an instance variable before transitioning to the `BattleResultScene`.
2. We'll update the `BattleResultScene` to retrieve the winner from the `MainGameScene` instead of receiving it as a parameter.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify any models or add new methods to the data schemas.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 924e2604-74b7-4382-bd35-5cc7cc7178d5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None
        self.winner = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.opponent_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended, self.winner = self.check_battle_end()
            if battle_ended:
                self._transition_to_scene("BattleResultScene")
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if self.check_battle_end()[0]:
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self):
        player_tuple = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        opponent_tuple = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return player_tuple, opponent_tuple
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return opponent_tuple, player_tuple
        else:
            return random.choice([(player_tuple, opponent_tuple), (opponent_tuple, player_tuple)])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True, self.opponent
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True, self.player
        return False, None
```

Now, let's update the `battle_result_scene.py` file to retrieve the winner from the `MainGameScene`:

# Excerpt ID: 6f0af43c-1ecf-4f13-9813-ebc854b51328
```python main_game/scenes/battle_result_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class BattleResultScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.winner = None

    def __str__(self):
        result = "You win!" if self.winner == self.player else "You lose!"
        return f"""===Battle Result===
{result}

> Return to Main Menu
> Quit Game
"""

    def run(self):
        # Retrieve the winner from the MainGameScene
        main_game_scene = self._app.scene_registry["MainGameScene"](self._app, self.player)
        self.winner = main_game_scene.winner
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
            quit_button = Button("Quit Game")
            choices = [return_button, quit_button]
            
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if choice == return_button:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            elif choice == quit_button:
                self._quit_whole_game()
                return
```

These changes should resolve the TypeError by removing the `winner` argument from the `_transition_to_scene` method call in `MainGameScene` and instead retrieving the winner in the `BattleResultScene`. This solution maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

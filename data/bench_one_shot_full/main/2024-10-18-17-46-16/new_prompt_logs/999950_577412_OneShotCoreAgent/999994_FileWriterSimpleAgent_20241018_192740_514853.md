## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random speed tie resolution:
   - In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a check for equal speed and use `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first in case of a tie.

2. Explicitly handle 'normal' type effectiveness:
   - In the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, we'll add a specific check for the 'normal' type to ensure it's neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The speed tie is now resolved randomly using `random.choice([True, False])` in the `resolve_turn` method.
2. The 'normal' type effectiveness is explicitly handled in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, ensuring it always returns a factor of 1 for normal-type skills.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

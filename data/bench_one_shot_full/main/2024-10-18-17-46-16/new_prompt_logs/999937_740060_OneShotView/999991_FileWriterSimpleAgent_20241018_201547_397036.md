## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, 16:9 aspect ratio container for the game. Inside this container, we'll use flexbox to position the title at the top and the buttons at the bottom.

3. Title:
   We'll create a large, centered title using Tailwind classes for styling.

4. Buttons:
   We'll map through the available button slugs and create buttons for each one. We'll use the emitButtonClick function to handle button clicks.

5. Background:
   We'll add a background color or gradient using Tailwind classes.

6. Responsive Design:
   We'll use Tailwind's responsive classes to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes.

7. Error Handling:
   We'll add null checks and default values to handle cases where data might be missing.

8. Icons:
   We'll use Lucide icons for the buttons to enhance the visual appeal.

Implementation using Tailwind CSS:

- We'll use `min-h-screen` and `flex` to create a full-height container.
- `aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9` will maintain the 16:9 aspect ratio.
- `flex-col justify-between` will position the title at the top and buttons at the bottom.
- `text-4xl md:text-6xl` for responsive title size.
- `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4` for responsive button layout.
- `bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600` for a gradient background.

Now, let's rewrite the CURRENT_CODE with the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 2dbbaebe-9b16-473f-b91b-7f97e4c3420c
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react'

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerName = props.data.entities.player?.display_name || "Player";

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: "Play", icon: Play },
    quit: { text: "Quit", icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-4xl aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex flex-col justify-between p-8">
        <div className="text-center">
          <h1 className="text-4xl md:text-6xl font-bold text-white mb-4">Creature Battle</h1>
          <p className="text-xl text-white">Welcome, {playerName}!</p>
        </div>

        <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
            const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
            if (!config) return null;

            return (
              <button
                key={slug}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                className="flex items-center justify-center bg-white bg-opacity-20 hover:bg-opacity-30 text-white py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition duration-300"
              >
                <config.icon className="mr-2" size={24} />
                {config.text}
              </button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a responsive main menu scene with a gradient background, centered title, and dynamically rendered buttons based on the available button slugs. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Lucide icons for the buttons. The layout is designed to fit a 16:9 aspect ratio and will adapt to different screen sizes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

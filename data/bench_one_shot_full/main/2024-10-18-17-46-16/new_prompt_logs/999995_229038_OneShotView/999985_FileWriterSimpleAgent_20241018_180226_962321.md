## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can see that the main issue causing the timeout error is likely related to the game state not progressing. The UI is rendered correctly, but it seems to be stuck in a waiting state. Here's a detailed analysis and proposed solution:

1. Description of the issue:
The image shows the battlefield with two creatures (Bubwool) on either side, their health bars, and the "Waiting for your turn..." message in the user interface area. The problem is that the game appears to be stuck in this waiting state, which is causing the timeout error.

2. Proposed solution:
The issue might be caused by the game not properly transitioning from the waiting state to the player's turn. We need to ensure that the game state is properly updated and that the UI reflects these changes. Here's what we can do:

a. Add a check for the player's turn in the UI rendering logic.
b. Ensure that the `availableButtonSlugs` are properly populated when it's the player's turn.
c. Add a loading state to handle transitions between turns more smoothly.

3. Implementation of the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 32c50d49-ea3f-4fd3-ab15-c8b071bddbf2
```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface Creature {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
}

interface Skill {
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
  is_player_turn: boolean;
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(true);

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate a short delay to allow for state updates
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false);
    }, 1000);

    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }, [props.data.is_player_turn]);

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex flex-col bg-gray-100">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-2">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold">Battle Arena</h1>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex-grow flex justify-between items-center p-4">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-blue-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={playerCreature.uid}
            name={playerCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={playerCreature.stats.hp}
            className="transform scale-75 sm:scale-100"
          />
        </div>
        <Swords className="w-12 h-12 text-red-500" />
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center">
          <Shield className="w-8 h-8 mb-2 text-red-500" />
          <CreatureCard
            uid={botCreature.uid}
            name={botCreature.display_name}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.jpg"
            hp={botCreature.stats.hp}
            className="transform scale-75 sm:scale-100"
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* User Interface */}
      <div className="bg-gray-200 p-4 h-1/3 overflow-y-auto">
        {isLoading ? (
          <div className="text-center text-gray-700">
            Loading...
          </div>
        ) : props.data.is_player_turn && availableButtonSlugs.length > 0 ? (
          <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
            {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={slug}
                uid={slug}
                skillName={slug}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-gray-700">
            {props.data.is_player_turn ? "Your turn!" : "Waiting for your turn..."}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Adding an `is_player_turn` property to the `GameUIData` interface to track whose turn it is.
2. Introducing a loading state to handle transitions between turns.
3. Updating the UI rendering logic to show the correct message based on the game state.
4. Ensuring that skill buttons are only rendered when it's the player's turn and there are available skills.

These modifications should help prevent the timeout error by ensuring that the game state progresses correctly and the UI updates accordingly.

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue raised during QA/testing. To fix this problem, we need to implement the forced swap functionality when a creature is knocked out. Here's how I plan to address this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to check if the active creature of either player has been knocked out after each attack.
2. If a creature is knocked out, we'll call the `_force_swap` method for the affected player.
3. If the `_force_swap` method returns False (indicating no available creatures), we'll end the battle.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the existing architecture and models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

                return True  # Battle should end

```

This solution addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing phase:

1. We've added a new method `_check_and_force_swap` that checks if a player's active creature has been knocked out and forces a swap if necessary.
2. The `_resolution_phase` method now calls `_check_and_force_swap` after each action, ensuring that players are prompted to swap creatures when their active creature is knocked out.
3. If a player has no more creatures available, the battle ends immediately.

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` implements the forced swap functionality as described in the architecture, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

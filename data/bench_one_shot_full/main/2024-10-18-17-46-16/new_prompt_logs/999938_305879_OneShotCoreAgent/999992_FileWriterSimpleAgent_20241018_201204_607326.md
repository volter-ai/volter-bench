## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle end condition is not properly handled.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll modify the main game loop to break when the battle ends and then transition to the main menu.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow of the game.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 758644cb-fb47-4aa6-8fe9-853926294b8a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `run` method now breaks out of the main game loop when `check_battle_end` returns `True`.
2. After the battle ends, the scene transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.
3. The `check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean value, which is used to determine when to exit the main game loop.

These modifications ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by transitioning to another scene (in this case, back to the main menu) when the battle ends. This should resolve the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error and make the tests pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The main problem appears to be that the skill buttons are not visible in the user interface area. This could be causing the timeout error as the game might be waiting for user input that isn't available.

2. The "Waiting for opponent..." message is displayed, which suggests that the availableButtonSlugs array might be empty.

3. The creature images are not being displayed correctly, as placeholder images are shown instead.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Ensure that the skill buttons are always rendered, even when availableButtonSlugs is empty. We'll disable the buttons instead of not rendering them.

2. Add a check to display the "Waiting for opponent..." message only when there are no skills available for the player's creature.

3. Update the image URLs for the creatures to use the correct paths.

Here's the implemented solution:

            {player_creature.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                skillName={skill.display_name}

                stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}, Type: ${skill.meta.skill_type}`}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-lg">
            Waiting for opponent...
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Updated the condition for rendering skill buttons to check if the player's creature has any skills, rather than relying on availableButtonSlugs.
2. Changed the image URLs for creatures to use dynamic paths based on the creature's UID.
3. Kept the "Waiting for opponent..." message, but it will only show if the player's creature has no skills.

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the skill buttons are always rendered (when available) and properly disabled when not in availableButtonSlugs. The creature images should now display correctly as well.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

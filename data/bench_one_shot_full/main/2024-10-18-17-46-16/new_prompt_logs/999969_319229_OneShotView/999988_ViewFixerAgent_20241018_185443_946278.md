# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Can you please fix the following issue?

Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The main problem appears to be that the skill buttons are not visible in the user interface area. This could be causing the timeout error as the game might be waiting for user input that isn't available.

2. The "Waiting for opponent..." message is displayed, which suggests that the availableButtonSlugs array might be empty.

3. The creature images are not being displayed correctly, as placeholder images are shown instead.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Ensure that the skill buttons are always rendered, even when availableButtonSlugs is empty. We'll disable the buttons instead of not rendering them.

2. Add a check to display the "Waiting for opponent..." message only when there are no skills available for the player's creature.

3. Update the image URLs for the creatures to use the correct paths.

Here's the implemented solution:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Sword, Zap } from 'lucide-react';
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";

                disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
          </div>
        ) : (
          <div className="text-center text-lg">
            Waiting for opponent...
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The main changes made are:

1. Updated the condition for rendering skill buttons to check if the player's creature has any skills, rather than relying on availableButtonSlugs.
2. Changed the image URLs for creatures to use dynamic paths based on the creature's UID.
3. Kept the "Waiting for opponent..." message, but it will only show if the player's creature has no skills.

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by ensuring that the skill buttons are always rendered (when available) and properly disabled when not in availableButtonSlugs. The creature images should now display correctly as well.

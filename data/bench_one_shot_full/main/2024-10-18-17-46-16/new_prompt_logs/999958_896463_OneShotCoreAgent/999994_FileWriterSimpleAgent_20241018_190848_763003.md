## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing explicit handling for the 'Normal' type in type relationships, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. Update the `calculate_effectiveness` method to explicitly handle the 'Normal' type.
2. Modify the effectiveness chart to include 'Normal' type interactions.

This change will ensure that the 'Normal' type is properly handled in type relationships, as specified in the documentation. The modification will stay within the capabilities of the engine and won't require changes to the models or overall architecture.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7a03befd-9ef7-4909-8caa-9f75bf919581
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
> {self.player_creature.skills[1].display_name}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        effectiveness = self.calculate_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(effectiveness * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "normal": {"fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation explicitly handles the 'Normal' type in the `calculate_effectiveness` method. The effectiveness chart now includes 'Normal' type interactions, ensuring that it is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types, as specified in the documentation. This change addresses the issue raised during QA/testing while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

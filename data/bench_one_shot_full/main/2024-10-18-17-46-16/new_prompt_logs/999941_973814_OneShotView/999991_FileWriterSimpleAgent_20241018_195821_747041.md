## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll explain the architecture and implementation approach for the MainMenuSceneView component, and then provide the updated code.

Architecture and Implementation Approach:

1. Component Structure:
   We'll create a single functional component called MainMenuSceneView that takes the GameUIData as props.

2. Layout:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes to create a full-screen, centered layout with a 16:9 aspect ratio. The main content will be divided into two main sections: the top section for the game title and the bottom section for the buttons.

3. Game Title:
   We'll display the game title using a large, bold text at the top of the screen. Since we don't have an actual image asset, we'll use styled text as a placeholder.

4. Button Section:
   We'll create a flex container for the buttons at the bottom of the screen. We'll map through the available button slugs and render buttons accordingly.

5. Button Handling:
   We'll use the useCurrentButtons hook to get the available button slugs and the emitButtonClick function. We'll render buttons based on the available slugs and attach the emitButtonClick function to each button.

6. Styling:
   We'll use Tailwind CSS classes for styling, including responsive design, centering, and proper spacing. We'll also add some basic animations for button hover states.

7. Background:
   We'll add a gradient background to the main container to give it a game-like feel.

8. Error Handling:
   We'll implement null checks and fallback rendering to handle potential missing data.

Now, let's implement the component:

# Excerpt ID: bc2803e7-5997-461a-8e43-53d64fb99e26
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const { availableButtonSlugs, emitButtonClick } = useCurrentButtons();

  const buttonConfig = {
    play: { text: 'Play', icon: Play },
    quit: { text: 'Quit', icon: X },
  };

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-500 to-purple-600">
      <div className="w-full max-w-[177.78vh] aspect-video bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        <div className="text-6xl font-bold text-white mt-16 animate-pulse">
          Awesome Game Title
        </div>
        
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 mb-16">
          {availableButtonSlugs.map((slug) => {
            const config = buttonConfig[slug as keyof typeof buttonConfig];
            if (!config) return null;
            
            return (
              <button
                key={slug}
                onClick={() => emitButtonClick(slug)}
                className="flex items-center justify-center space-x-2 bg-white text-black px-8 py-3 rounded-full text-xl font-semibold transition-all duration-200 hover:bg-opacity-80 hover:scale-105"
              >
                <config.icon className="w-6 h-6" />
                <span>{config.text}</span>
              </button>
            );
          })}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates a full-screen main menu with a gradient background. The game title is displayed at the top, and the available buttons are shown at the bottom. The buttons are styled and include icons from Lucide React. The layout is responsive and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio.

The component uses Tailwind CSS for styling, including flexbox for layout, responsive text sizes, and hover effects for buttons. It also includes some basic animations like the pulsing effect on the game title.

Error handling is implemented by checking if the button configuration exists before rendering each button. The component is also safe against missing data in the props, as it doesn't directly use any of the passed data (which could be extended if needed).

This implementation should provide a solid foundation for the main menu scene, following the requirements and best practices you've outlined.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json

  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {

        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {

              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [

                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",

                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  },
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 5

                      "is_physical": true
                    },
                    "entities": {},

                  }

              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",

    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play-game
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (prominent)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative
     - Bottom: Button container

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom trick
   - Center content both horizontally and vertically
   - Use consistent spacing and sizing

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with relative positioning
   - Inner container for content with absolute positioning
   - Button group with flex layout
   - Responsive text sizing for title

4. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Use `useCurrentButtons` hook for button availability
   - Handle button clicks through `emitButtonClick`
   - Conditional rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface PlayerStats {
  stat1: number;
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: PlayerStats;
  display_name: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  return (
    <div className="relative w-full" style={{ paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
        {/* Title Section */}
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white text-center tracking-wider">
            GAME TITLE
          </h1>
        </div>

        {/* Button Section */}
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 w-full max-w-md">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play-game') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play-game')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 w-full py-4 bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
            >
              <Play className="w-6 h-6" />
              Play Game
            </button>
          )}

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 w-full py-4 bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg text-xl transition-colors"
            >
              <XCircle className="w-6 h-6" />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a responsive 16:9 container using padding-bottom trick
- Uses a gradient background for visual interest
- Centers the title in the upper portion
- Places buttons at the bottom with proper spacing
- Includes icons from Lucide for visual enhancement
- Handles button availability through the provided hook
- Uses Tailwind for all styling
- Is responsive and maintains aspect ratio
- Includes proper TypeScript interfaces
- Has fail-safes for button rendering based on availability

The buttons are styled with hover states and transitions for better interactivity, and the layout should work well across different screen sizes while maintaining the 16:9 aspect ratio.

  "explanation": "Let me review the code against the requirements:\n\n1. UID Props:\n- The code doesn't pass any uid props to custom components, but we're not actually using any custom UI components in this implementation (we're just using native buttons with Tailwind styling)\n- The interfaces correctly include uid fields for the data structures\n\n2. Guidelines Review:\n\u2713 Kept named exports and existing imports\n\u2713 Uses elvis operators and null checks (through availableButtonSlugs.includes())\n\u2713 Only uses basic HTML/Tailwind (no shadcn components needed for this simple menu)\n\u2713 Properly imports Lucide icons\n\u2713 Maintains 16:9 aspect ratio\n\u2713 Handles button states correctly\n\nHowever, there are a few issues:\n- We should use the shadcn/ui Button component since it was mentioned it's available\n- The Player interface is oversimplified compared to the VIEW_DATA example\n- We should handle the case where props.data might be undefined\n\nThe code needs some adjustments to fully comply with the requirements.",

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added proper interfaces matching the VIEW_DATA structure
2. Used shadcn Button component with appropriate variants
3. Added null safety checks for props.data
4. Added proper type checking with TypeScript interfaces
5. Maintained all the layout and styling benefits from before
6. Added elvis operators for availableButtonSlugs checks
7. Kept the 16:9 aspect ratio container
8. Properly typed the BaseEntity interface with common properties
9. Used proper button variants (default for play, destructive for quit)
10. Maintained consistent spacing and sizing

The component now properly follows all the guidelines while maintaining the same visual structure and functionality.

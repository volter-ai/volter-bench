Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"

interface SkillButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {

          <Button ref={ref} uid={uid} {...props}>
            {name}
          </Button>
        </HoverCardTrigger>
        <HoverCardContent uid={uid}>
          <div className="space-y-2">
            <h4 className="font-medium leading-none">{name}</h4>
            <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">{description}</p>
            <div className="flex flex-col gap-1 text-sm">

            </div>
          </div>
        </HoverCardContent>

    )
  }
)

SkillButton.displayName = "SkillButton"

SkillButton = withClickable(SkillButton)

            <Progress uid={`${uid}-progress`} value={(currentHp / maxHp) * 100} />
          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Use a flex-column layout for the entire 16:9 container
- Divide into three main sections:
  * Top: HUD/Nav bar (1/6 height)
  * Middle: Battlefield (3/6 height)
  * Bottom: UI/Controls area (2/6 height)

2. Component Organization:
- Main container with flex-col
- Battlefield using flex-row with justify-between for creature spacing
- Skills area using grid layout for button arrangement

3. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for data access
- Implement null checks for collections

4. Styling Strategy:
- Use Tailwind classes for layout:
  * `flex flex-col h-screen` for main container
  * `flex-1 flex items-center justify-between` for battlefield
  * `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4` for skills area
- Responsive considerations using Tailwind's responsive prefixes

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, Zap } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"

  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
    attack: number

  collections: {

This implementation:
1. Creates proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Uses the custom components as specified
3. Implements a clean layout with proper spacing
4. Handles null cases with optional chaining
5. Uses Tailwind for responsive layout
6. Includes player/opponent labels
7. Shows skills in a grid layout
8. Uses Lucide icons for the HUD

The component assumes image paths follow a convention of `/creatures/{prototype_id}.png`. You'll need to ensure these images exist in your public folder.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

We're not handling the case where availableButtonSlugs might restrict which skills are shown\n3. The meta property access for prototype_id isn't safely checked\n4.

```

Changes made:
1. Removed unnecessary uid attributes from non-custom components
2. Added filtering of skills based on availableButtonSlugs
3. Added safe image URL handling with getCreatureImageUrl helper
4. Removed redundant key props since uid is sufficient
5. Added meta type information to interfaces
6. Added proper null checking for all object access
7. Added fallback default image path

The code now properly follows all guidelines for custom component usage and data safety.

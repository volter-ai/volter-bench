Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Player",
        "description": "A creature trainer"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex layout with vertical direction
   - Two main sections: Title area (top) and Button area (bottom)

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom trick
   - Center content both horizontally and vertically
   - Create a game-like feel with proper spacing and scaling

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with background styling
   - Title section taking ~40% of vertical space
   - Button section taking ~60% of vertical space
   - Buttons will be conditionally rendered based on availableButtonSlugs

4. **Responsive Approach**:
   - Scale content to fit screen while maintaining aspect ratio
   - Use relative units (rem) for spacing
   - Ensure text remains readable at different scales

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface GameStats {
  [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
  prototype_id: string;
  category: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
  __type: string;
  stats: GameStats;
  meta: GameMeta;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any[]>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
  __type: 'Player';
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  return (
    <div className="relative w-full h-0 pb-[56.25%] bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-800 to-slate-900">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8">
        {/* Title Section */}
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
            CREATURE GAME
          </h1>
        </div>

        {/* Button Section */}
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mb-16">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 
                       bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-500 
                       text-white text-xl font-semibold rounded-lg 
                       transition-colors duration-200"
            >
              <Play size={24} />
              Play Game
            </button>
          )}

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 
                       bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-500 
                       text-white text-xl font-semibold rounded-lg 
                       transition-colors duration-200"
            >
              <XCircle size={24} />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom trick
- Uses a gradient background for visual appeal
- Centers the title in the upper portion
- Places buttons in the lower portion with proper spacing
- Includes icons from Lucide for better visual feedback
- Handles button availability through availableButtonSlugs
- Uses proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Implements hover effects and transitions for better UX
- Maintains responsiveness while keeping the aspect ratio

The buttons are styled with distinctive colors and include icons for better visual hierarchy. The layout is clean and focused, following the main menu conventions described in the requirements.

While we defined interfaces for the data structure, we didn't fully utilize the data from props.data which contains important game information.\n\n3. The styling is good with Tailwind, but we should ensure it integrates better with any existing shadcn components that might be available.\n\n4. We should add error boundaries or null checks for the data prop to make it more robust.\n\n5. The buttons should probably be using shadcn's Button component since it was mentioned we should use existing UI components.\n\nThese issues should be addressed before the code is used in production.",

        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 mb-16 w-full max-w-md">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
            <Button
              variant="default"
              size="lg"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
              className="w-full flex items-center justify-center gap-2 text-xl"

              <Play className="w-6 h-6" />
              Play Game
            </Button>
          )}

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <Button
              variant="destructive"
              size="lg"
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="w-full flex items-center justify-center gap-2 text-xl"

          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added proper null check for data prop
2. Used shadcn's Button component instead of raw HTML buttons
3. Added proper image placeholder for the title image
4. Improved accessibility with aria-label
5. Added max-width constraints for better scaling
6. Maintained the 16:9 aspect ratio
7. Used proper variants from shadcn's button component ('default' and 'destructive')
8. Included the uid in the GameUIData interface
9. Made the layout more robust with proper width constraints
10. Kept the consistent styling with Tailwind

The component now better follows the design requirements while using the proper UI components and maintaining type safety.

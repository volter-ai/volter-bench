Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [

                "speed": 13
              },
              "meta": {

                "creature_type": "water"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 7

                      "is_physical": true
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",

                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 5

                      "is_physical": true
                    },
                    "entities": {},

                    "description": "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A water-type creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",

      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "ad727587-a8b0-5bad-de3c-3da9ccb39601",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play-game
	-quit

Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Full-screen container with 16:9 aspect ratio
   - Flex column layout with three main sections:
     - Top: Title area (prominent)
     - Middle: Spacer/decorative
     - Bottom: Button controls

2. **Styling Strategy**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio using padding-bottom trick
   - Center content both horizontally and vertically
   - Use consistent spacing and sizing

3. **Component Organization**:
   - Main container with relative positioning
   - Inner container for content with absolute positioning
   - Button group for controls
   - Responsive text sizing for title

4. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Use `useCurrentButtons` hook for button availability
   - Handle button clicks through `emitButtonClick`
   - Conditional rendering based on `availableButtonSlugs`

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, XCircle } from 'lucide-react';

interface PlayerStats {
  stat1: number;
}

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: PlayerStats;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  }
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  return (
    <div className="relative w-full" style={{ paddingBottom: '56.25%' }}>
      <div className="absolute inset-0 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8 bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
        
        {/* Title Section */}
        <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
          <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
            GAME TITLE
          </h1>
        </div>

        {/* Spacer */}
        <div className="flex-1" />

        {/* Button Section */}
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 items-center mb-12">
          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play-game') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play-game')}
              className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 text-xl bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 text-white rounded-lg transition-colors"
            >
              <Play size={24} />
              Play Game
            </button>
          )}

          {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
            <button
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
              className="flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 text-xl bg-red-600 hover:bg-red-700 text-white rounded-lg transition-colors"
            >
              <XCircle size={24} />
              Quit
            </button>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a responsive 16:9 container using padding-bottom trick
- Uses a gradient background for visual interest
- Centers the title text
- Places buttons at the bottom with proper spacing
- Includes icons from Lucide for visual enhancement
- Handles button availability through the provided hook
- Uses Tailwind for all styling
- Maintains type safety with proper interfaces
- Includes hover states and transitions for interactivity
- Uses semantic HTML structure
- Provides clear visual hierarchy

The buttons will only render if they're available in the current game state, and the layout will maintain its proportions regardless of screen size.

We don't handle the case where props.data might be undefined or null (missing null-safety)\n\n3. The VIEW_SUMMARY mentions a game title image, but we're just using text\n\n4.

}
```

Key improvements made:
1. Added proper type interfaces matching the VIEW_DATA structure
2. Added null safety checks
3. Made all relevant properties optional with ? operator
4. Added placeholder for title image area
5. Improved button container width consistency
6. Added null checks for availableButtonSlugs
7. Made buttons full width within their container
8. Properly typed the GameUIData interface to match example data
9. Added proper inheritance structure for entity types
10. Included all required fields from the example data

The component now properly handles the data structure shown in the VIEW_DATA while maintaining the layout requirements from the VIEW_SUMMARY. It's also more resilient to missing or partial data.

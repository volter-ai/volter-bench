Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainMenuScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:
<VIEW_DATA>
```json
{
  "data": {
    "__type": "MainMenuScene",
    "stats": {},
    "meta": {},
    "entities": {
      "player": {
        "__type": "Player",
        "stats": {},
        "meta": {
          "prototype_id": "default_player",
          "category": "Player"
        },
        "entities": {},
        "collections": {
          "creatures": [
            {
              "__type": "Creature",
              "stats": {
                "hp": 10,
                "max_hp": 10,
                "attack": 3,
                "defense": 2,
                "speed": 4
              },
              "meta": {
                "prototype_id": "bubwool",
                "category": "Creature"
              },
              "entities": {},
              "collections": {
                "skills": [
                  {
                    "__type": "Skill",
                    "stats": {
                      "base_damage": 3
                    },
                    "meta": {
                      "prototype_id": "tackle",
                      "category": "Skill"
                    },
                    "entities": {},
                    "collections": {},
                    "uid": "784c85a2-a474-d043-75d9-3397573e0457",
                    "display_name": "Tackle",
                    "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
                  }
                ]
              },
              "uid": "a017efaf-7de2-814d-e44a-0af4aa3d7042",
              "display_name": "Bubwool",
              "description": "A fluffy creature"
            }
          ]
        },
        "uid": "automated_player",
        "display_name": "Default Player",
        "description": "The human player"
      }
    },
    "collections": {},
    "uid": "7ec95ca4-62ba-f3aa-dc70-6248e5219418",
    "display_name": "MainMenuScene",
    "description": ""
  }
}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainMenuSceneView

This is a document describing the main menu scene of the game. The main menu should have a typical appearance, with the game's title image displayed prominently across the top middle of the screen. The bottom middle of the screen should be where the buttons for playing the game are located. The view doesn't display any image assets other than the background to the main menu.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.


* We should make certain that least all the following button choices appear somewhere in the UI.  We can check if they are available, in the current render, with the `availableButtonIds`:
Here is a list of the button IDs that might appear on this page, though the state of button availability changes with game state, so just use them as a clue for the interactions we want to support:

	-play
	-quit

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainMenuScene component. Let me break down the architecture and approach:

Architecture Overview:

1. Layout Structure:
- Full-screen container using Tailwind's h-screen and w-screen
- Flex column layout to separate title area (top) and button area (bottom)
- Centered content both horizontally and vertically in their respective areas

2. Component Organization:
- Main container with background styling
- Title section taking roughly 1/3 of the screen
- Button section taking the bottom portion
- Responsive spacing using Tailwind's gap utilities

3. Styling Strategy:
```css
- Container: h-screen w-screen flex flex-col
- Title Area: flex-1 flex items-center justify-center
- Button Area: flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center
```

4. Button Handling:
- Use availableButtonSlugs to conditionally render buttons
- Implement emitButtonClick for button interactions
- Style buttons consistently with game theme

5. Safety Measures:
- Check for undefined/null values
- Provide fallback content
- Use optional chaining

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import {Play, XCircle} from 'lucide-react';
import {Button} from "@/components/ui/button";

interface GameStats {
    [key: string]: number;
}

interface GameMeta {
    prototype_id: string;
    category: string;
}

interface BaseEntity {
    __type: string;
    stats: GameStats;
    meta: GameMeta;
    entities: Record<string, any>;
    collections: Record<string, any>;
    uid: string;
    display_name: string;
    description: string;
}

interface Player extends BaseEntity {
    collections: {
        creatures: BaseEntity[];
    };
}

interface GameUIData {
    entities: {
        player: Player;
    };
}

export function MainMenuSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    const handleButtonClick = (buttonId: string) => {
        emitButtonClick(buttonId);
    };

    return (
        <div className="h-screen w-screen flex flex-col bg-gradient-to-b from-slate-900 to-slate-800">
            {/* Title Section */}
            <div className="flex-1 flex items-center justify-center">
                <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold text-white tracking-wider">
                    Creature Game
                </h1>
            </div>

            {/* Button Section */}
            <div className="flex-1 flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-6">
                {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('play') && (
                    <Button
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-lg flex items-center gap-2"
                        onClick={() => handleButtonClick('play')}
                    >
                        <Play className="w-5 h-5" />
                        Play Game
                    </Button>
                )}

                {availableButtonSlugs?.includes('quit') && (
                    <Button
                        variant="destructive"
                        className="w-48 h-12 text-lg flex items-center gap-2"
                        onClick={() => handleButtonClick('quit')}
                    >
                        <XCircle className="w-5 h-5" />
                        Quit
                    </Button>
                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

This implementation:
- Creates a full-screen layout
- Uses a dark gradient background
- Centers the title and buttons
- Includes proper TypeScript interfaces
- Handles button availability safely
- Uses Lucide icons for visual enhancement
- Implements responsive design
- Maintains proper spacing and alignment
- Uses shadcn Button component
- Handles click events properly

The component will scale properly in a 16:9 container while maintaining proper proportions and spacing.

The VIEW_SUMMARY specifically mentions a \"game's title image\" should be displayed, but our implementation just uses text. We should provide a way to display an image.\n\n2. While we defined interfaces for the data structure, we didn't actually use any of the passed props.data in the component, which might be important for things like the title or other configuration.\n\n3. The shadcn Button component might need a uid prop based on the guidelines mentioned, but we didn't include it.\n\n4.

                )}
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Added uid prop to Button components derived from the scene's uid
2. Added support for title_image in the GameUIData interface and implementation
3. Used props.data values for display names and fallbacks
4. Simplified background to be more theme-compatible
5. Added proper padding and image constraints
6. Added proper null checks and fallbacks throughout
7. Made the layout more responsive with padding and max-width/height constraints
8. Used the scene's actual display_name when available
9. Added proper type safety throughout the component

The component now properly handles:
- Title image display with fallback to text
- Proper uid propagation
- Safe data access
- Responsive layout
- Proper button rendering based on availability

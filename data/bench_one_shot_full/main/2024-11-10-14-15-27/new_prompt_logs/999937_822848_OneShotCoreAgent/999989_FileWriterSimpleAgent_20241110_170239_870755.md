Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending the game when the battle is over. When check_battle_end() returns True, we're just breaking from the loop instead of calling _quit_whole_game() to properly signal the end of the game.

According to the error message:
> Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again

We need to modify MainGameScene to properly end the game using _quit_whole_game() when a player wins or loses, rather than just breaking from the loop.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 4b0c5ebf-0d54-4045-a47f-05371e5abdc9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. In the run() method, when check_battle_end() returns True, we now call self._quit_whole_game() instead of just breaking
2. This properly signals to the engine that the game is ending
3. No changes were needed to the models or other parts of the architecture
4. We're staying within the engine's capabilities by using the provided _quit_whole_game() method

This should fix the test failure while maintaining the proper architecture and engine requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is an expected exception that should be caught according to the error message: "If you intended to quit the game, this exception is expected and should be caught".

We need to modify the test to catch this exception, similar to how we're handling TransitionFromScene in the main menu test. This maintains the architecture while working within the engine's capabilities.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d5d12992-d9ec-48d9-b21c-3ea1a7f5f523
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print("Game ended gracefully via _QuitWholeGame")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print("Random mode counter reached 0")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene did not end with expected exception")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added try/except block to catch _QuitWholeGame
3. Added else clause to fail the test if neither expected exception is raised
4. No changes needed to models or scene implementations
5. Maintains pure data schemas in models.py
6. Works within engine capabilities by properly handling the expected exception

This fix:
- Keeps the architecture intact
- Doesn't modify any game logic
- Properly handles the engine's expected behavior
- Maintains test coverage
- Follows all guidelines for models and scenes

The test will now pass while still verifying the correct behavior of the game scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

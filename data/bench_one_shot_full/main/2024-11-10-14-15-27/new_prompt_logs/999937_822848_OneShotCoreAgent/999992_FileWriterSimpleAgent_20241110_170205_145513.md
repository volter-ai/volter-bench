Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're not handling the case when a player has no valid choices for swapping creatures. This happens when all other creatures are knocked out or when the active creature is the only one left. We need to modify the get_player_action method to:

1. Check if there are valid swap choices before offering the swap option
2. Only show "Attack" if there are no valid swap choices
3. Keep the models as pure data schemas (no changes needed to models.py)

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are in the get_player_action method:
1. We check for valid swap creatures before offering choices
2. We only show the "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. We always show the "Attack" option since it's always valid
4. The rest of the logic remains the same

This fixes the issue while:
- Keeping models as pure data schemas
- Maintaining proper inheritance
- Staying within engine capabilities
- Following the architecture guidelines

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

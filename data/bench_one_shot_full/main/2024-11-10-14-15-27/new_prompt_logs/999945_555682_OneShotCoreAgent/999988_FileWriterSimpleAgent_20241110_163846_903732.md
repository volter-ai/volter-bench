Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:

The QA identified two missing requirements:
- "Back" option missing in player choice phase
- Random turn order for equal speed creatures

To fix these, I'll modify MainGameScene.py to:
1. Add a "Back" Button to both the attack and swap choice menus
2. Add random speed tie resolution in the resolve_turn method
3. Modify the choice flow to support returning to the main menu when "Back" is selected

The changes will use existing engine capabilities:
- Button for the "Back" option
- random.choice() for speed ties
- Existing choice system for menu navigation

2. Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" Button to both attack and swap choice menus
2. Modified get_player_action to support returning to main menu when "Back" is selected
3. Added random speed tie resolution using random.choice()
4. Improved the choice flow to properly handle back navigation

These changes fulfill the missing requirements while maintaining compatibility with the engine and existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is designed to catch either RandomModeGracefulExit or a scene transition, but when the random choices lead to quitting the game, the _QuitWholeGame exception is uncaught.

The solution is to:
1. Add _QuitWholeGame to the exceptions we catch in the test
2. Keep track of how the scene ended for debugging purposes
3. Make sure we assert that the scene ended in one of the expected ways

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 6c9807e4-ea44-4722-acdf-a215233e6b7f
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods to track how the scene ends
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned successfully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    pytest.fail("Scene did not end in an expected way")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the imports
2. Added a catch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in the try/except block
3. Added more detailed logging for how the scene ended
4. Added a pytest.fail() in the else clause to ensure the scene always ends in one of our expected ways
5. Simplified the test to focus on just the scene transitions since that's what we're testing

This maintains all the architectural requirements while properly handling all the ways the scene can end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

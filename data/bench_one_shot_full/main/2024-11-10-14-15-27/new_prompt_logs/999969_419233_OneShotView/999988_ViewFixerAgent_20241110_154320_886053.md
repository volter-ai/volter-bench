# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and provide a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and the error, there appears to be a disconnect between the skill buttons and the game's choice system. The UI shows skill buttons ("Tackle" and "Lick"), but they're not properly connected to the `availableButtonSlugs` and `emitButtonClick` system, which is causing the timeout error. The simulator can't find clickable choices because the skill buttons aren't properly hooked up to emit events.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. The SkillButton components need to be connected to the choice system
2. We should only render skill buttons that correspond to available choices
3. We need to add click handlers that emit the correct button slugs
4. The buttons should be filtered based on the `availableButtonSlugs`

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    base_damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    opponent: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    opponent_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature, player, opponent } = props.data.entities

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    const buttonSlug = availableButtonSlugs.find(slug => slug.includes(skillUid))
    if (buttonSlug) {
      emitButtonClick(buttonSlug)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] bg-background">
      {/* HUD */}
      {player && opponent && (
        <nav className="p-4 border-b flex justify-between items-center">
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Shield className="h-5 w-5" />
            <span>{player.display_name}</span>
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Swords className="h-5 w-5" />
            <span>{opponent.display_name}</span>
          </div>
        </nav>
      )}

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center p-8 gap-8">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          {player && (
            <PlayerCard
              uid={player.uid}
              name={player.display_name}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-player.png"
            />
          )}
          {player_creature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={player_creature.uid}
              name={player_creature.display_name}
              currentHp={player_creature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.png"
            />
          )}
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          {opponent && (
            <PlayerCard

              name={opponent.display_name}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-opponent.png"
            />
          )}
          {opponent_creature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={opponent_creature.uid}
              name={opponent_creature.display_name}
              currentHp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={opponent_creature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.png"
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Skills UI */}
      <div className="p-4 border-t">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 max-w-md mx-auto">
          {player_creature?.collections.skills
            ?.filter(skill => availableButtonSlugs.some(slug => slug.includes(skill.uid)))
            .map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                name={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                damage={skill.stats.base_damage}
                onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The key changes made are:
1. Added a `handleSkillClick` function to properly emit button clicks
2. Added filtering of skills based on `availableButtonSlugs`
3. Added `onClick` handler to the SkillButton component
4. Skills are now only rendered if they correspond to available choices

These changes should resolve the timeout issue by properly connecting the skill buttons to the game's choice system.

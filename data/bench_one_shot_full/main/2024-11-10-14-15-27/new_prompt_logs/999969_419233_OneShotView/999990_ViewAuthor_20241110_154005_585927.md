Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

  accuracy?: number
  children?: React.ReactNode
}

let SkillButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, SkillButtonProps>(
  ({ uid, name, description, damage, accuracy, children, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (

      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Use CSS Grid for the main layout, dividing into three main sections:
  - Top: HUD/Navigation bar
  - Middle: Battlefield (creatures facing each other)
  - Bottom: Action UI (skills/buttons)

2. Component Organization:
- Main container using grid layout (h-screen for full height)
- Battlefield section using flex layout for creature positioning
- Skills section using grid layout for button arrangement

3. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for safe data access
- Implement null checks for collections and entities

4. Styling Strategy:
- Use Tailwind classes for responsive layout
- Grid template rows: `grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]` for flexible middle section
- Flex layout for horizontal creature positioning
- Container constraints to maintain 16:9 aspect ratio

5. Custom Components Usage:
- CreatureCard for both player and opponent creatures
- SkillButton components for player's available skills
- PlayerCard for player/opponent identification

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    base_damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    opponent: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    opponent_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature, player, opponent } = props.data.entities

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] bg-background">
      {/* HUD */}
      <nav className="p-4 border-b flex justify-between items-center">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Shield className="h-5 w-5" />
          <span>{player?.display_name}</span>
        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Swords className="h-5 w-5" />
          <span>{opponent?.display_name}</span>
        </div>
      </nav>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center p-8 gap-8">
        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <PlayerCard
            uid={player?.uid || 'player'}
            name={player?.display_name || 'Player'}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-player.png"
          />
          {player_creature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={player_creature.uid}
              name={player_creature.display_name}
              currentHp={player_creature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.png"
            />
          )}
        </div>

        <div className="flex flex-col items-center gap-4">
          <PlayerCard
            uid={opponent?.uid || 'opponent'}
            name={opponent?.display_name || 'Opponent'}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-opponent.png"
          />
          {opponent_creature && (
            <CreatureCard
              uid={opponent_creature.uid}
              name={opponent_creature.display_name}
              currentHp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={opponent_creature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.png"
            />
          )}
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Skills UI */}
      <div className="p-4 border-t">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 max-w-md mx-auto">
          {player_creature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              name={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              damage={skill.stats.base_damage}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This implementation:
- Uses a grid layout for the main structure
- Implements all custom components as specified
- Handles null/undefined cases safely
- Maintains proper spacing and alignment
- Uses Tailwind for responsive design
- Includes placeholder images (you'll need to replace these with actual assets)
- Provides a clean, organized battle interface

The layout will automatically adjust to the container while maintaining proper spacing and alignment. The skills section is limited in width to prevent stretching on wide screens.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

This is incorrect - we should only render if uid exists.\n- Second usage: Uses fallback 'opponent' string when uid is undefined. This is incorrect - we should only render if uid exists.\n\n2. CreatureCard:\n- Both usages correctly pass the creature.uid from the data.\n- However, they're inside conditional renders which is good.\n\n3. SkillButton:\n- Correctly passes skill.uid from the data.\n- Inside a map of existing skills which is good.\n\nOther issues:\n- We should wrap PlayerCard renders in conditionals like we did with CreatureCard\n- We should ensure we only render components when we have valid UIDs\n- The nav section should also be conditional on player/opponent existence\n\nThe code needs to be modified to be more defensive with rendering custom components.",

}
```

Changes made:
1. Added conditional rendering around PlayerCard components
2. Added conditional rendering around the nav section
3. Added additional null check for skills collection
4. Added uid existence check in skills map
5. Removed all fallback string UIDs
6. Maintained all proper conditional rendering for CreatureCards

Now all custom components are only rendered when they have valid UIDs from the data, making the component safer and following the guidelines correctly.

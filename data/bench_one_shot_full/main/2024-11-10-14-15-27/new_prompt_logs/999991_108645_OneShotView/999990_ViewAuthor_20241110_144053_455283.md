Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

interface SkillButtonProps {
  uid: string
  name: string
  description: string
  stats: string
  onClick?: () => void
  disabled?: boolean
}

let SkillButton = ({
  uid,
  name,
  description,
  stats,
  onClick,
  disabled
}: SkillButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <HoverCard uid={`${uid}-hover`}>
      <HoverCardTrigger uid={`${uid}-trigger`} asChild>
        <Button
          uid={`${uid}-button`}
          variant="default"
          onClick={onClick}
          disabled={disabled}
          className="w-[200px]"
        >
          {name}
        </Button>
      </HoverCardTrigger>
      <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-content`} className="w-80">
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h4 className="text-sm font-semibold">{name}</h4>
          <p className="text-sm">{description}</p>
          <div className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
            {stats}
          </div>
        </div>
      </HoverCardContent>
    </HoverCard>
  )
}

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardContent,
} from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Card> {
  uid: string
  name: string
  imageUrl: string
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-[300px]", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
        <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>

        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"

interface CreatureCardProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {

}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, hp, maxHp, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <Card 
        ref={ref} 
        className={cn("w-[300px]", className)} 
        uid={uid}
        {...props}
      >
        <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
          <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
          <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
            <img 
              src={imageUrl}
              alt={name}
              className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
            />
            <div className="flex justify-between items-center">
              <span>HP:</span>
              <span>{hp}/{maxHp}</span>
            </div>
          </div>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Full-screen flex container (h-screen)
- Three main sections vertically:
  * HUD (nav bar) - small height at top
  * Battlefield - flex-grow middle section
  * UI Area - fixed height bottom section

2. Battlefield Layout:
- Horizontal flex container
- Two sides (left/right) for player/opponent creatures
- Each side will use CreatureCard component
- Centered labels above cards to indicate player/opponent

3. UI Area:
- Fixed height container at bottom
- Will contain SkillButton components in a grid layout
- Buttons will be rendered based on availableButtonSlugs

4. Styling Strategy:
- Using Tailwind classes for responsive layout
- Flex and Grid for positioning
- Padding/margin for spacing
- Container queries for responsive sizing

5. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for safety
- Null checks for rendering conditions

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    bot: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    bot_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature

  return (

This implementation:
- Uses a full-screen flex layout
- Implements all required sections (HUD, Battlefield, UI)
- Uses the custom components as specified
- Handles null/undefined data safely
- Uses Tailwind for responsive design
- Maintains proper typing for all data structures
- Includes icons from lucide-react for visual enhancement

The layout will be responsive and maintain proper spacing while fitting into a 16:9 container. The creature cards are positioned on opposite sides of the battlefield, and the skill buttons are arranged in a grid at the bottom.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

Remove imageUrl construction and use data from the model\n2. Add PlayerCard components for player/bot entities\n3. Add better null checking for skills\n4. Improve responsive layout",

```

Changes made:
1. Added PlayerCard components for both player and bot
2. Properly destructured entities at the start
3. Added null check for entire component
4. Made the skills grid more responsive with different column counts at breakpoints
5. Added null coalescing operator for skills map
6. Used consistent default image URLs (these should be provided by the system)
7. Improved spacing and layout with gap utilities
8. Properly typed all interfaces
9. Ensured all custom components receive their required uid props
10. Removed dynamic image URL construction

All custom components now receive their required UIDs from the actual data, and we're properly handling cases where data might be missing. The layout is also more responsive and properly structured.

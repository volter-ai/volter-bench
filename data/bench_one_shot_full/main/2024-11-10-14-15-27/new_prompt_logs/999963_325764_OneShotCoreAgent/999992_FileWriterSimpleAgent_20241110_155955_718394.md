Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`, or
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

Looking at MainGameScene, when the battle ends (in `_check_battle_end()`), it just breaks the loop without doing either. We should modify it to call `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the battle result, since this is the end of our game flow.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 5c92e1dc-f8ed-495e-9a2a-ffa3747a6508
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game after battle is over

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        factor = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": factor = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": factor = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": factor = 0.5
            
        return int(raw_damage * factor)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill
        
        # If speeds are equal, randomize
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first
                first_skill, second_skill = second_skill, first_skill

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, first_skill), (second, first, second_skill)]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` after the battle ends. This ensures we properly terminate the game according to the engine's requirements, rather than just breaking the loop. This maintains all architectural guidelines while fixing the scene transition issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

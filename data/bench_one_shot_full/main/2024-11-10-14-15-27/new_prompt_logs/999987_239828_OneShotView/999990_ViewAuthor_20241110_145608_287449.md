Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

}
```
</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# Main Game Scene Views

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be spread out horizontally, with one on the left and one on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available skills and buttons.
</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { HoverCard, HoverCardContent, HoverCardTrigger } from "@/components/ui/hover-card"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"

interface SkillButtonProps {
  uid: string
  name: string
  description: string
  stats: string
  onClick?: () => void
  disabled?: boolean
}

let SkillButton = ({
  uid,
  name,
  description,
  stats,
  onClick,
  disabled
}: SkillButtonProps) => {
  return (
    <HoverCard uid={`${uid}-hover`}>
      <HoverCardTrigger uid={`${uid}-trigger`} asChild>
        <Button
          uid={`${uid}-button`}
          variant="default"
          onClick={onClick}
          disabled={disabled}
        >
          {name}
        </Button>
      </HoverCardTrigger>
      <HoverCardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
        <div className="space-y-2">
          <h4 className="text-sm font-semibold">{name}</h4>
          <p className="text-sm">{description}</p>
          <div className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">{stats}</div>
        </div>
      </HoverCardContent>
    </HoverCard>
  )
}

SkillButton = withClickable(SkillButton)

export { SkillButton }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/player/player_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Player`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardContent,
} from "@/components/ui/card"

interface PlayerCardProps extends React.ComponentProps<typeof Card> {
  uid: string
  name: string
  imageUrl: string
}

let PlayerCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, PlayerCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => (
    <Card ref={ref} className={cn("w-[300px]", className)} uid={uid} {...props}>
      <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
        <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
        <img
          src={imageUrl}
          alt={name}
          className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
        />
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
)

PlayerCard.displayName = "PlayerCard"

PlayerCard = withClickable(PlayerCard)

export { PlayerCard }

```

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Creature`
import * as React from "react"
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils"
import withClickable from "@/lib/withClickable"
import {
  Card,
  CardContent,
  CardDescription,
  CardFooter,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
} from "@/components/ui/card"

interface CreatureCardProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> {
  uid: string
  name: string
  hp: number
  maxHp: number
  imageUrl: string
}

let CreatureCard = React.forwardRef<HTMLDivElement, CreatureCardProps>(
  ({ className, uid, name, hp, maxHp, imageUrl, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (
      <Card uid={`${uid}-card`} ref={ref} className={cn("w-[350px]", className)} {...props}>
        <CardHeader uid={`${uid}-header`}>
          <CardTitle uid={`${uid}-title`}>{name}</CardTitle>
          <CardDescription uid={`${uid}-description`}>HP: {hp}/{maxHp}</CardDescription>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent uid={`${uid}-content`}>
          <img
            src={imageUrl}
            alt={name}
            className="w-full h-[200px] object-cover rounded-md"
          />
        </CardContent>
        <CardFooter uid={`${uid}-footer`} className="flex justify-between">
        </CardFooter>
      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.


__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:
1. **Layout Structure**:
   - Main container (full viewport, 16:9 ratio)
   - Top HUD navigation bar
   - Middle battlefield section (flex container)
   - Bottom UI section for skills/buttons

2. **Component Organization**:
   - Use the provided custom components:
     - CreatureCard for both player and opponent creatures
     - PlayerCard for player/opponent info
     - SkillButton for skills display
   - Organize with Tailwind CSS grid/flex layouts

3. **Tailwind Styling Approach**:
   - Use `grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto]` for main vertical layout
   - `flex justify-between` for battlefield creature positioning
   - Responsive sizing with relative units
   - Container constraints with `max-w-screen-xl mx-auto`

4. **Data Handling**:
   - Create interfaces for Creature, Player, and Skill types
   - Use optional chaining for safe data access
   - Handle missing data gracefully

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Sword, Shield, User } from 'lucide-react';
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card";
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card";
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button";

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    damage: number;
  };
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    max_hp: number;
  };
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[];
  };
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player";
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[];
  };
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
    bot: Player;
    player_creature: Creature;
    bot_creature: Creature;
  };
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const playerCreature = props.data.entities.player_creature;
  const botCreature = props.data.entities.bot_creature;

  if (!playerCreature || !botCreature) {
    return <div className="text-center p-4">Loading game...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="w-full h-full aspect-video bg-background flex flex-col">

        </div>
        <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
          <Sword className="w-4 h-4" />
          <Shield className="w-4 h-4" />
        </div>
      </nav>

            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.png"
          />
          <span className="text-sm font-bold">Your Creature</span>

```

This implementation:
1. Creates proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Uses a responsive layout with Tailwind
3. Implements all required sections (HUD, battlefield, UI)
4. Uses the custom components as specified
5. Handles missing data gracefully
6. Maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio with `aspect-video`
7. Uses proper spacing and alignment
8. Includes placeholder images (you'll need to replace `/placeholder-creature.png` with actual image paths)

The layout is divided into three main sections vertically, with the battlefield taking the majority of the space. The creatures are positioned on opposite sides of the battlefield, and the skills are displayed in a flex-wrap container at the bottom.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

Changes made:
1. Added proper PlayerCard components in the HUD for both player and bot
2. Added proper image URL paths using prototype_id or fallback to default
3. Added proper className constraints for the PlayerCards in the HUD
4. Added optional chaining for skills collection mapping
5. Destructured entities at the start for cleaner code
6. Maintained all proper uid passing to custom components
7. Kept proper type checking with __type fields
8. Maintained responsive layout and aspect ratio
9. Removed unused User icon import
10. Added proper null checks for all required entities

Note: The image paths (/images/...) are assumed to exist in your public folder. You'll need to ensure these paths match your actual image asset structure.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and the error, there are a few key problems:
1. The UI simulator is timing out after 120s, suggesting it cannot interact with the buttons properly
2. The skills section at the bottom appears to be empty or not properly rendered
3. The creature cards are visible but the player's creature appears mirrored due to the scale-x-[-1] transform

The main issue seems to be that the skill buttons are not properly accessible for interaction, which is causing the timeout error in the UI simulator.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Remove the scale-x transformation of the player creature as it may interfere with click events
2. Add proper accessibility attributes to make buttons more interactive
3. Ensure the skills grid maintains a consistent height and is always visible
4. Add proper error boundaries and loading states
5. Ensure skill buttons are properly rendered even when no skills are available

Here's the implementation:

  const { player, opponent, player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities

  if (!player || !opponent || !player_creature || !opponent_creature) {

  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)) {
      emitButtonClick(skillUid)
    }
  }

  const availableSkills = player_creature.collections.skills
    .filter(skill => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid))

  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] gap-4 p-4 bg-background">

          {availableSkills.length > 0 ? (
            availableSkills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                name={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}

                onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))
          ) : (
            <div className="col-span-2 text-center text-muted-foreground">
              No available actions
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Removed the scale-x transformation that was flipping the player creature
2. Added a loading state when data is not available
3. Extracted the skills filtering logic for better readability
4. Added a fallback message when no skills are available
5. Improved the layout structure and spacing
6. Added proper font weights to creature names for better visibility

These changes should make the UI more stable and interactive, resolving the timeout issues in the UI simulator.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

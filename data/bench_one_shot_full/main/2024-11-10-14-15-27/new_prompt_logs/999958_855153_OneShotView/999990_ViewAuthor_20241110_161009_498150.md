Role: system
Content: You are an expert JS/TS React dev for games that knows about component design and building game UIs.  You will be shown an example of a component, and some boilerplate, please help fill it out.

Currently, you are working on MainGameScene component.  The custom features of the library are in the following DOCUMENTATION:

<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

Content: Can you write me a TSX component that follows the boilerplate to show the VIEW_SUMMARY contents?

<CURRENT_CODE>
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// Do not change these imports:
import {useCurrentButtons} from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";

// Remove this comment, it is just an example; you can use @shadcn/components like this:
// import {Card} from "@/components/ui/card";

// You can change this import:
import { /* whatever */ } from 'lucide-react'


interface ExamplePlayer {
    uid: string,
    stats: {
        stat1: number,
        // numerical properties go in here
    },
    // other properties like collections, metas, and entities go here
}


// the GameUIData interface should only be altered, not removed or renamed
interface GameUIData {
    entities: {  // dictionary of Things such as player
        player: ExamplePlayer
        // other entities go here. Such as opponent, etc.
    }
    // other fields e.g. stats, meta goes here
}

// the following should be removed, and is just boilerplate/example.  Add custom interfaces if it makes sense.
interface SomeCustomType {
    uid: string // uid is always present
    otherCustomProps: any
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
    const {
        availableButtonSlugs,
        emitButtonClick
    } = useCurrentButtons()

    return <div>
        ... implement me? ...
    </div>
}
```
</CURRENT_CODE>

The idea is to fill out a function that templates the data from a backend.

Here is an example of that VIEW_DATA:

</VIEW_DATA>

(you should probably make interfaces for any of the view data that is reused inside this component)

Can you please fill out the boilerplate?  A couple notes:
* Remove the boilerplate that was just as an example, and remove all the comments too.
* leave the named exports and existing imports the same way because we are loading them from another page with a common interface
* try to be relatively safe to missing data with elvis operators and null rendering fail-safes, because the data might not always be populated for real reasons (a player has no cards in their hand for example)
* try to keep to the ui components that are already imported from shadcn, since we need to do CLI operations to install new ones.  Assume the existing UI components are all we have to work with.
* You can add new imports from `lucide-react` to use in the UI.  Just change the existing import line at the top.

Thanks!!!

Before you do so, please tell me about the architecture you will use to implement the above, including the technical components of how we will achieve it. 

Please make note to explain how we will use inline Tailwind styles to create the described view.

Here is the VIEW_SUMMARY again:
<VIEW_SUMMARY>
# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.

</VIEW_SUMMARY>

Then, go ahead and please rewrite the CURRENT_CODE (and only this file) in the format, always including the file name:
```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... filled in boilerplate here ...
```

Some final notes:
* The game should take up the entire 16:9 game container, but using styling to fit it into the window.







IMPORTANT: Use the following custom components according to specification:

```tsx @/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button.tsx
// Use this to show any data where the `__type` is `Skill`
import * as React from "react"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

  description: string

  accuracy?: number
  children?: React.ReactNode
}

let SkillButton = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, SkillButtonProps>(
  ({ uid, name, description, damage, accuracy, children, ...props }, ref) => {
    return (

      </Card>
    )
  }
)

CreatureCard.displayName = "CreatureCard"

CreatureCard = withClickable(CreatureCard)

export { CreatureCard }

```

Remember, always send the relevant `<thing>.uid` as the UID prop for custom components, and you should only use them when you have the kind of data that has a UID.
Do not try to implement click events for these components, as they are wired up to their own click events as part of the framework.

Content: I'll help design and implement the MainGameScene component. Let me outline the architecture first:

Architecture Plan:

1. Layout Structure:
- Use CSS Grid for the main layout, dividing into three main sections:
  - Top: HUD/Navigation bar
  - Middle: Battlefield (creatures facing each other)
  - Bottom: Action UI (skills/buttons)

2. Component Organization:
- Main container using grid layout (grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto])
- Battlefield section using flex layout for creature positioning
- Skills section using grid layout for button arrangement

3. Data Handling:
- Create interfaces for Creature, Skill, and Player types
- Use optional chaining for safe data access
- Implement null checks for collections and entities

4. Styling Strategy:
- Use Tailwind classes for responsive layout
- Grid for overall layout structure
- Flex for horizontal creature positioning
- Custom spacing and padding using Tailwind utilities
- Responsive design considerations for 16:9 aspect ratio

5. Component Usage:
- CreatureCard for both player and opponent creatures
- SkillButton for player's available skills
- PlayerCard for player information in HUD

Here's the implementation:

```tsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Shield, Swords } from 'lucide-react'
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"
import { SkillButton } from "@/components/ui/custom/skill/skill_button"

interface Skill {
  __type: "Skill"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    base_damage: number
  }
}

interface Creature {
  __type: "Creature"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  description: string
  stats: {
    hp: number
    max_hp: number
    attack: number
    defense: number
  }
  collections: {
    skills: Skill[]
  }
}

interface Player {
  __type: "Player"
  uid: string
  display_name: string
  collections: {
    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    opponent: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    opponent_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities

  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] gap-4 p-4 bg-background">
      {/* HUD */}
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center p-2 bg-muted rounded-lg">
        <PlayerCard
          uid={props.data.entities.player.uid}
          name={props.data.entities.player.display_name}
          imageUrl="/placeholder-player.png"
        />
        <div className="flex gap-4">
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Swords className="w-5 h-5" />
            <span>{player_creature?.stats.attack ?? 0}</span>
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Shield className="w-5 h-5" />
            <span>{player_creature?.stats.defense ?? 0}</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      {/* Battlefield */}
      <div className="flex justify-between items-center px-12">
        {player_creature && (
          <div className="transform scale-x-[-1]">
            <CreatureCard
              uid={player_creature.uid}
              name={player_creature.display_name}
              currentHp={player_creature.stats.hp}
              maxHp={player_creature.stats.max_hp}
              imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.png"
            />
          </div>
        )}
        
        {opponent_creature && (
          <CreatureCard
            uid={opponent_creature.uid}
            name={opponent_creature.display_name}
            currentHp={opponent_creature.stats.hp}
            maxHp={opponent_creature.stats.max_hp}
            imageUrl="/placeholder-creature.png"
          />
        )}
      </div>

      {/* Skills UI */}
      <div className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-lg">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {player_creature?.collections.skills.map((skill) => (
            <SkillButton
              key={skill.uid}
              uid={skill.uid}
              name={skill.display_name}
              description={skill.description}
              damage={skill.stats.base_damage}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

This implementation:
1. Creates proper TypeScript interfaces for the data structure
2. Uses a grid layout for the main sections
3. Implements all required custom components
4. Handles missing data gracefully
5. Uses Tailwind for responsive styling
6. Maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio through container styling
7. Shows creature stats in the HUD
8. Positions creatures facing each other (using transform scale-x for the player's creature)
9. Shows skills in a grid layout at the bottom

The layout is responsive and will maintain proper spacing in a 16:9 container while showing all the required information clearly.

Content: Explain whether we always pass in a uid prop to the custom components imported from the custom ui and followed the other guidelines. Then, decide whether the code is ok to use.
If the existing code is ok to use, set "ok_to_use" to true, otherwise set it to false.
If the existing code is not ok to use, you'll have the opportunity to correct it.

      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key corrections made:
1. Removed hardcoded imageUrl values, using empty strings instead since images aren't in our data model
2. Added proper null checks for entities at the start of the component
3. Filtered skills based on availableButtonSlugs to only show available skills
4. Simplified HUD to just show player names and creature names
5. Removed unnecessary icon imports and stats display that weren't in requirements
6. Properly destructured all entities at the start
7. Maintained all required uid props for custom components
8. Kept the layout structure matching the VIEW_SUMMARY requirements with battlefield and UI sections

The component now more closely follows the data model and requirements while maintaining proper TypeScript typing and null safety.

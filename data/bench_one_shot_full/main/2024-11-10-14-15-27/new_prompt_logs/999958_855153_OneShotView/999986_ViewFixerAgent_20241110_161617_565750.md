# MainGameSceneView

This is a document describing the main game scene of the pokemon-like creature battler game.

The screen is divided into two major areas; a battlefield, and buttons to interact that appear below in a user interface region.

The HUD should appear as a nav bar at the top of the screen.

## Battlefield Display

The battlefield shows:

- player creature - the player's creature, and their status (name, health)
- opponent creature - the opponent's creature, and their status (name, health)
- An indicator of which creature is the player's and which creature is the opponent's.
- The creatures should be placed across from each other, with the player's on the left and the opponent's on the right.

## User Interface

The lower half of the screen should be a text-box like area that switches between displaying text describing what is happening in the game and a series of buttons representing the player's available choices. The player can only see their own creature's skills, and not their opponent's.


Here is the current state of my file:

Can you please fix the following issue?
For context, the code has been run through a ui simulator that does monkey testing.
The script uses Puppeteer to run headless browser tests by randomly clicking within the game container's bounds, tracking successful interactions through a `window.gameEvents` object that maintains lists of available and completed choices, and can target specific scenes or run until a scene count is met. Here are the possible errors:

1. `"[ERROR-001] Choices list is empty..."` - No choices exist in `window.gameEvents.rawCurrentChoiceList` for 15s
2. `"[ERROR-001] Could not find or select the choices..."` - `rawCurrentChoiceList` has entries but random clicks aren't triggering `choices` updates for 15s
3. `"Remaining choices list is empty, but choices list is not empty..."` - Invalid game state where `remaining_choices` is empty but historical `choices` exist
4. `"Timeout after 120s"` - Overall test duration exceeded without completing intended flow


Detected Error - UI simulator appears to have failed:

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

First, thoroughly describe what is wrong with the scene. Not only should you reiterate the issue, but also describe what may be wrong with the image and how the image could be causing the issue with the scene.

Second, create a proposed solution to resolve the issue. Describe what code needs to be changed and how to make the change. Also explain why each change needs to be made.

Finally, implement the proposed solution and return to me the rewritten code.

Here are some considerations when diagnosing the problem:
- Is everything that we expect visible in the scene?
- If there are missing elements in the image, compare this with the provided code
  - If they exist in the code, consider how they might be hidden or pushed off-screen
- Are any elements unusually large?
  - Excessively large elements may cover other elements or push them off-screen

Here are some important considerations when making changes to the code:
- Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
- Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.  Do not use this on `@/components/ui/custom/` components.
- Do not emit thing uids from emitButtonClick.  Only emit the slug corresponding to the available button.

Please write out the complete file in the format (including the file path):

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
// ... entire file here ...
```

I've attached some images of the current component, rendered, for reference.

Please use the image to deduce what the problem is, create a proposed solution, and then implement it.
*Important*: Do not import new components unless the error is related to imports.
*Important*: Do not add unseen properties to any interfaces.
*Important*: Only emit available button slugs with emitButtonClick.
*Important*: All custom UI elements should receive a prop `uid` if they are imported from the custom UI directory.

Content: Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

**Issue Description:**
Looking at the image and the error, there are a few key problems:
1. The UI simulator is timing out after 120s, suggesting it cannot interact with the buttons properly
2. The skills section at the bottom appears to be empty or not properly rendered
3. The creature cards are visible but the player's creature appears mirrored due to the scale-x-[-1] transform

The main issue seems to be that the skill buttons are not properly accessible for interaction, which is causing the timeout error in the UI simulator.

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Remove the scale-x transformation of the player creature as it may interfere with click events
2. Add proper accessibility attributes to make buttons more interactive
3. Ensure the skills grid maintains a consistent height and is always visible
4. Add proper error boundaries and loading states
5. Ensure skill buttons are properly rendered even when no skills are available

Here's the implementation:

```jsx main_game/templates/MainGameScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { CreatureCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/creature/creature_card"
import { PlayerCard } from "@/components/ui/custom/player/player_card"

    creatures: Creature[]
  }
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player
    opponent: Player
    player_creature: Creature
    opponent_creature: Creature
  }
}

export function MainGameSceneView(props: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons()

  const { player, opponent, player_creature, opponent_creature } = props.data.entities

  if (!player || !opponent || !player_creature || !opponent_creature) {
    return <div className="h-full w-full flex items-center justify-center">Loading...</div>
  }

  const handleSkillClick = (skillUid: string) => {
    if (availableButtonSlugs.includes(skillUid)) {
      emitButtonClick(skillUid)
    }
  }

  const availableSkills = player_creature.collections.skills
    .filter(skill => availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid))

  return (
    <div className="h-full w-full grid grid-rows-[auto_1fr_auto] gap-4 p-4 bg-background">
      {/* HUD */}

      </div>

      {/* Skills UI */}
      <div className="bg-muted p-4 rounded-lg min-h-[120px]">
        <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
          {availableSkills.length > 0 ? (
            availableSkills.map((skill) => (
              <SkillButton
                key={skill.uid}
                uid={skill.uid}
                name={skill.display_name}
                description={skill.description}
                damage={skill.stats.base_damage}
                onClick={() => handleSkillClick(skill.uid)}
              />
            ))
          ) : (
            <div className="col-span-2 text-center text-muted-foreground">
              No available actions
            </div>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Key changes made:
1. Removed the scale-x transformation that was flipping the player creature
2. Added a loading state when data is not available
3. Extracted the skills filtering logic for better readability
4. Added a fallback message when no skills are available
5. Improved the layout structure and spacing
6. Added proper font weights to creature names for better visibility

These changes should make the UI more stable and interactive, resolving the timeout issues in the UI simulator.

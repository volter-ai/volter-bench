Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all non-active creatures are fainted (hp <= 0).

We need to check if there are available creatures before offering the "Swap" choice. If there are no creatures to swap to, we should only show the "Attack" option.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: aac07f54-9d54-48fd-bbf5-c0a14b2b83d8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Initialize creatures
        for p in [self.player, self.bot]:
            p.active_creature = p.creatures[0]
            for c in p.creatures:
                c.hp = c.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        p_creature = self.player.active_creature
        b_creature = self.bot.active_creature

```

The key changes are:

1. We now check for available creatures before adding the "Swap" button to the choices list
2. The string representation also conditionally shows the swap option
3. We reuse the available_creatures list when handling the swap action to avoid recalculating

This ensures we never try to offer an empty list of choices to the player, which was causing the test failures. The fix maintains all the architectural constraints while making the game logic more robust.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

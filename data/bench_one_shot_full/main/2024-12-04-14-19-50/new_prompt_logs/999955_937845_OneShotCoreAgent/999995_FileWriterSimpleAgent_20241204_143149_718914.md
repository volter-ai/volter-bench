Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to use Player objects (which inherit from AbstractThing) as dictionary keys in `self.queued_skills`. The engine specifically prevents AbstractThing objects from being used as hashable keys, requiring us to use their prototype_ids instead.

The fix:
Instead of storing the queued skills in a dictionary using Player objects as keys, we should:
1. Create a simple class structure to store the turn information
2. Keep track of both players' actions in separate variables
3. Use the player's uid (which is a string) if we absolutely need a dictionary key

The best solution is to simply store the queued skills in separate variables since we only have two players. This keeps the code simpler and avoids any hashing issues.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
            f"Dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the `queued_skills` dictionary
2. Added `player_queued_skill` and `opponent_queued_skill` instance variables
3. Simplified the turn resolution logic to work with the separate variables
4. Split out skill execution into its own method for cleaner code

This maintains all the same functionality while avoiding the hashing issue with AbstractThing objects.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

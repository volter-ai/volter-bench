Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the issues:

1. First error: `_wait_for_choice` called with empty choices list in `_get_swap_choice`. This happens when a player has no valid creatures to swap to (all creatures are either knocked out or active).

2. Second and third errors: `AttributeError: 'MainMenuScene' object has no attribute 'app'`. This is because we're trying to access `self.app` but the correct attribute from AbstractGameScene is `self._app`.

The main fixes needed:

1. In MainGameScene: Add validation before showing swap choices to prevent empty choice list
2. In MainMenuScene: Use `self._app` instead of `self.app` since that's the attribute name from AbstractGameScene
3. Move scene registration to App.__init__ only, not in scene constructors

Here's the fixed files:

        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Removed scene registration from MainMenuScene constructor
2. Added validation in MainGameScene._get_player_action to only show "Swap" option when valid creatures are available
3. This prevents the empty choices list error while maintaining the game logic

The rest of the files can remain unchanged since the issues were contained to these scene files.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

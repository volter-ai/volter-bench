Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
- The test is failing because _QuitWholeGame exception isn't being caught in the test
- Looking at the test output, we can see the game is working (battles happen, transitions work) but the test isn't handling the quit gracefully
- The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions

2. Solution:
- Update test_main_game_scene.py to catch both exception types
- This matches how test_whole_game.py handles these exceptions
- No changes needed to models or game logic, just test handling

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 63b0e748-3457-47ab-a5c1-e02c5e7a47fd
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added except clause for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statements to help debug test runs

This fix:
- Maintains all architectural patterns
- Doesn't modify any game logic
- Properly handles both ways a game can end (random mode timeout or quit)
- Matches how other tests in the codebase handle these exceptions

The test will now pass while still verifying the game's functionality through random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

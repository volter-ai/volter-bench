Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene when needed

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only define data structure.

2. Here are the files that need to be rewritten:

# Excerpt ID: d1a73a6c-5e91-4dd9-9428-a75cd521064c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature" 
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

# Excerpt ID: 9d766a95-685a-4fec-a672-253ff1d5ce44
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )
            
            # Bot phase
            self._show_text(self.bot, "Enemy turn!")
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skill(self.player_creature.skills[0], self.bot_creature)
            self._resolve_skill(self.bot_creature.skills[0], self.player_creature)

            # Check win condition
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _resolve_skill(self, skill, target):
        target.hp -= skill.damage
        if target.hp < 0:
            target.hp = 0
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the hp reset logic directly into MainGameScene's run() method
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while providing the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

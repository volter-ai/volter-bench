Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I see two issues that need fixing:

1. Missing uuid import in main.py
2. Incorrect scene initialization in MainMenuScene - we shouldn't register scenes in the scene constructor. Instead, all scenes should be registered in the App class.

The solution is to:
1. Add the uuid import to main.py
2. Remove the scene registration from MainMenuScene's __init__ and keep all scene registration in the App class

Here are the fixed files:

# Excerpt ID: 336afdf7-ebe9-4451-98ad-12a70d56e05a
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Register all scenes here, not in the individual scenes
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="basic_opponent")
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

# Excerpt ID: 2352d3c2-598a-466b-9049-b77ce8647edb
```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def __str__(self):
        return """=== Creature Battler ===
Welcome! Choose an option:
> Play
> Quit"""

    def run(self):
        play_button = Button("Play")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_button, quit_button])
        
        if choice == play_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added uuid import to main.py
2. Removed scene registration from MainMenuScene.__init__ since all scene registration should be done in the App class
3. Left the App class to handle all scene registration in its __init__ method

This maintains the proper architecture where:
- Scene registration is centralized in the App class
- Scenes focus on their game logic only
- The proper imports are in place

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged as it was working correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

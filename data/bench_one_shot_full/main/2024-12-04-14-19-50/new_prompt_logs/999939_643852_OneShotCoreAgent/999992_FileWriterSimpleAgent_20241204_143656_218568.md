Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where `_get_swap_choice` is being called with no available creatures to swap to. This happens when all non-active creatures are knocked out. We need to handle this case by not offering the "Swap" option when there are no valid creatures to swap to.

The fix should be in main_game_scene.py, specifically in the `_get_player_action` method. We should check if there are available creatures to swap to before offering the swap option.

Here's the complete fixed file:

            self.bot.active_creature = random.choice(available)
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. In `_get_player_action`, we now check if there are available creatures to swap to before showing the swap option
2. Only add the "Swap" button to choices if there are actually creatures available to swap to
3. Updated the __str__ method to indicate that swap is only available when possible

This ensures we never reach `_get_swap_choice` when there are no valid creatures to swap to, preventing the empty choices list error. The fix maintains the architecture and doesn't require any changes to the models or engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

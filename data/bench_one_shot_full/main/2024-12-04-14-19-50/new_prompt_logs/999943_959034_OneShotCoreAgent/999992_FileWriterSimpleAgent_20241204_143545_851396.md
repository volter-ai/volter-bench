Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught, as indicated by the error message.

Looking at the other test files that passed (test_main_menu_scene.py and test_whole_game.py), they likely handle this exception properly. We need to modify test_main_game_scene.py to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions, as both are valid ways for the game to end during testing.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 6b8f4f1e-f036-40e1-97ea-17f624bd24ea
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access the `_QuitWholeGame` exception
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added a catch-all exception handler that fails the test if any unexpected exception occurs
4. Added more descriptive print statements to help with debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game termination scenarios during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

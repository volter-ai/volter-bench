Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
Looking at the documentation in `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`, it states:
"When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

The current implementation resets HP at scene start, but it should be done when transitioning out. We can fix this by:
1. Moving the HP reset from __init__ to just before we transition back to MainMenuScene
2. This ensures creatures maintain their battle state during the scene but are reset before the next battle
3. We'll reset both player and bot creatures before transitioning

Here's the fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: 99d206ae-3b7d-4abb-8abf-ca3c7e7f5504
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolve turns
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
                
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creature states before transitioning out
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes:
1. Removed HP reset from __init__
2. Added HP reset just before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
3. This matches the documentation requirement exactly
4. Maintains pure data models without methods
5. Keeps all game logic in the scene

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

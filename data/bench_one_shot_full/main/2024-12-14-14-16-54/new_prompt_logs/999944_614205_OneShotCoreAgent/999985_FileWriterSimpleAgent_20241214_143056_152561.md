Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue occurs when a creature is knocked out and we try to execute its queued attack. Looking at the logs, specifically:

# Excerpt ID: 9368a754-c931-480a-b004-bacdc6b30d2e
```
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Scizard was knocked out!'}
StopIteration
```

The problem is that we're not properly handling the case where a creature gets knocked out during the first attack but still has a queued attack. According to the docs, when a creature is knocked out, the owner must swap to another creature, and that new creature gets hit by the opponent's queued attack. We're currently trying to execute the knocked-out creature's attack instead.

Solution:
1. Track which creature was active when the action was queued
2. If that creature gets knocked out, the new creature that gets swapped in should not execute the original creature's queued attack
3. The opponent's attack should still hit the newly swapped-in creature

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added original creature to action tuple in `_get_player_action`
2. Modified `_resolve_actions` to only execute second attack if the original creature that queued it is still active
3. This prevents the StopIteration error by not trying to execute attacks from knocked out creatures
4. Maintains game rules by still allowing the opponent's attack to hit newly swapped-in creatures

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
According to the documentation, when creatures have equal speed during the resolution phase, the order should be randomly determined with equal probability. Currently, the code always gives priority to the player when speeds are equal.

To fix this, we need to modify the `_resolve_actions` method in MainGameScene to use Python's random module to determine order when speeds are equal. The engine already imports random, so we can use it directly.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are in the `_resolve_actions` method:
1. Explicitly compare speeds to determine order
2. When speeds are equal, put both actors in a list and use random.shuffle() to randomly determine order
3. Execute attacks in the determined order

This implements the requirement that equal speeds should be resolved randomly with equal probability, while maintaining all other game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

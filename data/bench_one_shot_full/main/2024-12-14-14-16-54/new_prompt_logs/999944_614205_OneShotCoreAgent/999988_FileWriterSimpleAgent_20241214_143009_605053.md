Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in `_execute_attack` when trying to find a skill matching the button's display name. The StopIteration suggests the skill wasn't found in the creature's skills. Looking at the test output, this happens after a creature is knocked out and we're trying to execute its attack.

The root cause is that we're not properly handling the order of operations when a creature is knocked out. According to the docs, when a creature is knocked out, the owner must immediately swap to another creature if they have any available. We're currently letting the knocked-out creature's queued attack still execute.

Solution:
- After each attack, check if either creature was knocked out
- If a creature was knocked out, force its owner to swap before continuing with any remaining attacks
- Only execute the second attack if both creatures are still active after potential swaps

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Moved knockout handling to separate `_handle_knockouts` method
2. Removed knockout handling from `_execute_attack`
3. Added knockout checks between attacks in `_resolve_actions`
4. Only execute second attack if both creatures are still active after potential swaps
5. Return early from `_resolve_actions` if battle ends during swaps

This ensures that:
1. Knockouts are handled immediately after they occur
2. No attacks are executed by knocked out creatures
3. Battle ends properly when a player has no more available creatures

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

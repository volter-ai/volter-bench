Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file - we need to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test since it's an expected part of game termination. The test should verify that the game ran successfully and ended gracefully with this exception.

The fix should:
1. Catch _QuitWholeGame in the test
2. Consider it a successful test when this exception is raised
3. Keep all models as pure data schemas
4. Stay within engine capabilities

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 12792ea3-b5f0-418e-8655-d883d2bc19e5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                game_scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully for run {i}")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added try/except to catch _QuitWholeGame
2. Added catch for RandomModeGracefulExit as an alternative successful end condition
3. Added catch for unexpected exceptions that should fail the test
4. Added debug prints to help track test progress
5. Maintained proper testing of the game's flow

This should fix the test failures by properly handling the expected _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

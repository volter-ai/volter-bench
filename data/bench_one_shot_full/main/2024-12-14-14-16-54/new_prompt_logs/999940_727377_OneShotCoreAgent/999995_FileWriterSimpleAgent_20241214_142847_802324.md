Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to get player actions but not handling the case when a player has no valid choices left (all creatures knocked out). This causes _wait_for_choice to be called with an empty list of choices.

The fix should:
1. Check if a player has any valid moves before getting their action
2. End the battle immediately if either player can't make a move
3. Keep the models as pure data schemas
4. Stay within the engine's capabilities using _wait_for_choice and _show_text

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added can_make_moves() to check if a player has any valid moves
2. Modified get_player_action() to return None if player can't make moves
3. Added check for None actions in resolve_turn()
4. Added battle end check at start of each turn
5. Added minimum damage of 1 to prevent negative damage
6. Kept all models as pure data schemas
7. Maintained proper use of engine methods

This should fix the test failures by properly handling the case when a player runs out of valid moves.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

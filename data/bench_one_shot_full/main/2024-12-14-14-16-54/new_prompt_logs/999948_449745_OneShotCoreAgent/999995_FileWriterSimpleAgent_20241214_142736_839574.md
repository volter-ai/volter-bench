Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects. Looking at the engine code, SelectThing is a choice type that wraps a Thing, and we should check its `label` property instead of `display_name` when checking for the "Back" button.

The fix is straightforward - we need to modify the `_handle_turn` method in MainGameScene to properly handle the SelectThing choices and Button choices differently. When we get a choice back, we need to check if it's a Button (which has display_name) or a SelectThing (which has label).

Here's the fixed file:

                    player.active_creature = choice.thing
                    
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Created separate back_button variables to compare against directly
2. Changed the checks from `choice.display_name == "Back"` to `isinstance(choice, Button) and choice == back_button`
3. Kept the rest of the logic the same since it was working correctly

This fix properly handles both Button and SelectThing choice types while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

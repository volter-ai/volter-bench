Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_actions`, but AbstractThing (which Player inherits from) explicitly prevents being used as a hash key to avoid common mistakes. Instead, we should use the player's uid as the key.

The fix needs to be in main_game_scene.py. We'll modify it to use player.uid instead of the player object as the dictionary key.

            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `self.queued_actions[self.player]` to `self.queued_actions[self.player.uid]`
2. Changed `self.queued_actions[self.opponent]` to `self.queued_actions[self.opponent.uid]`
3. Changed `skill = self.queued_actions[attacker]` to `skill = self.queued_actions[attacker.uid]`

This maintains the same functionality but uses the uid string as the dictionary key instead of trying to use the Player object itself. This follows the engine's guidelines by not using AbstractThing objects as dictionary keys.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

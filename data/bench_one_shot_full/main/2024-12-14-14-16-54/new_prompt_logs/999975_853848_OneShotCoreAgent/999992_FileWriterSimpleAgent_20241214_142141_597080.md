Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The test is failing because we're getting into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. When testing MainGameScene directly, we need to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception just like we do in the main menu test.

The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. We need to:
1. Mock the transition method to prevent infinite scene transitions
2. Catch the _QuitWholeGame exception
3. Add assertions to verify the scene behaved correctly

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 91d83138-08fc-4979-9fd9-fbccf0174d7b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods to catch either exit path
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned as expected in run {i}")
                    assert mock_transition.called, "Scene should transition at end of battle"
                    assert mock_transition.call_args[0][0] == "MainMenuScene", "Should transition to main menu"
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game should quit cleanly"
                
                # Verify battle ended one way or another
                assert (mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called), \
                    "Scene should either transition or quit"

                # Reset mocks for next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()
                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This solution:
1. Properly mocks the transition method to prevent infinite recursion
2. Catches all possible exit conditions (transition, random mode exit, quit)
3. Adds assertions to verify correct behavior
4. Maintains the random testing approach
5. Stays within engine capabilities without modifying models or scene logic

The test now verifies that the MainGameScene either:
- Transitions to MainMenuScene after battle ends
- Exits due to random mode counter
- Exits via quit_whole_game

This matches the expected behavior while preventing infinite scene transitions during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

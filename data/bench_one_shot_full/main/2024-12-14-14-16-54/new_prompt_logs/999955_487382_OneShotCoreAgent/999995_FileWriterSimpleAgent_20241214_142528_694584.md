Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set the hp to max_hp in the scene
4. This maintains pure data models while keeping the same functionality

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Added `_reset_creature()` method to MainGameScene
3. Updated all reset calls to use the scene method instead
4. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while properly following the architecture requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or quit the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

In our case, when the battle ends (win or lose), we should transition back to the MainMenuScene. This maintains proper scene flow and allows players to play multiple battles or quit from the menu.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. When battle ends (in the run method), we now transition back to MainMenuScene after resetting creature HP
2. Added proper return statement after transition to prevent the scene from continuing
3. Kept all the same battle mechanics but ensured proper scene flow

This maintains the game loop where players can:
1. Start at main menu
2. Play a battle
3. Return to main menu after battle ends
4. Choose to play again or quit

The fix follows the engine architecture by using proper scene transitions and maintains the separation between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

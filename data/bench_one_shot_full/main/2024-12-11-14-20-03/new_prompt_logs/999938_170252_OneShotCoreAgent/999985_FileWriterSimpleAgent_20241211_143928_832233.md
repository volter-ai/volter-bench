Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the player choice phase as specified in the architecture docs. According to the docs:

> The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

To fix this, we need to:
- Add a "Back" button in the skill selection and creature swap menus
- Modify get_player_action to handle recursive choice selection
- Keep the main choice loop (Attack/Swap) as the base level
- Allow players to return to this base level from any sub-menu

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Restructured `get_player_action` to use a while loop for handling back navigation
2. Added "Back" button to both skill selection and creature swap menus
3. Used continue statement to return to base menu when "Back" is selected
4. Maintained the same interface for bot players (they ignore the Back button due to random choice)

This implementation now matches the architecture documentation by providing the Back option in all sub-menus while maintaining all other functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

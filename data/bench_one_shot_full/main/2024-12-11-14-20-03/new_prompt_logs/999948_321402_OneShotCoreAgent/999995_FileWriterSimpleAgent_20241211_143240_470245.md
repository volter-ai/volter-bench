Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being set in the JSON data. According to the error, even though we made it optional with `Creature | None`, the engine still requires it to be explicitly set.

The solution is to:
1. Add `active_creature` to the player prototypes in the JSON data
2. Set it to the first creature in each player's list
3. Keep the type hint as `Creature | None` since it's still conceptually optional

Here are the files that need to be updated:

# Excerpt ID: fe37cf51-72bf-4879-aada-4f7b93235246
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent", 
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

The models.py file doesn't need to change since the type hint is already correct. The engine will automatically convert the string "bubwool" into a Creature instance during deserialization because of the type hint.

This solution:
1. Stays within engine capabilities by using the JSON data to define initial state
2. Maintains pure data schemas in models.py
3. Properly uses the engine's automatic deserialization of prototype IDs to objects
4. Keeps the active_creature field optional in the type system while ensuring it has an initial value

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of properly ending the scene. According to the engine requirements, we must either:
- Transition to another scene (like back to main menu)
- Or quit the whole game

The best solution is to transition back to the MainMenuScene after showing the battle result, giving players a chance to play again or quit. This maintains proper scene flow and follows the engine's requirements.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 4dbf8996-3343-45e7-9935-630226876b52
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.opponent_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

            # Opponent choice phase
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Your turn!")
            self.opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self.determine_order()
            self.execute_turn(first)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu after battle ends
                return

            self.execute_turn(second)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu after battle ends
                return

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_choice), (self.opponent, self.opponent_choice)
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_choice), (self.player, self.player_choice)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, self.player_choice), (self.opponent, self.opponent_choice)
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_choice), (self.player, self.player_choice)

    def execute_turn(self, turn):
        attacker, skill_choice = turn
        if attacker == self.player:
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            attacker_creature = self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill_choice.thing.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp -= max(1, damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill_choice.thing.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends
2. Added `return` statements after the transitions to ensure clean scene exit
3. Removed the `break` statements that were causing the improper scene termination

This maintains the game flow while properly following the engine's scene transition requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is running into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, and when it eventually hits quit_whole_game(), the exception isn't caught.

The test needs to:
1. Catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
2. Mock both transition_to_scene and quit_whole_game to prevent infinite scene transitions
3. Follow the same pattern as the working main_menu_scene test

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 6b060467-4065-44de-9767-555477325b8f
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both exit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Mocked both transition_to_scene and quit_whole_game to prevent infinite recursion
3. Used the same TransitionFromScene pattern as the working main_menu_scene test
4. Added proper cleanup in the finally block

This maintains the architecture and engine capabilities while properly testing the scene's behavior. The test will now properly handle all ways the scene might exit, including transitions and game quits.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is a NameError because 'uuid' is not imported in main.py. This is a simple import issue that needs to be fixed in the main.py file. The error occurs in the create_bot method when trying to generate a unique ID.

The fix is straightforward - we just need to add the uuid import at the top of main.py. This won't affect any of the architectural patterns or model guidelines since it's just adding a required import.

2. Here's the complete fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: db0f89fb-c511-4d7d-8ed7-c5876598f518
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

This fix:
1. Maintains all architectural patterns
2. Doesn't modify any models
3. Keeps the separation of concerns
4. Just adds the missing import needed for the UUID generation
5. Should resolve the test failures while maintaining the engine's capabilities and constraints

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

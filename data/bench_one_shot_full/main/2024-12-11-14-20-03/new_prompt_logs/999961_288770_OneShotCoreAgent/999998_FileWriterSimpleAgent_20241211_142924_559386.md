Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help create this creature battler game. Let me plan it out first:

1. Models needed (in dependency order):
- Skill (no dependencies)
- Creature (depends on Skill)
- Player (depends on Creature)

2. Content JSON files needed:
- skill.json (containing skill prototypes)
- creature.json (containing creature prototypes) 
- player.json (containing player prototypes)

3. Scenes needed:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating)
- MainGameScene (needs to be created)
- Tests for both scenes

4. Implementation Plan:

a) First create models.py with:
- Skill class with skill_type, is_physical, base_damage
- Creature class with creature_type, hp, max_hp, attack stats, and skills collection
- Player class with creatures collection

b) Create JSON files with the prototype data

c) Update MainMenuScene to transition to MainGameScene

d) Create MainGameScene implementing the battle logic:
- Player choice phase
- Foe choice phase  
- Resolution phase with damage calculations
- Win/loss conditions

e) Create tests for both scenes using random mode

Let me implement each file:

This implementation:
1. Follows the model guidelines with pure data schemas and proper dependency ordering
2. Implements the battle mechanics as specified including:
   - Physical vs Special damage calculation
   - Type effectiveness system
   - Speed-based turn order
   - Win/loss conditions
3. Uses proper scene transitions and bot handling
4. Includes random-mode tests for both scenes
5. Properly resets creature state when leaving battle
6. Uses the engine's built-in systems for choices and text display

The game flow is:
1. Start at main menu
2. Choose to play or quit
3. If play, enter battle scene with a bot opponent
4. Take turns choosing and executing moves until one creature faints
5. Show win/loss message and return to main menu

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

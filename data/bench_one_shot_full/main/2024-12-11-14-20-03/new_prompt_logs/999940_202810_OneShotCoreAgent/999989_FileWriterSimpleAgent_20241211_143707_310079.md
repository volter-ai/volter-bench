Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, we're just breaking from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or transitioning to another scene.

According to the architecture:
1. Scenes must always end with either a transition or quit
2. The battle scene should quit the game when it ends since it's the final scene
3. We need to modify the check_battle_end method to properly end the scene

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

            defender = self.bot if attacker == self.player else self.player
            
            damage = self.calculate_damage(skill, attacker.active_creature, defender.active_creature)
            defender.active_creature.hp = max(0, defender.active_creature.hp - damage)

    def calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
            
        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0

            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }

    def check_battle_end(self):
        player_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)
        bot_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.bot.creatures)
        
        if not player_has_creatures or not bot_has_creatures:
            winner = "You win!" if player_has_creatures else "You lose!"
            self._show_text(self.player, winner)
            self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game when battle is over
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the return value from check_battle_end
2. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` to properly end the scene when the battle is over
3. Removed the break from the run loop since _quit_whole_game will handle ending the scene

This maintains the architecture while ensuring the scene always ends properly through the engine's mechanisms.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but getting an empty list. This happens because we're not properly checking if there are available creatures to swap to before presenting the choice.

The fix needs to:
1. Check if there are available creatures before offering the swap option
2. If no creatures are available for swapping, only show the attack option
3. Stay within the engine's capabilities by using the existing choice system

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method:
1. We check for available creatures before building the choice list
2. We only show the "Swap" option if there are actually creatures available to swap to
3. This ensures we never try to present an empty list of choices to `_wait_for_choice`

This maintains the architecture while fixing the test failures by ensuring valid choices are always available.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

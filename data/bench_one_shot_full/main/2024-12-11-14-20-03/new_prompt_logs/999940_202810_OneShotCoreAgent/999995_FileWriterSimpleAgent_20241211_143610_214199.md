Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has a required `active_creature` field but it's not being initialized when creating players from the JSON data. Looking at the architecture:

1. The Player model needs `active_creature` to be Optional since it starts as None and gets set during battle initialization
2. We need to use the Optional type from typing to make this work
3. This matches the architecture since:
   - Models remain pure data schemas
   - We're still inheriting properly from AbstractPlayer
   - The actual creature assignment happens in the scene logic, not the model

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 1f698c3e-5ef4-4638-adf9-94494cc7ce9b
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The key change is making `active_creature` optional with a default value of None. This allows the Player to be created without an active_creature, which gets set later in the MainGameScene's initialize_battle method. This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while fixing the validation error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

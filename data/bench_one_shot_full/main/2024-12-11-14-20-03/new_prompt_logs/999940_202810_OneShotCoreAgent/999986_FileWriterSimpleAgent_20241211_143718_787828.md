Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the architecture:

1. The _QuitWholeGame exception is expected and should be caught in tests
2. We should also catch RandomModeGracefulExit since we're using random mode
3. Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py that passes, we need to use similar exception handling patterns

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 8afb23a9-4d5f-4392-9ae9-799e97ea5d9d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully: {str(e)}")
                continue  # Continue to next iteration
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added continue statement to move to next test iteration after graceful exit
3. Added catch-all for unexpected exceptions to help with debugging
4. Added proper imports for the exceptions

This maintains the architecture while properly handling the expected game termination exceptions in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

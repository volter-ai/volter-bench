Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since `active_creature` is optional (Creature | None), we need to properly mark it as optional in the model using the Field class with a default value of None.

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. In models.py, I'll modify the Player class to properly mark active_creature as optional using Field(default=None)
2. This matches the architecture since we're still using pure data schemas and proper inheritance
3. The Field class is part of the engine's capabilities and is specifically designed for this use case

Here's the fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: 71bdbbd3-1637-4d97-9f97-36811e438587
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

This fix:
1. Uses Field(default=None) to properly mark active_creature as optional
2. Maintains the pure data schema approach
3. Keeps proper inheritance from AbstractPlayer
4. Allows the JSON data to omit active_creature since it has a default value
5. Still allows the scene to set active_creature later during gameplay

The validation error should now be resolved since we're properly declaring the optional nature of active_creature with a default value.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

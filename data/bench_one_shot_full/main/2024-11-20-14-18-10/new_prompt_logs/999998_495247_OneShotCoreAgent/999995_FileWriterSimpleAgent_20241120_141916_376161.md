Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead of having a reset method in the Creature model, we should:
1. Move all logic to scenes
2. Handle hp reset directly in the MainGameScene initialization
3. Simply set hp = max_hp in the scene code

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: b94f4f05-3b96-4b46-9a8e-d45a7e2951d3
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And the corresponding scene change (since the logic moved):

# Excerpt ID: 4d9ef32d-7ca2-4ecb-bb45-6d657925309e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.damage} damage" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle begins between {self.player.display_name} and {self.opponent.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_turn(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_turn(self, current_player, creature):
        skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, skill_choices)
        return creature.skills[skill_choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
        
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!\n"
            f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the hp reset logic directly into MainGameScene's __init__
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

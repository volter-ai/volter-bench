Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where we're using the player's skill choices for the bot, but the bot has different available skills. The bot is using Scizard which has Tackle and Fireball, while we're giving it choices based on Bubwool's skills (Tackle and Lick).

The fix is simple: we need to create separate choice lists for the player and bot based on their respective creatures' skills.

Here's the fixed scene file:

# Excerpt ID: dd5846c0-88ae-4c5c-a28d-62dd5f463d46
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender_creature.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender_creature.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender_creature.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0

            elif defender_creature.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)
        second_creature.hp = max(0, second_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        if second_creature.hp == 0:
            return

        # Second attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
        first_creature.hp = max(0, first_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_choices)

            # Bot choice phase
            bot_choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, bot_choices)

            # Get actual skills from choices
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)
            bot_skill = next(s for s in self.bot_creature.skills if s.display_name == bot_choice.display_name)

            # Determine order
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.bot_creature.speed:
                first = (self.player_creature, self.bot_creature, player_skill, bot_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.bot_creature.speed:
                first = (self.bot_creature, self.player_creature, bot_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, self.bot_creature, player_skill, bot_skill)
                else:
                    first = (self.bot_creature, self.player_creature, bot_skill, player_skill)

            self.execute_turn(*first)

            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
            elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now create separate choice lists for the player and bot based on their respective creatures' skills. This ensures that each participant can only choose from skills that their creature actually knows.

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged as it was working correctly. This fix maintains all the architectural guidelines while resolving the StopIteration error that occurred when trying to find bot skills in the wrong skill list.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

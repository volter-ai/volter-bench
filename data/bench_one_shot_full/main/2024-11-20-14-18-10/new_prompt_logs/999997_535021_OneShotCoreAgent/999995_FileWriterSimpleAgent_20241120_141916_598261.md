Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

Instead, I should:
- Remove the reset() method from Creature model
- Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene
- Keep Creature as a pure data model with just attributes
- Handle all state changes in the scene

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: d86bc143-0a90-4629-afd5-5bca05afaf78
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And the corresponding scene change:

# Excerpt ID: 34f5227d-f590-407c-a416-daa0d2d9f0c5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
VS
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle begins between {self.player.display_name} and {self.bot.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing

            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolve turns
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You won! {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted!")
                # Reset HP before transitioning
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You lost! Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted!")
                # Reset HP before transitioning
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Made Creature a pure data model with only attributes
3. Moved HP reset logic directly into the MainGameScene
4. Reset HP by directly setting hp = max_hp in the scene before transitioning

This maintains the pure data model requirement while preserving the game functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs during random testing. The test should catch this exception since it's an expected way for the game to end.

Looking at the error trace, we can see the game is working as intended - battles are happening, transitions are working, and eventually the quit game option is chosen. We just need to properly catch the quit exception in the test.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7fe32e7a-17ff-44b9-a709-0fa6330163bc
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception in run {i}: {e}")
```

The changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all handler to fail the test if any unexpected exceptions occur

This maintains the architecture while properly handling the expected game termination condition. The test will now pass while still verifying that the game scene works correctly through random testing.

The scene transitions (MainGameScene -> MainMenuScene -> MainGameScene) are working as intended, and the game eventually ends either through RandomModeGracefulExit or _QuitWholeGame, both of which are now properly handled by the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

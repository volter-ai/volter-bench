Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead, I should:
- Remove the reset() method from Creature model
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene
- Keep track of creature HP resets at the scene level
- The scene should set hp = max_hp for each creature when initializing

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: df0d05c4-b717-4ed1-a26e-4a0b85ac9806
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And the corresponding change in MainGameScene's initialization:

# Excerpt ID: 16f196f3-5a92-4b9b-ae56-47cb24c3cc74
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures by setting hp to max_hp
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
```

This maintains the pure data schema nature of the models while keeping the game logic in the scenes. The hp reset functionality is now handled directly in the scene's initialization rather than as a method on the Creature model.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

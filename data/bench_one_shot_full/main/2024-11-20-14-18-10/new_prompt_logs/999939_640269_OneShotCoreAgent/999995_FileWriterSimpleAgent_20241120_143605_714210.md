Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where `bot_action` can be None when trying to access `bot_action[0]`. This happens because `get_player_action()` can return None when a player chooses "Back", but the resolve_turn function doesn't handle this case.

The fix should:
- Check if either action is None before proceeding with resolution
- Return early if no valid actions exist
- Keep all game logic in scenes (not models)
- Maintain pure data schemas in models
- Stay within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed file:

```

Key changes:
1. Added safety check in resolve_turn to handle None actions
2. Made bot always attack if confused (prevents None bot_action)
3. Added early return in resolve_turn if either action is None
4. Kept all game logic in scene
5. Maintained pure data models
6. Used engine's existing capabilities

This should resolve the NoneType errors while maintaining the game's architecture and functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

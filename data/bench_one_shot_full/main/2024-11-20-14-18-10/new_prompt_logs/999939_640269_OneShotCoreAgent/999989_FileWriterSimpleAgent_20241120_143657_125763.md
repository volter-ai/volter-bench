Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the test file - we're not properly handling the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception in `test_main_game_scene.py`. The game is designed to raise this exception when quitting, and we need to catch it in our test just like we catch `RandomModeGracefulExit`.

The fix should:
- Catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` in the test
- Keep all game logic in scenes
- Maintain pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ce20aa6f-2d15-40bd-8f04-5b2a7c624ec0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully, ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` from engine lib
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added success message when game completes normally

This maintains the architecture while properly handling both ways the game can end:
- Random mode timeout (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- Normal game completion (_QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass while still verifying the game's functionality through random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The code needs two fixes to match the architecture:

a) Add "Back" option:
- In the player choice phase, when showing skills or swap options, we need to add a "Back" button
- When "Back" is chosen, we return to the main action choice (Attack/Swap)
- This requires restructuring the get_player_action method to handle recursive choice selection

b) Random speed tie resolution:
- When creatures have equal speed, we need to randomize the order
- Currently we just sort by speed, which doesn't handle ties randomly
- We'll modify resolve_turn to properly randomize equal-speed actions

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
2. Restructured get_player_action to use a while loop for handling "Back" choices
3. Completely rewrote resolve_turn to properly handle speed ties with randomization
4. Created speed_groups to group actions by speed before randomizing within groups
5. Maintained all other battle mechanics while adding these architectural requirements

The implementation now fully matches the documentation while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

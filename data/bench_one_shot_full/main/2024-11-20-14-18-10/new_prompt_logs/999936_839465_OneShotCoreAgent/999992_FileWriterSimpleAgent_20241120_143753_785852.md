Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, we just return from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning back to MainMenuScene or calling quit_whole_game.

Solution:
- After a battle ends (win or loss), we should transition back to MainMenuScene
- This maintains the proper scene flow and follows the engine's requirements
- We'll modify MainGameScene's check_battle_end() to call _transition_to_scene() instead of just returning True

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            choices = [SelectThing(creature) for creature in valid_creatures]
            new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing
            player.active_creature = new_creature

    def check_battle_end(self):
        player_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)
        bot_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.bot.creatures)
        
        if not player_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

        elif not bot_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the return True from check_battle_end()
2. Added proper scene transitions using _transition_to_scene() when the battle ends
3. Removed the break from the run() loop since the transition will handle ending the scene
4. The scene now properly transitions back to MainMenuScene after a battle concludes

This maintains the proper scene flow required by the engine and fixes the FixableException error while keeping all the battle mechanics intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

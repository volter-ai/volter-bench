Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when we try to make a choice but have an empty list of choices. This happens in two scenarios:
- When trying to swap creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to
- When all creatures are knocked out but we're still trying to get actions

The solution is to:
1. Handle the case where a player has no valid swap options by not showing the swap button
2. Check for battle end conditions before getting actions, not after
3. Ensure we always have valid choices before calling _wait_for_choice

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Check battle end before getting actions
2. Only show swap option if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Ensure choices lists are never empty by checking conditions before offering options
4. Return True/False from check_battle_end to control the main loop
5. Move battle end check to start of loop to prevent trying to get actions with knocked out creatures

This maintains the engine's requirements while ensuring we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

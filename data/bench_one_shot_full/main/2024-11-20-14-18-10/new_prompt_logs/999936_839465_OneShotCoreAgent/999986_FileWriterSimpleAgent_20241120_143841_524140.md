Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the expected QuitWholeGame exception that happens when transitioning back to MainMenuScene and then quitting.

According to the engine's architecture:
- When a battle ends, we transition to MainMenuScene
- In random mode, MainMenuScene will eventually choose "Quit"
- This raises QuitWholeGame which is expected and should be caught in the test
- We should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and QuitWholeGame in our test

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 97025949-12bc-4ea6-99d9-e41911eb1718
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all handler to fail the test if we get any unexpected exceptions
4. Added more descriptive print statements to help debug test runs

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game termination scenarios in our tests.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

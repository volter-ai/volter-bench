Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene returns directly when the game ends instead of properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end by either:
- Calling `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- Calling `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

The fix is simple - in MainGameScene, when a player wins, instead of just returning we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game session.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{current_player.display_name} sent out {swap.thing.display_name}!")
```

The key change is replacing the `return` statement with `self._quit_whole_game()` when a winner is determined. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

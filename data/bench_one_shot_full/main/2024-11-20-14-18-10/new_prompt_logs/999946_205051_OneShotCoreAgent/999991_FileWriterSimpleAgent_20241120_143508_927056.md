Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in MainGameScene where equal speed creatures should have their attack order determined randomly. According to the architecture doc:

"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The fix is straightforward - we'll modify the resolution phase in MainGameScene to add a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal. We can use Python's random.choice() to randomly select between the player and bot when their active creatures have equal speed.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{current_player.display_name} sent out {swap.thing.display_name}!")
```

The key changes are in the resolution phase where we:
1. Extract speeds into variables for clarity
2. Add an explicit equal-speed case that uses random.choice() to determine order
3. Keep the rest of the battle logic the same

This implementation now fully matches the architecture specification for speed-based turn order.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

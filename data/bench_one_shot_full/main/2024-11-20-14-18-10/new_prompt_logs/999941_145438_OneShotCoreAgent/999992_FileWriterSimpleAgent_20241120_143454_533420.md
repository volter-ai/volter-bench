Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that MainGameScene cannot be imported, which suggests there's a circular import problem. Looking at the files:
- main.py imports MainMenuScene
- MainMenuScene imports MainGameScene
- MainGameScene likely has some imports that create a cycle

Solution:
1. Remove the circular dependency by registering MainGameScene in main.py instead of MainMenuScene
2. MainMenuScene doesn't need to know about MainGameScene directly - it just needs to transition to it
3. This follows the architecture better since the App should be responsible for scene registration

2. Here are the fixed files:

# Excerpt ID: 722a9d6c-bce9-4fa1-888d-fccb18f5cc95
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

# Excerpt ID: 59c98ca0-2b39-477f-ad75-ecf1c8ce3f71
```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def __str__(self):
        return """=== Creature Battler ===
Welcome! Choose an option:

> Play
> Quit"""

    def run(self):
        play_button = Button("Play")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_button, quit_button])
        
        if choice == play_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This fixes the circular dependency by:
1. Moving scene registration to App
2. Removing the direct import of MainGameScene from MainMenuScene
3. Keeping the scene transition logic but using the scene name string instead

The rest of the files can remain unchanged since they weren't part of the circular dependency issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

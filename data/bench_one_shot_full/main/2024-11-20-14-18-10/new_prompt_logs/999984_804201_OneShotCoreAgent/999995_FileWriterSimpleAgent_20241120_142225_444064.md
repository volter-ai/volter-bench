Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because `_quit_whole_game()` is raising an exception that isn't being caught in the test. In the test, we should catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception just like we catch `RandomModeGracefulExit`. This is similar to how the main menu scene test handles graceful exits.

The fix is simple - we need to modify the test file to catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception. This matches the engine's design where quitting the game is a normal part of gameplay that raises a catchable exception.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 31fa4638-08f1-473d-bb04-9d62559cd22d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully via quit. Ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access the _QuitWholeGame exception
2. Adds a try/except block to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Maintains the engine's architecture where quitting is handled via exceptions
4. Keeps all models and scenes unchanged since this was just a test issue

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can end - either through the random mode counter reaching zero or through a normal game end condition.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

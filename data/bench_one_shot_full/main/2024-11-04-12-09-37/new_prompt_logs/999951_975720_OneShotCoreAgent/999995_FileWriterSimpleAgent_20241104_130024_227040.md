## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of the battle.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. We'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after displaying the battle result. This will ensure that the game loop continues and the scene exits in an expected manner.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. Add a method to display the battle result and transition to the MainMenuScene.
2. Modify the `run` method to call this new method after the battle ends.
3. Ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns True when the battle is over.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e255394a-d8a0-4529-b23f-dc5a0affbbd2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()

            first, second = self.determine_turn_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            first_skill, second_skill = (player_skill, opponent_skill) if first == self.player_creature else (opponent_skill, player_skill)

            self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.end_battle()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def determine_turn_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!"
        else:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!"

        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self.reset_creatures()

        # Add a button to return to the main menu
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        
        if choice == return_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle ends properly when either creature's HP reaches 0.
2. After the battle ends, a result message is shown to the player.
3. The player is given a choice to return to the main menu.
4. The scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle, ensuring that it exits in an expected manner.

This solution should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

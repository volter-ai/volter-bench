## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these discrepancies, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix the issues:

1. Implement random tie-breaking for equal speed during the resolution phase.
2. Add explicit prompting for forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.

These changes will align the implementation with the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the models as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

        super().__init__(app, player)

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. Random tie-breaking for equal speed: In the `_resolve_turn` method, we've modified the sorting key to include `random.random()` as a tie-breaker when speeds are equal.

2. Explicit prompting for forced swapping: We've added a new `_forced_swap` method that is called when a creature is knocked out. This method prompts the player to choose a new creature or automatically selects one if the player doesn't choose.

3. We've also modified the `_resolve_turn` method to check for knocked-out creatures after each action and trigger the forced swap if necessary.

These changes align the implementation with the architecture documentation while maintaining the structure of the models as pure data schemas and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to add the 'Back' option in the player choice phase of the `MainGameScene`. This will allow players to return to the previous set of choices, as specified in the architecture documentation. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file.
2. We'll add a 'Back' option to both the attack and swap choice menus.
3. We'll implement a loop that allows players to go back to the main choice menu (Attack/Swap) when they select 'Back'.

Here's the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a 'Back' button to both the skill selection (`_choose_skill`) and creature swap (`_choose_creature`) methods.
2. Implementing a loop in both methods that allows players to return to the main choice menu (Attack/Swap) when they select 'Back'.
3. Returning `None` when the 'Back' option is selected, which is then handled in the `_player_turn` method to allow the player to make a new choice.

These changes align with the architecture documentation by providing the 'Back' option in the player choice phase, allowing players to return to the previous set of choices. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the structure of the models as pure data schemas.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue of popping from an empty list in the `_resolve_turn` method, we need to ensure that the skill queues are never empty when we try to resolve a turn. The problem occurs because we're not checking if the player has chosen a skill before trying to resolve the turn. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to ensure that both the player and the opponent have chosen a skill before resolving the turn.
2. We'll introduce a new method `_ensure_skill_selected` that will be called for both the player and the opponent before resolving the turn.
3. We'll modify the `run` method to use this new method and only resolve the turn when both skills are selected.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: beba4404-aa29-4be5-880e-a6d4b0841fd1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.opponent_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._ensure_skill_selected(self.player, self.player_skill_queue)
            self._ensure_skill_selected(self.opponent, self.opponent_skill_queue)
            self._resolve_turn()

    def _ensure_skill_selected(self, actor, skill_queue):
        if not skill_queue:
            if actor == self.player:
                self._player_turn()
            else:
                self._opponent_turn()

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self.player_skill_queue.append(skill_choice.thing)
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        self.opponent_skill_queue.append(skill_choice.thing)

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        opponent_skill = self.opponent_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution introduces the `_ensure_skill_selected` method, which checks if a skill has been selected for the given actor (player or opponent). If no skill has been selected, it calls the appropriate turn method to select a skill.

The `run` method now calls `_ensure_skill_selected` for both the player and the opponent before resolving the turn. This ensures that both skill queues always have at least one skill before we try to resolve the turn, preventing the IndexError we were seeing before.

This change maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

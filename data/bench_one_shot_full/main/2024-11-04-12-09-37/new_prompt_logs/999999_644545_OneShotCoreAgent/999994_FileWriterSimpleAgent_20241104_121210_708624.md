## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creature state after a battle, we need to modify the MainGameScene. The reset should occur when transitioning out of this scene, as specified in the architecture documentation. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value.
2. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 94f11445-3a7e-4469-aba2-ab66c85557eb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if quit_button == choice:
                self._quit_whole_game()

            if use_skill_button == choice:
                skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
                skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
                self.apply_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            # Opponent turn
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_creature.skills[0]  # Simple AI: always use the first skill
            self.apply_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def apply_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds the `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. It's called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset after each battle, as required by the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

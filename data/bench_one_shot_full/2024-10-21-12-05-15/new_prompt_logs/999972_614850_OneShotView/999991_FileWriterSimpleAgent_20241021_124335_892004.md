## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll provide the corrected code for the MainMenuSceneView component, addressing the issues mentioned and ensuring we follow all the guidelines. Here's the updated code:

# Excerpt ID: 3b5ae174-09d4-46df-b8a6-27c350aab67c
```tsx main_game/templates/MainMenuScene.tsx
import { useCurrentButtons } from "@/lib/useChoices.ts";
import { Play, X } from 'lucide-react';
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

interface Player {
  uid: string;
  stats: Record<string, number>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  entities: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

interface GameUIData {
  entities: {
    player: Player;
  };
  stats: Record<string, any>;
  meta: Record<string, any>;
  collections: Record<string, any>;
  uid: string;
  display_name: string;
  description: string;
}

export function MainMenuSceneView({ data }: { data: GameUIData }) {
  const {
    availableButtonSlugs,
    emitButtonClick
  } = useCurrentButtons();

  const renderButtons = () => {
    return (
      <div className="flex flex-col space-y-4">
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('play') && (
          <Button
            variant="default"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('play')}
            className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 text-lg font-semibold"
          >
            <Play className="mr-2" size={24} />
            Play
          </Button>
        )}
        {availableButtonSlugs.includes('quit') && (
          <Button
            variant="destructive"
            onClick={() => emitButtonClick('quit')}
            className="flex items-center justify-center px-6 py-3 text-lg font-semibold"
          >
            <X className="mr-2" size={24} />
            Quit
          </Button>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  };

  return (
    <Card className="w-full h-full bg-gradient-to-b from-blue-900 to-blue-700 flex flex-col items-center justify-between p-8" style={{ aspectRatio: '16/9' }}>
      <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-white mt-16">
        {data.display_name || "Game Title"}
      </h1>
      <div className="mb-16">
        {renderButtons()}
      </div>
    </Card>
  );
}
```

This updated code addresses the previous issues and follows all the guidelines:

1. We've imported and used the `Button` and `Card` components from the shadcn UI library.
2. The main container is now a `Card` component, which provides a consistent look with other parts of the UI.
3. We've used the `Button` component from shadcn UI for the play and quit buttons, applying appropriate variants.
4. The `uid` prop is not explicitly passed to custom components because we're not using any custom components that require it. However, the `uid` is available in the `data` prop if needed for future use.
5. We've maintained the use of Tailwind classes for styling and layout.
6. The component still handles potential missing data with fallbacks.
7. We're using the `availableButtonSlugs` and `emitButtonClick` from the `useCurrentButtons` hook as required.
8. The layout maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio and takes up the full game container.

This implementation should now be compliant with all the guidelines and ready to use in the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
After analyzing the image and the provided code, I can identify the following issues:

1. The skill buttons are not visible in the UI, despite being present in the code.
2. The "Waiting for opponent's move..." message is displayed, which suggests that there are no available button slugs.
3. The image paths for players and creatures are likely incorrect, as they are not visible in the rendered view.

To resolve these issues, I propose the following solutions:

1. Modify the condition for displaying skill buttons to show them even when there are no available button slugs.
2. Update the image paths to use placeholder images or remove them if not available.
3. Ensure that the `emitButtonClick` function is called with the correct skill uid.

Here's the implemented solution:

              uid={skill.uid}
              skillName={skill.display_name}

              stats={`Damage: ${skill.stats.base_damage}`}
              onClick={() => emitButtonClick(skill.uid)}
              disabled={!availableButtonSlugs.includes(skill.uid)}
            />
          ))}
        </div>
        {availableButtonSlugs.length === 0 && (
          <p className="text-lg mt-4">Waiting for opponent's move...</p>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Changes made:

1. Removed the condition for displaying skill buttons, so they are always visible.
2. Removed the `imageUrl` props from `PlayerCard` and `CreatureCard` components, as they were likely causing issues and are not visible in the rendered view.
3. Moved the "Waiting for opponent's move..." message below the skill buttons and only display it when there are no available button slugs.
4. Kept the `emitButtonClick` function call with the skill's `uid`, as it's the correct way to emit the button click event.

These changes should resolve the timeout issue and ensure that the UI is displayed correctly, matching the design document and the rendered image.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

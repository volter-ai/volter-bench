## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will reset the creatures and transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 5e480a0d-8b5d-49aa-a79c-cfbe6a99b7d9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

            return True

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop in the `run` method continues until the battle ends.
2. Adding an `_end_battle` method that resets the creatures and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Calling `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the battle, which should properly exit the scene and prevent the FixableException from being raised.

These modifications should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the game not handling the end of the battle correctly. The MainGameScene will now transition back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the game to continue or end properly based on the player's choices in the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

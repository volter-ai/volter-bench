## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which is required by the engine. We'll update the `run` method to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the main menu or quit the game.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a player loses), we'll add a choice for the player to either return to the main menu or quit the game.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll call either `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` or `_quit_whole_game()`.
3. We'll also add a check to ensure that the game doesn't continue if all creatures of either player are knocked out.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly handling the end of the battle and providing the player with options to either return to the main menu or quit the game. The `end_battle` method is called when the battle ends, and it ensures that the scene always exits by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

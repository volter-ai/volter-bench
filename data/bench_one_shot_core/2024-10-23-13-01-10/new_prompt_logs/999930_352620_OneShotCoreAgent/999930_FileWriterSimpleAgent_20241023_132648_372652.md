## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. You're right that the speed-based turn order in the resolution phase was not implemented correctly. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated MainGameScene file.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement the speed-based turn order in the resolution phase, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

a. Instead of executing skills immediately in the player_turn and opponent_turn methods, we'll queue the chosen skills.
b. We'll create a new method called resolve_turn that will determine the order of skill execution based on the creatures' speed stats.
c. If the speeds are equal, we'll use random.choice to determine which creature goes first.
d. We'll execute the skills in the determined order.
e. We'll check for battle end conditions after each skill execution.

These changes will align the implementation with the architecture described in the documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing model structure.

2. Updated MainGameScene file:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene now correctly implements the speed-based turn order in the resolution phase, as specified in the architecture documents. The changes include:

1. Separating the skill selection (in player_turn and opponent_turn) from the skill execution.
2. Adding a resolve_turn method that determines the order of skill execution based on creature speeds.
3. Using a determine_turn_order method to decide which creature acts first, with a random choice in case of equal speeds.
4. Executing skills in the determined order and checking for battle end conditions after each execution.

These changes align the implementation with the specified requirements while maintaining the existing model structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a game loop in the MainGameScene that allows for multiple battles until the player chooses to quit.
3. We'll ensure that the scene properly exits by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: b7183b6b-73eb-464b-b33e-a39417fe198b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.reset_battle()

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.reset_battle()
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
            
            while True:
                # Player Choice Phase
                player_skill = self.player_turn()
                
                # Foe Choice Phase
                opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
                
                # Resolution Phase
                self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
                
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            
            # Ask if the player wants to play again or quit
            play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if quit_button == choice:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        
        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - opponent_skill.damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a main game loop that allows for multiple battles.
2. Resetting the battle state before each new battle.
3. Providing an option to play again or quit after each battle.
4. Ensuring that the scene exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the player chooses to quit.

This implementation should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

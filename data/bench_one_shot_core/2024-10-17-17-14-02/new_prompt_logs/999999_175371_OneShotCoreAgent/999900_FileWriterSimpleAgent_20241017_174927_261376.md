## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue where `_wait_for_choice` is called with no choices, we need to address the `get_swap_choice` method in the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures of a player are either the active creature or have zero HP, resulting in an empty list of choices.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `get_swap_choice` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list.
3. We'll update the `get_player_action` method to handle the case when `get_swap_choice` returns `None`.
4. We'll also add a check in the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to handle the case when no action is possible.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as this is a gameplay logic issue rather than a data structure problem.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying `get_swap_choice` to return `None` when there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. Updating `get_player_action` to handle the case when `get_swap_choice` returns `None`.
3. Modifying `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` to check if an action is possible and handle the case when no action can be taken.

These changes should resolve the `AssertionError` in the tests and allow the game to handle situations where a player has no available actions gracefully.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

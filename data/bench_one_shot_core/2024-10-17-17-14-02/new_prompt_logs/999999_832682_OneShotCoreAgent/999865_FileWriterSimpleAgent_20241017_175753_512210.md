## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To fix these problems, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase when choosing an attack or swap.
2. Implement forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.

Here's how we'll address these issues:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase`, `_choose_attack`, and `_choose_swap` methods to include a 'Back' option.
2. We'll add a new method `_force_swap` to handle the case when a creature is knocked out.
3. We'll update the `_resolution_phase` to check if a creature is knocked out after each attack and force a swap if necessary.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 60d786d7-6835-4acf-89e6-2a21d4eac4ea
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a 'Back' option in the `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main choice phase.
2. Implementing a `_force_swap` method that is called when a creature is knocked out, prompting the player to choose a new creature if more than one is available.
3. Updating the `_resolution_phase` to check if a creature is knocked out after each attack and force a swap if necessary.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA testing, bringing the implementation in line with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose solutions:

1. Handling equal speed:
   We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in `MainGameScene` to randomly decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.

2. Showing welcome message in MainMenuScene:
   We'll add a welcome message using `_show_text` at the beginning of the `run` method in `MainMenuScene`.

3. Removing enforced minimum damage:
   We'll remove the line that enforces a minimum damage of 1 in the `_execute_skill` method of `MainGameScene`.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Modify the `_resolution_phase` method to handle equal speed.
   - Remove the minimum damage enforcement in `_execute_skill`.

2. In `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Add a welcome message at the beginning of the `run` method.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with the proposed solutions:

                self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:
1. The `_resolution_phase` method now handles the case where creatures have equal speed by randomly deciding which one goes first.
2. The `MainMenuScene` now shows a welcome message using `_show_text` at the beginning of the `run` method.
3. The minimum damage enforcement has been removed from the `_execute_skill` method, allowing for 0 damage if the calculation results in a negative number.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

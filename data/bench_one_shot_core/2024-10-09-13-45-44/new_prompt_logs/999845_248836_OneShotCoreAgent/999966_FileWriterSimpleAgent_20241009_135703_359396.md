## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement a mechanism to ensure that swapped-in creatures get hit by the opponent's queued skill.
2. Add a method to reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.

Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. In the resolution phase, we'll keep track of the original active creatures and their chosen skills. When a swap occurs, we'll execute the opponent's skill against the newly swapped-in creature.
2. We'll add a `reset_creatures_state` method that will be called when transitioning away from the MainGameScene. This method will reset the HP of all creatures to their max HP and clear any chosen skills.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement these fixes:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Swapped-in creatures now get hit by the opponent's queued skill. We keep track of the original active creatures and their chosen skills, and execute the skills against the current active creatures (which may have been swapped in).

2. The player's creatures' state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene. We've added a `reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP and clears any chosen skills. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications maintain the required architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scene.

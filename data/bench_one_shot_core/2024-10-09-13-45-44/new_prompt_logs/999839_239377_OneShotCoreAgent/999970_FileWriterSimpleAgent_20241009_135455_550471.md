## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the `FixableException` that's being raised when trying to use a `Player` object as a dictionary key. This is happening because we're trying to use the `Player` object directly as a key in the `chosen_skills` dictionary. Instead, we should use the `prototype_id` of the player as the key.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to use the player's `prototype_id` as the key for the `chosen_skills` dictionary.
2. We'll update all references to `chosen_skills` to use the player's `prototype_id` instead of the player object itself.
3. We'll ensure that we're not modifying any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f369c5b6-16c3-4f69-a6c8-e08873d6002e

        self.chosen_skills = {}  # Dictionary to store chosen skills using player prototype_id as key
        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def resolution_phase(self):

        for player in players:

            chosen_action = self.chosen_skills.get(player.prototype_id)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.player.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.bot.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the `FixableException` by using the player's `prototype_id` as the key for the `chosen_skills` dictionary instead of the player object itself. This change ensures that we're not attempting to use an `AbstractThing` as a hashable ID, which was the root cause of the exception.

The changes maintain the integrity of the models as pure data schemas and stay within the capabilities of the engine. We've only modified the `MainGameScene` class, which is part of the game logic and not a model.

These changes should resolve the test failures and allow the game to run without raising the `FixableException`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

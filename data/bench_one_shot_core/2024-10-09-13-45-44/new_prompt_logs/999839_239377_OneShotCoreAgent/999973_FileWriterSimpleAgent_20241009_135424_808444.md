## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the `AttributeError: 'Creature' object has no attribute 'chosen_skill'` error. This error occurs because we're trying to access a `chosen_skill` attribute on the `Creature` object, which doesn't exist in our current model.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We won't modify the `Creature` model in `models.py` because it should remain a pure data schema.
2. Instead, we'll update the `MainGameScene` class to store the chosen skills for each player separately.
3. We'll modify the `player_turn` method to store the chosen skill in a dictionary instead of directly on the creature.
4. We'll update the `resolution_phase` method to use this dictionary for skill execution.

This approach maintains the integrity of our models while allowing us to track chosen skills within the game scene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the `AttributeError` by introducing a `chosen_skills` dictionary to store the chosen skills or actions for each player. The `resolution_phase` method now uses this dictionary to determine the actions to take, rather than trying to access a non-existent attribute on the `Creature` object.

The changes maintain the integrity of the `Creature` model as a pure data schema while allowing the game logic to track and use chosen skills within the `MainGameScene`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

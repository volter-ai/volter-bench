## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement explicit handling for draw conditions:
   - We'll add a turn counter to limit the number of turns in a battle.
   - If the turn limit is reached, we'll declare the battle a draw.

2. Prevent skill usage when a creature has 0 HP:
   - We'll modify the `player_turn` method to check if the active creature has 0 HP before allowing skill selection.
   - If the active creature has 0 HP, we'll force a swap.

3. Remove the creature state reset after battle:
   - We'll remove the `reset_creatures_state` method and its calls, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and don't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The modifications will be confined to the game logic within the `MainGameScene` class.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Draw conditions are now explicitly handled by introducing a turn counter and a maximum number of turns. If the maximum is reached, the battle ends in a draw.
2. Skill usage is now prevented when a creature has 0 HP. The `player_turn` method checks for this and forces a swap if necessary.
3. The creature state reset after battle has been removed, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and do not alter any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The changes are confined to the game logic within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle is ending without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
3. We'll call this method when the battle ends in the `run` method.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: fef18a5b-7896-4ac1-a2ce-759cdd68a2e1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `_end_battle` method that handles the end of the battle, shows the result, and transitions back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. Modifying the `run` method to call `_end_battle` when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.
3. Simplifying the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean value.

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly by transitioning to another scene, which should resolve the test failures and the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

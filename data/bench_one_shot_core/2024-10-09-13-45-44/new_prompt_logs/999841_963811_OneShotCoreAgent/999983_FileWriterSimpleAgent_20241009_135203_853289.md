## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Update the `get_type_factor` method to explicitly handle the 'Normal' type effectiveness.
2. Modify the `resolution_phase` method to handle the case when both creatures have 0 HP after a turn.
3. Remove the `reset_creatures` method and its call, as it wasn't explicitly mentioned in the architecture.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models will remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: d094f773-8ef1-47f9-b1c5-023264a85f98
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.game_loop()
        self._transition_to_main_menu()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

        # Handle the case when both creatures have 0 HP
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Both creatures fainted! It's a draw!")
            return True

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5},
            "normal": {}  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Both creatures fainted! It's a draw!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _transition_to_main_menu(self):
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. The `get_type_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'Normal' type by including it in the effectiveness dictionary with an empty sub-dictionary. This ensures that Normal type skills are neither effective nor ineffective against any type.

2. The `resolution_phase` method now checks if both creatures have 0 HP after executing skills. If so, it displays a "draw" message and returns True to end the battle.

3. The `check_battle_end` method now also checks for the case when both creatures have 0 or less HP, handling it as a draw.

4. The `reset_creatures` method and its call have been removed, as they weren't explicitly mentioned in the architecture.

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We can't add methods to the models as they should be pure data schemas. Instead, we'll modify the MainGameScene to handle the reset.

2. We'll add a reset_creatures method to the MainGameScene class that will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the foe.

3. We'll call this reset_creatures method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the battle.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: fce14c41-6b2b-4d0d-a3d7-12931f3bc645
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.foe_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.foe_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        foe_skill = self.foe_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This solution adds the `reset_creatures` method to the MainGameScene class. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the foe to their maximum HP. The method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the battle.

This approach maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas while handling the game logic within the scene. It also ensures that the state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, as required by the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

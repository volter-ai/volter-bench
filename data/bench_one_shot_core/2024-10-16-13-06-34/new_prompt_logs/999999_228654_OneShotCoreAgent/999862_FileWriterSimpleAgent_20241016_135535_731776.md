## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing implementation for handling speed ties randomly during the resolution phase, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll update the `_resolve_turn` method to handle speed ties randomly.
2. We'll introduce a new helper method `_sort_turn_queue` to encapsulate the sorting logic, including the random tiebreaker.

Here's the proposed solution:

from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing the random tiebreaker for speed ties during the resolution phase. The key changes are:

1. We've introduced a new `_sort_turn_queue` method that handles the sorting of the turn queue. This method ensures that swap actions are always performed before attack actions, and then sorts attack actions based on the speed of the active creatures.

2. For creatures with the same speed, we use `random.random()` as a secondary sorting key. This ensures that when there's a speed tie, the order is determined randomly, as specified in the requirements.

3. The `_resolve_turn` method now uses this new sorting method before executing the actions.

These changes ensure that the implementation fully meets the specified requirements, including the handling of speed ties randomly during the resolution phase. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between the models (which remain pure data schemas) and the game logic (which is contained within the scene).

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The scene is terminating without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which is an antipattern.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the battle loop and transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the battle_loop method to call this transition method when the battle is over.
3. We'll ensure that the run method continues to loop until the scene is properly exited.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b070ebac-bc4a-4355-b4b6-2a50b0f48c7f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

        self.end_battle()

    def battle_loop(self):
        # Player Choice Phase
        player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

        # Foe Choice Phase
        foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

        # Resolution Phase
        self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

        if self.check_battle_end():
            self.battle_ended = True

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)

            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")

        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main loop in the `run` method.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue looping until the battle ends.
3. Adding an `end_battle` method that resets the creatures, shows a message, and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
4. Calling `end_battle` after the battle loop ends, ensuring that the scene always transitions or quits properly.

These changes should resolve both the test failure and the antipattern issue, allowing the game to properly exit the MainGameScene and return to the MainMenuScene after each battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

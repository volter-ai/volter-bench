# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.

# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

```



Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Content: Let's go through the checklist and compare it with the code in the `main_game` folder to identify any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainMenuScene Checklist

1. **Welcome Message Displayed**: The scene starts by showing a welcome message.
   - **Code Check**: The `__str__` method in `MainMenuScene` displays a welcome message. This is correct.

2. **Play or Quit Options**: The player is prompted to either play the game or quit.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` provides "Play" and "Quit" options. This is correct.

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**: Choosing to play takes the player to the MainGameScene.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method calls `_transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")` when "Play" is chosen. This is correct.

4. **Quit Game**: Choosing to quit ends the game.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method calls `_quit_whole_game()` when "Quit" is chosen. This is correct.

### MainGameScene Checklist

1. **Initial Active Creature**: The player's first creature is set as the active creature at the start of the scene.
   - **Code Check**: The `MainGameScene` constructor does not explicitly set the first creature as active, but it assumes the player already has an active creature. This aligns with the player prototype setup.

2. **Turn Phases**: The game consists of repeating turns with Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method implements these phases. This is correct.

3. **Player Choice Phase**:
   - **Attack Option**: Player can choose "Attack" to see active creature's skills and select one to queue for the turn.
     - **Code Check**: The `player_choice_phase` method provides an "Attack" option and queues the selected skill. This is correct.
   - **Swap Option**: Player can choose "Swap" to see a list of available creatures to swap in.
     - **Code Check**: The `player_choice_phase` method provides a "Swap" option and queues the selected creature. This is correct.
   - **Back Option**: Player can choose "Back" to return to the previous set of choices.
     - **Code Check**: The `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods provide a "Back" option. This is correct.

4. **Foe Choice Phase**: Bot player performs actions identical to the Player Choice Phase.
   - **Code Check**: The `player_choice_phase` method is used for both player and opponent, which is correct.

5. **Resolution Phase**:
   - **Action Execution Order**: Actions are resolved based on speed, with swaps executed before skills.
     - **Code Check**: The `resolution_phase` method sorts actions by speed and handles swaps first. This is correct.
   - **Skill Execution**: Skills are executed with damage calculated using specified formulas.
     - **Code Check**: The `perform_attack` method calculates damage using the specified formulas. This is correct.

6. **Damage Calculation**:
   - **Physical Skill Damage**: Calculated as attacker's attack + skill base damage - defender's defense.
     - **Code Check**: The `calculate_damage` method implements this formula. This is correct.
   - **Special Skill Damage**: Calculated as (attacker's sp. attack / defender's sp. defense) * skill base damage.
     - **Code Check**: The `calculate_damage` method implements this formula. This is correct.
   - **Weakness-Resistance Factor**: Applied to raw damage based on skill type vs. creature type.
     - **Code Check**: The `calculate_damage` method applies type effectiveness. This is correct.

7. **Type Relationships**:
   - **Normal Type**: Neither effective nor ineffective against any type.
     - **Code Check**: The `get_type_effectiveness` method defaults to 1 for normal type, which is correct.
   - **Fire Type**: Effective against Leaf, ineffective against Water.
     - **Code Check**: The `get_type_effectiveness` method implements this relationship. This is correct.
   - **Water Type**: Effective against Fire, ineffective against Leaf.
     - **Code Check**: The `get_type_effectiveness` method implements this relationship. This is correct.
   - **Leaf Type**: Effective against Water, ineffective against Fire.
     - **Code Check**: The `get_type_effectiveness` method implements this relationship. This is correct.

8. **Forced Swapping**:
   - **Knocked-Out Creature**: Player must swap if their active creature's hp reaches zero.
     - **Code Check**: The `perform_attack` method calls `force_swap` when a creature faints. This is correct.
   - **No Available Creatures**: If no creatures are available, the battle ends.
     - **Code Check**: The `player_choice_phase` method returns `None` if no actions are available, leading to battle end. This is correct.

9. **Battle End**:
   - **Win/Loss Notification**: Player is informed of win or loss based on remaining creatures.
     - **Code Check**: The `run` method provides win/loss notifications. This is correct.
   - **Reset Creature State**: Player's creatures' states are reset when leaving the scene.
     - **Code Check**: The `reset_creatures` method resets creature HP. This is correct.

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to fix these issues. Here's how I plan to fix each problem:

1. Missing 'Back' option in Player Choice Phase:
   - Add a 'Back' button to the attack and swap choice menus.
   - Implement logic to return to the main choice menu when 'Back' is selected.

2. Missing explicit handling of speed-based execution order and random decision for same speed in Resolution Phase:
   - Implement a method to determine the order of actions based on creature speed.
   - Add a random decision when speeds are equal.

3. Missing reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the scene:
   - Add a method to reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp when transitioning to another scene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Added 'Back' options to both attack and swap choice menus.
2. Implemented speed-based execution order with random tiebreaker in the `resolve_actions` method.
3. Added `reset_creatures` method to restore all creatures' HP when leaving the scene.

The overall structure of the battle system has been improved to better reflect the described architecture, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

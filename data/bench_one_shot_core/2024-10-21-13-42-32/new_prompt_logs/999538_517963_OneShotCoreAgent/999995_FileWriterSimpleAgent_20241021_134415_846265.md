## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not properly handling the end of the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the game_loop method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a check to ensure that the game doesn't continue if either creature's HP drops to 0 or below during the resolution phase.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 32dda6aa-8ddb-479f-b37b-fd1f9b886e1c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            return

        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends in the game_loop method.
2. Checking if the foe's creature's HP drops to 0 or below immediately after the player's attack in the resolution_phase method, preventing the foe from attacking if they've already lost.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game properly handles the end of battles and transitions between scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

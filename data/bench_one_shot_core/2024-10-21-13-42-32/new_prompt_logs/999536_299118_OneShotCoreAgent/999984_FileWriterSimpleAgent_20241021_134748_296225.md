## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle, so they're ready for the next game.

3. We'll ensure that the scene properly exits by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` in all cases.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: d6582fc2-4f34-4a2e-a412-fa7604a5b360
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)

            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won the battle!")

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. Modifying the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
3. Ensuring that the scene always exits properly by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These modifications should resolve both the MainGameScene random run test failure and the whole game flow test failure. The scene will now properly exit when the battle ends, and the game flow will continue as expected.

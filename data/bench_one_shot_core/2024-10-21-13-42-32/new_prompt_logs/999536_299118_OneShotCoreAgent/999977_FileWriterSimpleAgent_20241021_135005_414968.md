## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError that occurs when trying to register the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene in the App class. The error suggests that these scene classes are not imported in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll import the necessary scene classes in the main.py file.
2. We'll also import the required classes from the engine library to ensure all dependencies are met.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 01f61cee-bb78-4d22-aa5b-c6231a4a7be9
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution imports the necessary scene classes (MainMenuScene and MainGameScene) from their respective modules. It also imports the required classes from the engine library (AbstractApp, HumanListener, and BotListener) and the Player model from the models file.

By importing these classes, we ensure that they are available when the App class is initialized, resolving the NameError we encountered earlier. This should allow the scenes to be registered correctly and the game to run without the previous error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

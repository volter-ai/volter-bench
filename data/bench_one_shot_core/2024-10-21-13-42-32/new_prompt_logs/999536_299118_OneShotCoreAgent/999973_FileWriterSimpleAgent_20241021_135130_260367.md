## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address each of the issues and then rewrite the MainGameScene file with the proposed solutions.

1. Describing the fixes:

a) To resolve equal speed scenarios randomly, we'll modify the _resolution_phase method to use random.random() when speeds are equal.

b) We'll ensure that all damage calculations use float values until the final damage is calculated, at which point we'll convert to an integer.

c) We'll add an explicit message for the losing player at the end of the battle.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now uses `random.random()` to resolve equal speed scenarios randomly.
2. All damage calculations in the `_execute_skill` method now use float values until the final damage is calculated.
3. An explicit message for both the winning and losing player has been added in the `_check_battle_end` method.

These modifications should bring the implementation in line with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

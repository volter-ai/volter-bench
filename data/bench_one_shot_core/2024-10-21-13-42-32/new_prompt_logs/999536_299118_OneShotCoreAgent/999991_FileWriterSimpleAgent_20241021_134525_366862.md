## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the handling of equal creature speeds during battle.

1. Description of the fix:
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of always giving priority to the player when speeds are equal, we'll implement a random decision mechanism. This change will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file.

The fix will involve:
a) Adding a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
b) If speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly decide which creature goes first.
c) Implement the skill execution based on this random decision.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models or overall architecture. It only modifies the battle logic within the `MainGameScene`.

2. Rewritten file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0f7e153e-4461-4602-a9a7-639e9796c16a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speeds, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_attacker, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation of the `MainGameScene` class now correctly handles the case of equal creature speeds by randomly deciding which creature goes first. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, maintaining consistency with the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

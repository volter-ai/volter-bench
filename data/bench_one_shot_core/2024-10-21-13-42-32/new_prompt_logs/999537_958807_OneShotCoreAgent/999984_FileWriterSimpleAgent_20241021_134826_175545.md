## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The whole game flow test is failing because the MainGameScene is not transitioning or quitting properly.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to break the loop when the battle ends and call the transition method.
3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: fc1d370f-9987-41f0-9f5b-7b5b74875231
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()
        
        self._end_battle()

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle has ended.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the battle loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating `_check_battle_end` to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
4. Adding an `_end_battle` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over.

These changes ensure that the scene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene` when the battle ends, which should resolve both the MainGameScene test failure and the whole game flow test failure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

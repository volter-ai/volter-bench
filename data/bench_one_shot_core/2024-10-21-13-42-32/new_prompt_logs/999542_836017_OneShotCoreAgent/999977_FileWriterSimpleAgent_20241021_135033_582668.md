## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Equal speed scenarios in skill execution order:
   We'll modify the resolution phase to randomly decide the order when speeds are equal.

2. Float calculations in damage calculation:
   We'll ensure that all damage calculations use floats until the final step.

3. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   We'll implement this feature in the resolution phase and after each skill execution.

Here's how we'll fix these issues in the MainGameScene:

```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. Equal speed scenarios are now handled by adding a random tiebreaker in the sorting key of the turn queue.
2. Float calculations are used throughout the damage calculation process, with the final damage being converted to an integer at the end.
3. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is now implemented. After each skill execution, we check if either player's active creature has fainted and force a swap if necessary.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as a pure data schema, while all the game logic is handled in the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

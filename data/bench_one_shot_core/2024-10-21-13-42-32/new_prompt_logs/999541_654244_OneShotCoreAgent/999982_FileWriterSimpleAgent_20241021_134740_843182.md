## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The random run test for `MainGameScene` is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and use this in the main game loop.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We won't need to modify any models, as they are already correct pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 442242a1-2d1e-431e-b8d5-34b25efe1ab8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)
        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], first[2], second[2])
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], second[2], first[2])

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, skill1, creature1), (self.opponent, skill2, creature2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, skill2, creature2), (self.player, skill1, creature1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, skill1, creature1), (self.opponent, skill2, creature2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, skill2, creature2), (self.player, skill1, creature1)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, attacker_creature, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve both issues:

1. The `MainGameScene` now properly exits by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. The random run test for `MainGameScene` should now pass because the scene will exit as expected.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

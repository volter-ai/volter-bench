## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError in the `_determine_order` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because `player_skill` and `foe_skill` are not defined in this method. We need to pass these skills as parameters to the `_determine_order` method.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Modify the `_determine_order` method to accept `player_skill` and `foe_skill` as parameters.
2. Update the call to `_determine_order` in the `_resolution_phase` method to pass these skills.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7c466a67-723c-4f9e-8872-6931e8a96940
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]

        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1])
        if self._check_battle_end():
            return
        self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1])

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, skill1), (self.opponent, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, skill2), (self.player, skill1)
        else:

        raw_damage = attacker.creatures[0].attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \

        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution should resolve the NameError and allow the game to run without errors. The `_determine_order` method now correctly receives and uses the `player_skill` and `foe_skill` parameters, which should fix the issue in both the `test_main_game_scene_random_run` and `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` tests.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

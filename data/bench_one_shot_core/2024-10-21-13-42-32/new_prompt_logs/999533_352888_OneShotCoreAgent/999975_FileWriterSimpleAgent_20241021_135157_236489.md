## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both problems and provide a solution that adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Special skill damage calculation:
I'll modify the damage calculation for special skills in the `_execute_skill` method of the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of division, we'll use multiplication as specified in the architecture.

b) Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
I'll implement a new method `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` in the `MainGameScene` class. This method will be called after each attack to check if the defending creature's HP has reached zero. If so, it will force the player to swap to another creature with non-zero HP, if available.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

```

These changes address both issues:

1. The special skill damage calculation now uses multiplication instead of division in the `_execute_skill` method.
2. A new method `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` has been implemented and is called after each attack in the `_execute_skill` method. This method checks if the defending creature's HP has reached zero and forces a swap if necessary.

The implementation now adheres to the described architecture and requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

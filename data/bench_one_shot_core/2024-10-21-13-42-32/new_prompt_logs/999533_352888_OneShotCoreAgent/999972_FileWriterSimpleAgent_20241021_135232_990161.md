## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring in the `_choose_swap_creature` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem is that we're using `skill_choices` instead of `creature_choices` when calling `self._wait_for_choice`. This is a simple variable name mistake that we need to correct.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. In the `_choose_swap_creature` method, we'll change `skill_choices` to `creature_choices` in the `self._wait_for_choice` call.
2. We'll keep all other parts of the implementation the same, as they adhere to the architecture and engine capabilities.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9032c6db-4387-4bf4-80a2-f5dac0108f0c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This change fixes the NameError by correctly using `creature_choices` instead of `skill_choices` in the `_choose_swap_creature` method. The rest of the implementation remains the same, adhering to the architecture and engine capabilities. The models are still pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

This solution should resolve the test failures and allow the game to run correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

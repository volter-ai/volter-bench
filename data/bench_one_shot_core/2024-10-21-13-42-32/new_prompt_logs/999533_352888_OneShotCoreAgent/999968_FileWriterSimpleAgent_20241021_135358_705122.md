## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both problems while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture.

1. To fix the issues:

a) Resolution of equal speeds:
We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use random.shuffle() when sorting the turn queue. This will ensure that creatures with equal speed are ordered randomly.

b) Explicit conversion from float to integer for final damage:
We'll modify the `_execute_skill` method to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the int() function.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 82689689-d47c-44b7-b1d4-743535344bcf

These changes address both issues:

1. The resolution of equal speeds is now implemented randomly by using `random.shuffle()` on the attack actions before sorting them by speed.
2. The conversion from float to integer for final damage is now explicit using the `int()` function.

The implementation adheres to the described architecture and requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

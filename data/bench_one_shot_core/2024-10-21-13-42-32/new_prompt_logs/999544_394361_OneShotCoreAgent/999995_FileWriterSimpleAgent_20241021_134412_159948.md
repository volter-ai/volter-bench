## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle is over.

2. The test_main_game_scene_random_run is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will reset the creatures and transition to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: db214f91-2a09-44d3-ab82-f0602e41bba1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.foe_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player Skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe Skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.player_skill_queue.append(selected_skill)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.foe_skill_queue.append(selected_skill)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        foe_skill = self.foe_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You lost! {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated.")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"You won! {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated.")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You won! {self.foe_creature.display_name} was defeated.")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"You lost! {self.foe_creature.display_name} was defeated.")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that resets the creatures and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
2. Calling `end_battle` when the battle ends in the `game_loop` method.
3. Ensuring that the scene always exits properly by transitioning to another scene.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flows correctly between scenes. The MainGameScene will now properly exit and return to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the game to continue or end as expected.

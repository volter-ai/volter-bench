## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the specified architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Equal speed resolution:
   We'll implement a random resolution for equal speed scenarios in the _resolution_phase method.

2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   We'll add a method to check for knocked-out creatures after each attack and force a swap if necessary.

3. Normal type neutrality:
   We'll explicitly handle the normal type in the _get_type_factor method.

4. Conversion of damage from float to integer:
   We'll ensure that the damage calculation explicitly converts the final damage to an integer.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file to address these issues:

# Excerpt ID: 96ddacee-ad3d-4799-b7b0-428ff82c8e56

```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. Equal speed resolution is now implemented randomly in the _resolution_phase method.
2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the _check_and_force_swap method, which is called after each attack.
3. Normal type neutrality is explicitly handled in the _get_type_factor method.
4. The conversion of damage from float to integer is explicitly done in the _calculate_damage method.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the described architecture while maintaining the core gameplay and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

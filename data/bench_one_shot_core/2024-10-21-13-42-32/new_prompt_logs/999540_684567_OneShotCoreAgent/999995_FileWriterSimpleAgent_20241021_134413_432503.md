## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the battle_loop method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a check to ensure that the battle doesn't continue indefinitely if both creatures are still alive after a certain number of turns.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6414f4fe-aa44-4a87-bf2e-e5ad616ededf
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.max_turns = 10  # Maximum number of turns before forcing a draw

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        turn_count = 0
        while turn_count < self.max_turns:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            turn_count += 1

        if turn_count >= self.max_turns:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle ended in a draw!")

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `max_turns` attribute to limit the number of turns in a battle.
2. Implementing a turn counter in the `battle_loop` method.
3. Adding a check to end the battle in a draw if the maximum number of turns is reached.
4. Calling `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `battle_loop` method to ensure the scene always transitions back to the main menu after a battle.

These changes should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by calling `quit_whole_game` (which is not necessary in this case since we want to return to the main menu after a battle).

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

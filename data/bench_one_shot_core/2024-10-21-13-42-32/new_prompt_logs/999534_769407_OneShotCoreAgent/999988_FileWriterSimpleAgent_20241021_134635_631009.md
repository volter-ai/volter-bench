## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a method to ask the player if they want to play again or quit after the battle ends.

3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, rather than returning from the method directly.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 06e45b8c-bcf7-4c02-946a-9251bf6be315
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to a new game or quitting the whole game. The `_ask_play_again` method gives the player the option to play another game or quit, which should resolve the test failures and make the game flow more robust.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for overlooking this important detail in the game mechanics. Let's address this issue and implement the correct behavior for equal creature speeds.

1. To fix the issue:
   - We'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class.
   - When the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - This change will ensure that when creatures have the same speed, the order is decided randomly with equal chance, as specified in the architecture.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2df30bc8-6b7d-4afd-9b85-afe673474ad7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
            self.battle_loop()
            
            play_again = self.ask_play_again()
            if not play_again:
                break

            # Reset creatures for a new battle
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.choose_skill(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.choose_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def choose_skill(self, actor: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(actor, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speeds, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_attacker, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def ask_play_again(self) -> bool:
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolve_turn` method to handle equal speeds correctly. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first, ensuring that the order is decided randomly with equal chance, as specified in the architecture.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class. This change aligns the implementation with the specified architecture and should resolve the discrepancy noted in the QA pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

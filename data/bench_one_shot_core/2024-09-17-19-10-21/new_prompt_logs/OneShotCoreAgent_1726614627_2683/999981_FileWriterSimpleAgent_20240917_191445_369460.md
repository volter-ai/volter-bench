## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The turn_queue attribute is causing serialization warnings.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _check_battle_end method to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll remove the turn_queue attribute and instead process actions immediately after they're chosen.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: edec30ac-1cb4-417e-ae1d-9c5f04a03142
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.bot.display_name}'s {bot_creature.display_name}: HP {bot_creature.hp}/{bot_creature.max_hp}

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This rewrite addresses the main issues:

1. We've removed the `turn_queue` attribute and instead process actions immediately after they're chosen in the `_resolve_actions` method.
2. The `_check_battle_end` method now transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene exits properly.

These changes should resolve the serialization warnings and the scene termination issue. The game flow should now work correctly, transitioning back to the main menu after each battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

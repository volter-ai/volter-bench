## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the `_resolve_actions` method of the `MainGameScene` class. We're trying to access a `speed` attribute on a `Skill` object, which doesn't exist. Instead, we should be using the speed of the creature using the skill. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `_resolve_actions` method to use the active creature's speed instead of trying to access a non-existent `speed` attribute on the `Skill` object.

2. We'll also adjust the logic to ensure that swap actions always happen before attack actions, regardless of speed.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: cb9da54c-b1ff-4842-8fad-6158b6002722
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Changing the `_resolve_actions` method to use the active creature's speed instead of trying to access a non-existent `speed` attribute on the `Skill` object.

2. Modifying the sorting logic to ensure that swap actions always happen before attack actions, and then sorting attack actions based on the speed of the active creature.

3. Keeping the rest of the game logic intact, ensuring that the game flow remains the same.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the game to run smoothly through the battle scenes. The tests should now pass without encountering the previous error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue. The current implementation is missing the 'Back' option in both the Attack and Swap choices in the MainGameScene, which doesn't align with the described architecture. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `choose_action`, `choose_skill`, and `choose_swap` methods in the `MainGameScene` class to include a 'Back' option.
2. We'll implement a recursive approach where selecting 'Back' will return the player to the previous choice level.
3. We'll ensure that the 'Back' option is not available at the top-level choice (Attack or Swap).

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models. It addresses the issue by providing the missing 'Back' functionality as described in the architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a 'Back' option in both the `choose_skill` and `choose_swap` methods.
2. Implementing a recursive approach where selecting 'Back' returns the player to the `choose_action` method.
3. Ensuring that the 'Back' option is not available at the top-level choice (Attack or Swap) in the `choose_action` method.

These changes align the implementation with the described architecture while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the engine's capabilities. The models remain unchanged, as the issue was in the scene logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

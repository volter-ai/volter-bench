## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the game ends.
2. The turn_queue attribute in MainGameScene is causing serialization warnings.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _check_battle_end method to call self._quit_whole_game() when the battle ends, ensuring proper scene termination.
2. We'll remove the turn_queue attribute from the MainGameScene class and instead use a local variable within the run method to manage the turn queue.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation between data models and game logic.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 205fb642-de97-40fa-b5c3-289465969e18
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._quit_whole_game()
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the main issues:

1. The `_check_battle_end` method now calls `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, ensuring proper scene termination.
2. The `turn_queue` is now a local variable within the `run` method, eliminating the serialization warnings.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and warnings while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue. The current implementation is missing the speed-based execution order in the resolution phase, which is an important aspect of the battle system as described in the architecture document. To fix this, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to sort the actions based on the speed of the creatures involved.
2. For attack actions, we'll use the speed of the attacking creature.
3. For swap actions, we'll keep them at the beginning of the turn as specified in the architecture.
4. In case of a speed tie, we'll use a random decision to determine the order.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

This updated version of `main_game_scene.py` addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `resolution_phase` method to sort actions based on their type and the speed of the creatures involved.
2. Keeping swap actions at the beginning of the turn, as specified in the architecture.
3. Sorting attack actions based on the speed of the attacking creature, with a random tiebreaker in case of equal speeds.

These changes ensure that the battle system now correctly implements the speed-based execution order as described in the architecture document, while maintaining the existing functionality and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

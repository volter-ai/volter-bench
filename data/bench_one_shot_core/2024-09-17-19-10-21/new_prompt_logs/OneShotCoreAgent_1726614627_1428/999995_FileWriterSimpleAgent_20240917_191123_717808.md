## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is happening because the battle end condition is not properly handled. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method of MainGameScene, instead of just returning True, we'll transition to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll remove the break statement from the run method, as it's no longer needed.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP at the start of each battle, ensuring that multiple battles can be played.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 40d545e8-a5d5-410b-82a6-9e3f5e05c399
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.reset_battle()

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                return  # This will allow the scene to exit properly

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} uses {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.foe_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, rather than terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The `reset_battle` method allows for multiple battles to be played by resetting the creatures' HP at the start of each battle.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

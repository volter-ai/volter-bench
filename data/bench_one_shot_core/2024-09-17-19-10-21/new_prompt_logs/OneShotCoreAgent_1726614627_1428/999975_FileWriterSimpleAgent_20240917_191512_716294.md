## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes on the MainGameScene, specifically the `turn_queue`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure it always ends with either a transition to another scene or by calling `quit_whole_game`.

2. We'll remove the `turn_queue` attribute from the MainGameScene class and instead use local variables within the methods that need it. This will resolve the serialization warnings.

3. We'll ensure that when the battle ends (either by winning or losing), we transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of just breaking the loop.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene:

This rewritten MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `run` method always ends with a transition to the MainMenuScene.
2. Removing the `turn_queue` as a class attribute and instead using it as a local variable within the `run` method.
3. Properly handling the end of the battle by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and the serialization warnings while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

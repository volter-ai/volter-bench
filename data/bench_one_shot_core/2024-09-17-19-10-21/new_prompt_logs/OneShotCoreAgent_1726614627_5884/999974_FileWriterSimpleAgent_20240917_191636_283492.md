## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue with the skill execution order based on the speed of the creatures in the resolution phase of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll sort the turn actions based on the speed of the creatures involved in the action.
2. For attack actions, we'll use the speed of the attacking creature.
3. For swap actions, we'll use the speed of the creature being swapped in.
4. We'll maintain the rule that swap actions always happen before attack actions.

Here's the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to sort the turn actions based on the speed of the creatures involved. The key changes are:

1. The `sort` function now uses a tuple as the key, where the first element determines whether it's a swap action (which always goes first), and the second element is the negative of the creature's speed (so that higher speeds go first).

2. For swap actions, we use the speed of the creature being swapped in.

3. For attack actions, we use the speed of the active creature of the player performing the attack.

This implementation ensures that:
- Swap actions always happen before attack actions.
- Among swap actions, the creature with the higher speed is swapped in first.
- Among attack actions, the creature with the higher speed attacks first.

The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models. It doesn't require any changes to the `models.py` file, as we're only modifying the game logic within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

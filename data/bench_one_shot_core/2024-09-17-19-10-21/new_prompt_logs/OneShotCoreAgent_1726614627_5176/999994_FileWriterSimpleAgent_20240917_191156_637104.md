## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the issue where the code doesn't handle equal speeds in the resolution phase, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal and, if so, randomly determine which creature goes first. This aligns with the requirement specified in the architecture documentation.

The fix will involve:
1. Importing the `random` module if it's not already imported.
2. Modifying the `resolution_phase` method to include a check for equal speeds.
3. Using `random.choice` to determine the order when speeds are equal.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture.

2. Updated file:

            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation of the `MainGameScene` class now correctly handles the case where the speeds of the creatures are equal in the resolution phase. The `resolution_phase` method has been modified to include a condition for equal speeds, and it uses `random.choice` to determine the order of skill execution when speeds are equal. This change aligns with the requirement specified in the architecture documentation and should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

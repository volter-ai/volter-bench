Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that after the battle ends, we transition to the MainMenuScene instead of just breaking the loop.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 7141a80a-a382-47ec-8dff-16090ceb2eab

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the game loop until the battle ends.
3. Adding a `_transition_to_main_menu` method that is called after the battle ends and creatures are reset.
4. Ensuring that the scene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle, rather than just ending.

These modifications should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the problem of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The game will now properly cycle between the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, allowing for multiple battles and providing a way to exit the game through the main menu.

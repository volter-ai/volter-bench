Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to implement the random execution order for skills when creatures have equal speed. Here's how we'll do it:

   - We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
   - We'll then execute the skills in the determined order.

   This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the existing architecture and models.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 639fe060-200f-43c6-9be2-ca1911a6ea9c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.handle_battle_end()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        # Ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated `MainGameScene` class now correctly implements the random execution order for skills when creatures have equal speed. The `resolution_phase` method has been modified to handle three cases:

1. When the player's creature is faster
2. When the opponent's creature is faster
3. When both creatures have equal speed

In the case of equal speed, we use `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first, ensuring that the battle mechanics align with the specified behavior in the architecture documentation.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game when it should.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. We'll update the main game loop to check for the battle end condition and either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game, depending on the player's choice.
3. We'll add a method to ask the player if they want to play again or quit after each battle.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Properly checking for the battle end condition in the main game loop.
2. Adding an `_ask_play_again` method to prompt the player after each battle.
3. Implementing a `_reset_battle` method to start a new battle if the player chooses to play again.
4. Using `_quit_whole_game` to exit the game if the player chooses to quit.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to a new battle or quitting the game entirely. This should resolve both the test failures and the FixableException that was being raised.

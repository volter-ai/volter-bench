Content: I understand the issue now. The problem is that the MainGameScene is ending without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. To fix this, we need to modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, or quit the game if the player chooses to do so.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a method to ask the player if they want to play again or quit after the battle ends.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
3. We'll modify the run method to include this new logic.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by adding an `end_game_choice` method that is called after the battle ends. This method gives the player the option to play again (which transitions back to the MainMenuScene) or quit the game. 

The `run` method has been modified to call `end_game_choice` after the battle ends and creatures are reset. This ensures that the scene always ends with either a transition to another scene or by quitting the game, which should resolve the FixableException we were seeing in the test.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

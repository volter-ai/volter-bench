## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add an option for the player to quit the game after the battle ends.

Here's the proposed solution:

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `_end_battle` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. In the `_end_battle` method, we give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. If the player chooses to play again, we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
4. If the player chooses to quit, we call `_quit_whole_game()`.

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve both the test failure in `test_main_game_scene.py` and the FixableException in `test_whole_game.py`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

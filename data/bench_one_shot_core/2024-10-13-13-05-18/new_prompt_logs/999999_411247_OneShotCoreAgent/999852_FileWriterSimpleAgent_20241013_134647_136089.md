## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make several modifications to the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the choice phases for both attack and swap actions.
2. Implement action order based on speed, prioritizing swaps over attacks.
3. Handle random action order for creatures with the same speed.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file, staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the current architecture. We won't need to modify the models, as they should remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. The 'Back' option is now available in both the attack and swap choice phases.
2. Action order is now based on speed, with swaps prioritized over attacks.
3. Random action order is implemented for creatures with the same speed.

The changes maintain the current architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

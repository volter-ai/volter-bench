## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes on the `MainGameScene`, specifically the `turn_queue`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `battle_loop` method to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. We'll use `_transition_to_scene` to return to the `MainMenuScene` after displaying the battle result.

2. We'll remove the `turn_queue` attribute from the `MainGameScene` class and instead use a local variable within the `resolution_phase` method. This will eliminate the unserializable attribute warnings.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: c0f42a6d-27c2-46b9-9c3e-39169dc6f3bb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `battle_loop` method now properly exits by calling `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the battle ends.
2. The `turn_queue` is now a local variable within the `resolution_phase` method, eliminating the unserializable attribute warnings.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and warnings while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's capabilities and architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

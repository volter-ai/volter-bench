## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing random decision-making when creatures have the same speed, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random tiebreaker when creatures have the same speed.
2. We'll use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random value for each action, which will be used as a tiebreaker.
3. We'll update the sorting key to include this random tiebreaker value.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing random decision-making when creatures have the same speed. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random tiebreaker value for each action. The sorting key in the `actions.sort()` call has been updated to use this random tiebreaker when creatures have the same speed.

The changes maintain the current architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, with all game logic contained within the scene class. This implementation should now fully align with the architecture documentation, including the random decision-making requirement for same-speed creatures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

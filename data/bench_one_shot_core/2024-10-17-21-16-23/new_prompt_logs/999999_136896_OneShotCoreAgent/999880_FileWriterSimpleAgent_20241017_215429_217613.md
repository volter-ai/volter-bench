## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `_wait_for_choice` method is being called with no choices in the `_choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene`.
2. The `MainGameScene` is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_choose_swap` method, we'll add a check to ensure there are available creatures to swap to. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.

2. In the `run` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll add a check after the battle ends to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` or quit the game.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 6022759f-d461-47f1-9d34-4c37bc0e2e99

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

        else:
            self._show_text(player, f"{player.display_name} has no more creatures able to battle!")
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `_choose_swap` method now checks if there are available creatures to swap to. If not, it returns `None`, and the `_player_choice_phase` method handles this by continuing the loop to allow the player to choose again.

2. After the battle ends (when `_check_battle_end` returns `True`), we now transition back to the `MainMenuScene` using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`. This ensures that the scene doesn't terminate without calling either `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the game's logic and adhering to the engine's architecture and capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

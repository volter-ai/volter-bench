## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in `MainGameScene` is not continuing after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `_end_battle` method in `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` instead of directly calling `_transition_to_scene`.
2. We'll update the `run` method to continue the game loop until a transition or quit occurs.
3. We'll add a check in the `_check_battle_end` method to return `True` only when the battle actually ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self.battle_ended = True
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. The main modifications are:

1. Added a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Updated the `run` method to continue the loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Modified the `_end_battle` method to set `battle_ended` to True and transition to the `MainMenuScene`.

These changes should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` properly exits either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The game loop will now continue until the battle ends, and then it will transition back to the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the random order logic for skill execution when creatures have the same speed. This was described in the architecture documentation but was not implemented in the current code. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_resolve_turns` method of the `MainGameScene` class, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills in the randomly determined order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models. It only affects the game logic in the `MainGameScene`.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9cde473f-a461-4a1f-8e1e-9d8725418750
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _opponent_turn(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turns(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first, second = random.choice([
                (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature, player_skill)

            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self, result_message):
        self._show_text(self.player, result_message)
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining which creature goes first in that situation. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, and this solution adheres to the engine's capabilities and the existing model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state upon exiting the Main Game Scene, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. The `_reset_creatures` method is already implemented, but it's not being called at the right time. We'll fix this by calling the method just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll call the `_reset_creatures` method just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll ensure that both the player's and the bot's creatures are reset.
3. We'll keep the `_reset_creatures` method as is, since it already handles both the player's and bot's creatures.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 5ea5e3ec-aec1-45f9-9fcf-95d42890f24e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        try:
            self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "A wild creature appears!")

            while True:
                # Player turn
                player_skill = self._player_turn()
                
                # Bot turn
                bot_skill = self._bot_turn()
                
                # Resolution phase
                self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
                
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    break

            # Short delay to show the battle result
            time.sleep(1)

            # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
            self._reset_creatures()

            # Transition back to the main menu
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # Handle the random testing scenario
            print("Random mode graceful exit in MainGameScene")
            # Ensure creatures are reset even in random mode
            self._reset_creatures()

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.bot_creature)
        self._apply_damage(self.bot, self.bot_creature, bot_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, target_creature):
        damage = skill.damage
        target_creature.hp = max(0, target_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{target_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation ensures that the creatures' state is reset before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. The `_reset_creatures` method is now called just before the transition, and it's also called in the `RandomModeGracefulExit` exception handler to ensure that creatures are reset even in random mode testing.

These changes align with the described architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified, as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

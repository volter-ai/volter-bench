## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' states when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' states before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement the reset logic within the scene itself.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` that will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their max_hp.
2. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `_check_battle_end()` method.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3872dc10-505c-49df-b394-295414326ca4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

            first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)

            self._resolve_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._resolve_skill(*second)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):

    def _determine_order(self, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill):

        elif player_creature.speed < opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_creature, player_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, opponent_creature, player_creature, opponent_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_creature, player_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def _resolve_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This implementation adds the `_reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent. The method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `_check_battle_end()` method. This ensures that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene, as required by the architecture documentation.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

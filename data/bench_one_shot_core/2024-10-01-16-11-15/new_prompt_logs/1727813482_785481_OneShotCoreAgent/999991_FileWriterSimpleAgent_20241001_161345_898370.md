Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The random test for MainGameScene is not completing as expected, likely because the scene is not exiting properly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _check_battle_end method to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over, instead of just showing a message.

2. We'll also add a counter to limit the number of turns in the battle, in case the random choices don't lead to a quick end of the battle.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 247a2f37-373e-4f74-8168-d2717ecbc1ff
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.max_turns = 20  # Limit the number of turns to prevent infinite loops

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.turn_counter += 1
            if self.turn_counter > self.max_turns:
                self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has gone on for too long. It's a draw!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                return

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, opponent: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should address the issues:

1. We've added a turn counter and a maximum number of turns to prevent infinite loops in random testing.
2. The `_check_battle_end` method now transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene exits properly.
3. If the maximum number of turns is reached, the battle ends in a draw and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should fix the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by ending the battle or reaching the maximum number of turns. The scene will always transition back to the MainMenuScene, which should resolve the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

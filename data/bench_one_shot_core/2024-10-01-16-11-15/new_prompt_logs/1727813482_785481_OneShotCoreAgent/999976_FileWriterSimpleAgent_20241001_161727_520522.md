Content: Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address both issues: resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, and removing the minimum damage enforcement.

1. To fix these issues, we'll make the following changes:

   a. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a method to reset the creatures' state before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
   
   b. We'll modify the _calculate_damage method to remove the minimum damage enforcement.

   c. We'll update the Player model to include a method for resetting creature states.

2. We need to modify two files: main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py and main_game/models.py. Here are the rewritten files with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: c9cd5317-77df-4ba5-9d9b-a6395c54bc09
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

In these modifications:

1. We've removed the minimum damage enforcement in the _calculate_damage method of MainGameScene.

2. We've added a _reset_creatures_state method to MainGameScene that calls the reset_creatures method on both the player and the opponent.

3. We've added a reset_creatures method to the Player model. This method resets the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.

4. We call _reset_creatures_state before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the _check_battle_end method.

These changes address both issues raised in the QA feedback while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines. The Player model remains a pure data schema, with the reset_creatures method simply updating the hp attribute of each creature.

Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions.

1. How to fix the issues:

a) Adding 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:
   - We'll add a 'Back' button to both the attack and swap choice menus.
   - When the 'Back' button is selected, we'll return to the main choice menu (Attack/Swap).

b) Handling equal speed scenarios in the Resolution Phase:
   - We'll modify the sorting of the turn order to include a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.
   - This will be done by adding a small random value to the speed when sorting.

c) Ensuring floats are used throughout damage calculation:
   - We'll explicitly use float values in all damage calculations.
   - The final damage will be converted to an integer only at the end of the calculation.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class, staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choice menus.
2. Equal speed scenarios are now handled by adding a small random value when sorting the turn order.
3. Float values are explicitly used throughout the damage calculation, with the final damage being converted to an integer only at the end.

The overall structure of the `MainGameScene` class remains the same, maintaining compatibility with the existing architecture and engine capabilities. The models are not affected by these changes, so they remain as pure data schemas inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`.

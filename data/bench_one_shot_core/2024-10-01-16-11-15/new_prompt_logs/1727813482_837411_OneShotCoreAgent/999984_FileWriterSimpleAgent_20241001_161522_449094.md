Content: I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. The error is occurring because there's a line of code at the module level in the `main_game_scene.py` file that's trying to use variables that aren't defined in that scope. Let's fix this issue.

1. Description of the fix:
We need to remove the erroneous line of code at the module level in the `main_game_scene.py` file. This line is causing the NameError when the module is imported. We'll ensure that all calculations are performed within the appropriate methods of the MainGameScene class.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c8861a9a-f85a-4036-9492-6998ba105618
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):

        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated version of the `main_game_scene.py` file removes the erroneous line that was causing the NameError. All calculations are now properly contained within the class methods, and there are no statements at the module level that could cause import errors.

This change should resolve the pytest failures and allow the tests to run without the NameError. The implementation still adheres to the model guidelines and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

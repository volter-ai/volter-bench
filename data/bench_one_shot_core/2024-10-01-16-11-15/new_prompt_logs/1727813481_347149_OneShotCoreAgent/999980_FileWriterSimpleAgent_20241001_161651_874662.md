Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The test for the full game flow is failing because the game is not properly ending.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the game_loop method to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. We'll do this by adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after displaying the battle result.

2. We'll also ensure that the check_battle_end method returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, which we'll use in the game_loop to determine when to transition.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: a76aac57-0fc4-4884-ae4c-539fc39f3843
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def get_skill_choices(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):

            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._show_text(self.player, "Battle has ended. Returning to main menu.")

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {damage} damage.")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The game_loop method now properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. The check_battle_end method is called after each turn and used to determine when to end the battle.
3. A message is shown to the player before transitioning back to the main menu.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing. The MainGameScene will now properly exit when the battle ends, and the full game flow test should pass as the game will correctly transition between scenes.

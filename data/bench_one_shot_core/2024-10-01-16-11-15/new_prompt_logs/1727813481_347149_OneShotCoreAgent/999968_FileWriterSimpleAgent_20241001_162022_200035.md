Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then rewrite the main_game_scene.py file to fix these issues. Here's how I plan to fix each problem:

1. Bot's choice in Foe Choice Phase: I'll implement a more comprehensive decision-making process for the bot, mirroring the player's choice structure.

2. Equal speed scenarios: I'll add a random tiebreaker when creatures have equal speed.

3. Conversion of damage from float to integer: I'll explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the int() function.

4. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero: I'll implement a method to handle forced swapping after each attack and at the start of each turn.

Now, I'll rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these fixes:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. The bot's choice now uses the same `get_player_action` method as the player, ensuring a more comprehensive decision-making process.
2. Equal speed scenarios are now handled with a random tiebreaker in the `resolution_phase` method.
3. The conversion of damage from float to integer is now explicit in the `execute_skill` method.
4. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the `check_and_force_swap` method, which is called after each attack and at the start of each turn.

These changes should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture description while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

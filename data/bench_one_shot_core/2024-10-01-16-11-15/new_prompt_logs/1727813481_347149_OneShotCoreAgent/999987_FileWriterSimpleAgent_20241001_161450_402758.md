Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Add the 'Leaf' type to the type relationships in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
2. Remove the 'Normal' type from the type relationships, as it's not mentioned in the architecture.

These changes will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to include the 'Leaf' type relationships.
2. Remove any references to the 'Normal' type.
3. Ensure that all type relationships mentioned in the architecture are correctly implemented.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: cb68fde0-57c6-446d-a064-a285ddb86ede
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

In this updated version of `main_game_scene.py`, we have:

1. Removed any references to the 'Normal' type, as it's not mentioned in the architecture.
2. Ensured that the 'Leaf' type is included in the type relationships in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
3. Kept the type relationships as mentioned in the architecture: Fire is effective against Leaf and ineffective against Water, Water is effective against Fire and ineffective against Leaf, and Leaf is effective against Water and ineffective against Fire.

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the provided architecture.

Content: Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the issues and rewrite the necessary files to fix these problems.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when creatures have equal speed:
      - In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the resolution_phase method to use random.choice when creatures have equal speed.

   b. Add display_name attribute to the Player model:
      - We'll update the Player class in models.py to include the display_name attribute.

   c. Explicitly define max_hp as an attribute in the Creature model:
      - We'll update the Creature class in models.py to include the max_hp attribute.

2. I'll rewrite the models.py and main_game_scene.py files to implement these fixes.

Here are the updated files:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The resolution_phase method now uses random.sample to determine the order of skill execution when creatures have equal speed.
2. The Player model now includes the display_name attribute.
3. The Creature model explicitly defines max_hp as an attribute.

The models remain pure data schemas without methods or properties, and they all inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer as required. The game logic is kept within the MainGameScene, maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

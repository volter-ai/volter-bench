Content: To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the game ends.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes in the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends (either when a player wins or loses).
2. We'll remove the `turn_actions` attribute from the MainGameScene class and instead use a local variable within the game loop method.

These changes will ensure that the scene properly exits and transitions, and removes the unserializable attribute warnings.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the main issues:

1. We've added a transition to the MainMenuScene at the end of the game_loop method, ensuring that the scene properly exits when the battle ends.
2. We've removed the `turn_actions` attribute from the class and instead use it as a local variable within the game_loop method. This eliminates the unserializable attribute warnings.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and warnings while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's architecture and capabilities.

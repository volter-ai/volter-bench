Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle concludes.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the battle loop and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will either transition to a new scene or quit the game.
2. We'll modify the battle_loop method to break out of the loop when the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the run method calls the appropriate transition or quit method after the battle loop ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 908b8f44-03d3-4ba6-b0fd-5e60d1dbb170
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.handle_battle_end()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        # You can customize this method to transition to different scenes based on the battle outcome
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Game Over!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Congratulations! You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Transition back to the main menu after winning
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method that decides what to do after the battle ends (either quit the game or transition to another scene).
2. Modifying the `run` method to call `handle_battle_end` after the battle loop finishes.
3. Ensuring that the battle loop breaks when `check_battle_end` returns True.
4. In `handle_battle_end`, we either quit the whole game (if the player loses) or transition back to the main menu (if the player wins).

These changes should resolve the issues of the scene not exiting properly and not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle concludes. The scene will now properly exit and either transition to the main menu or quit the game, depending on the battle outcome.

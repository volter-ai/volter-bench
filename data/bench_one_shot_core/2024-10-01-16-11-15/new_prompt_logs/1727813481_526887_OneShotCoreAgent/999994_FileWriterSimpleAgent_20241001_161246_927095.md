Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement an explicit queue for skills during the Resolution Phase:
   - Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class.
   - Modify the `player_choice_phase` method to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them.
   - Update the `resolution_phase` method to use skills from the queue.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - Add a `reset_creatures` method to reset HP of all creatures to their max_hp.
   - Call this method before transitioning to another scene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: f8e4bc6d-907d-4e46-80c2-70095f3e6041
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[tuple[Creature, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.skill_queue.clear()
            
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        chosen_skill = next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append((creature, chosen_skill))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        for creature, skill in self.skill_queue:
            if creature == self.player_creature:
                target = self.foe_creature
            else:
                target = self.player_creature
            
            target.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"{creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `skill_queue` is now explicitly managed during the game loop. Skills are added to the queue during the choice phases and then resolved in order during the resolution phase.

2. The `reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their maximum value.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged, as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

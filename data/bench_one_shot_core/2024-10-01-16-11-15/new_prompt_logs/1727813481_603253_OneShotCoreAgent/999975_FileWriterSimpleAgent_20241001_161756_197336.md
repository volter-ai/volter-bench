Content: I understand the issue and will address it by modifying the MainGameScene to implement random resolution for creatures with equal speed and handle forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Random resolution for equal speed:
   - In the _resolution_phase method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
   - We'll use random.random() to generate a random number between 0 and 1 for each action in the turn queue.

2. Forced swapping when HP reaches zero:
   - After each skill execution, we'll check if the defender's creature has zero HP.
   - If so, we'll implement a _force_swap method that will prompt the player to choose a new creature.
   - If the player has no more creatures with non-zero HP, we'll end the battle.

Here's the updated MainGameScene with these fixes implemented:

These changes address both issues:

1. Random resolution for equal speed: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include a random factor (`-x[3]`) when speeds are equal. This random factor is generated in the `_player_choice_phase` method when adding actions to the turn queue.

2. Forced swapping when HP reaches zero: We've added a `_force_swap` method that is called in the `_execute_skill` method when a creature's HP reaches zero. This method prompts the player to choose a new creature if they have any available, or ends the battle if they don't.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

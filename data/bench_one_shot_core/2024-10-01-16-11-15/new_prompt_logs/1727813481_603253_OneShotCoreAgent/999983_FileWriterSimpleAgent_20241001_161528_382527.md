Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Add a `max_hp` attribute to the Creature model in `models.py`.
2. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when creatures have equal speed in the Resolution Phase of the `MainGameScene`.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In `models.py`, I'll add the `max_hp` attribute to the Creature class.
2. In `main_game_scene.py`, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to use random.choice when the creatures have equal speed.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `Creature` model in `models.py` now explicitly includes the `max_hp` attribute.
2. The `resolution_phase` method in `MainGameScene` now implements random decision-making for skill execution order when creatures have equal speed.

The solution maintains the existing architecture and adheres to the guidelines for models and scenes. The `models.py` file keeps the classes as pure data schemas without methods or properties, and all models inherit from the appropriate abstract classes.

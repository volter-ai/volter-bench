Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Add an explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase:
   - Create a list to store the queued skills for both the player and the foe.
   - Modify the player_choice_phase and resolution_phase methods to use this queue.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - Add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp.
   - Call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: de485d34-a089-45b5-b1c9-be83dc03b627
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List, Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Skill, Creature, Creature]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature, self.foe_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature, self.player_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in attacker.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in attacker.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append((skill, attacker, defender))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        for skill, attacker, defender in self.skill_queue:
            defender.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self.skill_queue.clear()

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. An explicit queue (`self.skill_queue`) is now used to store the skills chosen by both the player and the foe. The `resolution_phase` method now processes this queue, ensuring that skills are resolved in the correct order.

2. A new `reset_creatures` method has been added, which resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the battle.

The implementation still adheres to the guidelines and architecture of the engine, and no changes were needed in the `models.py` file as the models remain pure data schemas.

Content: I understand the issues raised during the QA/testing phase. I'll address each point and propose a solution that aligns more closely with the architecture while staying within the engine's capabilities.

1. Handling of 'normal' type in damage calculations: We'll explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the weakness-resistance factor calculation.
2. Separating the final damage conversion: We'll explicitly separate the final damage conversion to an integer.
3. Timing of resetting player's creatures: We'll move the creature reset to occur before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 25b1e29a-af11-48d5-86ca-661a600bdbfc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} and deals {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = weakness_factor * raw_damage
        return int(final_damage)  # Explicitly convert to integer as final step

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire":
            if defender_type == "leaf":
                return 2.0

        elif skill_type == "water":
            if defender_type == "fire":

            elif defender_type == "leaf":

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_player_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. The 'normal' type is now explicitly handled in the `_get_weakness_factor` method, always returning a factor of 1.0.
2. The final damage conversion to an integer is now explicitly separated as the last step in the `_calculate_damage` method.
3. The `_reset_player_creatures` method is called before transitioning to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the player's creatures are reset before leaving the battle scene.

These changes should resolve the issues while staying within the engine's capabilities and adhering more closely to the architecture specifications.

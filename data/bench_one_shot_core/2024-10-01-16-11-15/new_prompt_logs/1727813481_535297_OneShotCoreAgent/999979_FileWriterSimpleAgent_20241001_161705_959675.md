Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To fix these problems, I'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Use float division instead of integer division in damage calculations to maintain precision.
2. Change the default weakness-resistance factor from 100 to 1, as per the architecture specifications.
3. Adjust the weakness-resistance factors to use floats (2.0 for double damage, 0.5 for half damage) instead of integers.
4. Round the final damage to the nearest integer after all calculations are done.

These changes will ensure that the damage calculation aligns with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Now, I'll rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ba7707dd-54eb-4800-9591-b95329fc9b20

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Float division is now used in the damage calculations to maintain precision.
2. The default weakness-resistance factor is set to 1.0 instead of 100.
3. Weakness-resistance factors now use floats (2.0 for double damage, 0.5 for half damage) instead of integers.
4. The final damage is rounded to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.

These modifications ensure that the damage calculation aligns with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The overall structure of the MainGameScene remains the same, maintaining consistency with the rest of the implementation.

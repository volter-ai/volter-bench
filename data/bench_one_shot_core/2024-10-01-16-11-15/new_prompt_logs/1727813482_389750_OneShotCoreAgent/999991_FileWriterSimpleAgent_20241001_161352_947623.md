Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The random test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll update the check_battle_end method to return True when the battle is over, and use this in the game loop to break and transition.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f41a574e-0f32-486e-b87f-783352e10de9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. The `game_loop` method now breaks and transitions to the MainMenuScene when `check_battle_end()` returns True.
2. The `check_battle_end` method now correctly returns True when the battle is over, which should allow the random test to exit the scene as expected.

These modifications should fix the failing tests and ensure that the game exits properly when a battle ends. The scene will transition back to the MainMenuScene, allowing the player to start a new game or quit.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is quitting the whole game after each battle, which is causing the test to fail after the first iteration.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Instead of quitting the whole game after a battle, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll keep the option for the player to play again or quit, but handle it within the scene's run method.
3. We'll use a loop in the run method to allow multiple battles without exiting the scene.
4. We'll only quit the whole game if the player explicitly chooses to do so.

This approach will allow the test to run multiple iterations of the `MainGameScene` without prematurely ending the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        return choice.display_name == "Play Again"
```

This solution makes the following changes:

1. The `run` method now has an outer loop that continues until the player chooses to go back to the main menu.
2. We've introduced a `_battle` method that handles a single battle.
3. After each battle, we call `_play_again_choice` to ask the player if they want to play again or go back to the main menu.
4. If the player chooses to go back to the main menu, we use `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` instead of quitting the whole game.

These changes should resolve the issue by allowing the test to run multiple iterations of the `MainGameScene` without prematurely ending the game. The scene will now properly transition back to the main menu when the player chooses to do so, rather than quitting the whole game after each battle.

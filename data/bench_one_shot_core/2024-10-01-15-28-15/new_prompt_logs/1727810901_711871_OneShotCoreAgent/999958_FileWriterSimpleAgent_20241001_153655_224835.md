Content: To fix the issues raised in the test output, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the transition to `MainMenuScene` is failing because `MainMenuScene` is not registered in the `TestApp` used for testing.
2. In the `MainMenuScene` test, the `_QuitWholeGame` exception is not being caught, causing the test to fail.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll update the `TestApp` class in both test files to register both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`.
2. We'll modify the test functions to catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models or the main game logic.

Let's rewrite the test files with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 5fb224ab-6d55-4445-b7fe-77c4000f0c90
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, AbstractGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        return self.create_player(prototype_id)  # For simplicity, create a player instead of a bot

    def transition_to_scene(self, scene_id: str, **kwargs):
        scene_factory = self.scene_registry[scene_id]
        scene = scene_factory(app=self, **kwargs)
        return scene

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        try:
            scene.run()
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            pass  # Expected exception, test passed
    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

# Excerpt ID: 674bc083-fdec-440a-a7a8-cfc6ddb43537
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, AbstractGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        return self.create_player(prototype_id)  # For simplicity, create a player instead of a bot

    def transition_to_scene(self, scene_id: str, **kwargs):
        scene_factory = self.scene_registry[scene_id]
        scene = scene_factory(app=self, **kwargs)
        return scene

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
        try:
            scene.run()
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            pass  # Expected exception, test passed
    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Registering both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` in the `TestApp` class, ensuring that transitions between scenes work correctly during testing.
2. Catching the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception in both test functions, which is the expected behavior when quitting the game.
3. Implementing a simple `transition_to_scene` method in `TestApp` to handle scene transitions during testing.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models and main game logic remain unchanged.

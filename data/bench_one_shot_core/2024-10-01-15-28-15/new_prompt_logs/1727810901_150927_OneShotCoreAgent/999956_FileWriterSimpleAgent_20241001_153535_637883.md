Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the test files to properly handle the RandomModeGracefulExit exception. The tests are failing because they're not catching this exception, which is raised when the random mode counter reaches zero.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception.
2. We'll import RandomModeGracefulExit from the engine's lib module.
3. We'll reset the HumanListener.random_mode_counter before each test run to ensure consistent behavior.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're simply adjusting how we handle the expected exception in our tests.

Let's rewrite both test files to implement this fix:

# Excerpt ID: 4be7ba54-34f1-4a79-a99e-21fbb01dea40
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the random mode counter reaches zero
            pass
```

# Excerpt ID: 04aa7af3-d13a-4b9f-bd1e-0d47f39d780a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the random mode counter reaches zero
            pass
```

These changes should resolve the test failures by properly handling the RandomModeGracefulExit exception. We're now catching the correct exception that's raised when the random mode counter reaches zero, which can happen in both the MainGameScene and MainMenuScene.

The changes don't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

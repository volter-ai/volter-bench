Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to include an explicit queue for skills and remove them from the queue as they are executed. This change will align the implementation with the specified requirements without altering the overall architecture or the capabilities of the engine.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, instead of returning the skill directly, we'll add it to the `skill_queue`.
3. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use skills from the `skill_queue` and remove them after execution.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 50eb51c5-2146-48ae-b133-a1d0fba97b32
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name} - {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name} - {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
            "Available skills:\n" + "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self._show_text(self.opponent, str(self))

            # Player Choice Phase
            self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        chosen_skill = next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append(chosen_skill)

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
        opponent_skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)

        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name} and dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name} and dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name} and dealt {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name} and dealt {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

This implementation addresses the issue by introducing an explicit `skill_queue` and properly managing it during the battle phases. The skills are now queued during the choice phases and removed from the queue as they are executed in the resolution phase. This change aligns the implementation with the specified requirements while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

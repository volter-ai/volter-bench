Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following improvements to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Ensure that the state of both the player's and opponent's creatures is reset when transitioning out of the scene, regardless of how the transition occurs.
2. Treat the scene more explicitly as a symmetric multiplayer scene by handling both players (human and bot) in a more uniform manner.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll move the creature reset logic to a separate method that will be called before any transition out of the scene.
2. We'll create a list of players to treat both the human player and the bot opponent symmetrically.
3. We'll update the battle logic to iterate over both players, making the code more symmetric.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3f2e2c73-e41c-4a22-94bc-585af4f96798
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, AbstractPlayer
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.players = [self.player, self.opponent]
        self.creatures = [player.creatures[0] for player in self.players]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return "\n".join([
            f"{player.display_name}: {creature.display_name} (HP: {creature.hp}/{creature.max_hp})"
            for player, creature in zip(self.players, self.creatures)
        ] + ["Available skills:"] + [
            f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.creatures[0].skills
        ])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            for player in self.players:
                self._show_text(player, str(self))

            # Choice Phase
            for player, creature in zip(self.players, self.creatures):
                self._player_choice_phase(player, creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_and_transition()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: AbstractPlayer, current_creature: Creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        chosen_skill = next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append(chosen_skill)

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        for i, skill in enumerate(self.skill_queue):
            attacker = self.players[i]
            defender = self.players[1 - i]
            attacker_creature = self.creatures[i]
            defender_creature = self.creatures[1 - i]

            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            for player in self.players:
                self._show_text(player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {skill.damage} damage!")

        self.skill_queue.clear()

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        for i, creature in enumerate(self.creatures):
            if creature.hp <= 0:
                winner = self.players[1 - i]
                loser = self.players[i]
                for player in self.players:
                    self._show_text(player, f"{winner.display_name} won the battle!")
                return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _reset_and_transition(self):
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation addresses both issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `_reset_and_transition` method ensures that the state of both the player's and opponent's creatures is reset before transitioning out of the scene.
2. The scene now treats both players (human and bot) symmetrically by using a list of players and iterating over them for all game actions.

These changes maintain the overall architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the specific issues raised during QA/testing.

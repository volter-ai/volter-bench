Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `test_main_game_scene` function in the `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the test is not handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends. We'll address this by catching this exception in the test function.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll import the `AbstractApp` class to access the `_QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll wrap the `app.transition_to_scene` call in a try-except block that catches the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
3. When we catch this exception, we'll break out of the loop, as it indicates a successful game completion.

This approach will allow the test to run through a complete game cycle without failing due to the expected game termination exception.

Here's the rewritten `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9e73b482-00e5-40e8-b70a-381987a25a59
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            break
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception indicates a successful game completion
            break

    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends normally. By catching this exception, we allow the test to complete successfully when the game reaches its natural conclusion (either by winning, losing, or quitting from the main menu).

The changes are minimal and don't affect the game's core logic or architecture. We're simply improving the test to better handle the expected behavior of the game engine. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models or other parts of the game implementation.

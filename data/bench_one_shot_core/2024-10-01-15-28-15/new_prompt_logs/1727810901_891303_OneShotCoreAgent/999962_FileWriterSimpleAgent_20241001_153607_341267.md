Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `test_main_game_scene` function in the `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the test is not handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends. We need to catch this exception and consider it a normal part of the game flow during testing.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll wrap the `app.transition_to_scene()` call in a try-except block that catches both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions.
2. We'll consider both these exceptions as normal terminations of the game loop during testing.
3. We'll add a counter to ensure that the game runs for a minimum number of iterations before considering the test successful.

Here's the rewritten `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8646788e-9d3f-44f3-8bcf-605a7b02c664
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    from main_game.main import App
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    iterations = 0
    max_iterations = 10
    min_iterations = 3

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
            iterations += 1
        except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
            break

    assert iterations >= min_iterations, f"Game ended too quickly. Only ran for {iterations} iterations, expected at least {min_iterations}."

    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Catching both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions, which are expected to be raised when the game ends normally.
2. Counting the number of successful iterations of the game loop.
3. Asserting that the game ran for at least a minimum number of iterations (in this case, 3) before ending.

This approach ensures that the test passes when the game runs for a reasonable number of turns before ending, either due to the random mode limit or because the player chose to quit from the main menu after returning from the game scene.

The changes are confined to the test file and don't require modifications to the game logic or models, staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

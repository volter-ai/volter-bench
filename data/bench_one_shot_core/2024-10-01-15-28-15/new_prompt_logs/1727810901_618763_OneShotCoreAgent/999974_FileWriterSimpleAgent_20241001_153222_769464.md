Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the following problems:

1. The test is failing because the RandomModeGracefulExit exception is being raised, which is expected behavior but not properly handled in the test.
2. The test is running indefinitely, causing the random mode counter to reach zero and raise the exception.

To solve these issues, we will:

1. Modify the test_main_game_scene function to catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception.
2. Limit the number of iterations in the test to prevent it from running indefinitely.
3. Reset the random mode counter before each iteration to ensure it doesn't reach zero prematurely.

Here's the proposed solution for the test_main_game_scene.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 703d45f0-983e-4fad-96c0-88f447b4be26
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    max_iterations = 3  # Limit the number of iterations to prevent infinite loop

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 50  # Reset the counter before each iteration

        try:
            scene.run()
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends in random mode
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            # If any other exception occurs, fail the test
            pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")

    # If we've completed all iterations without any unexpected exceptions, the test passes
    assert True
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Catching the RandomModeGracefulExit exception in the test function, allowing the test to continue when the exception is raised.
2. Limiting the number of iterations to 3 (adjustable as needed) to prevent the test from running indefinitely.
3. Resetting the random_mode_counter before each iteration to ensure it doesn't reach zero prematurely.

The changes are confined to the test file and do not affect the game's core logic or models. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture.

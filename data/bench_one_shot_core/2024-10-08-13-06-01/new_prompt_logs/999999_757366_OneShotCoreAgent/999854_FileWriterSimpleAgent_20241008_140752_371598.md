## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError where the MainGameScene object has no attribute 'player_action' or 'bot_action'. This error occurs in the get_creature_for_action method of the MainGameScene class. The problem is that we're trying to access attributes that don't exist.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the resolution_phase method to pass the player and bot actions directly to the get_creature_for_action method.
2. We'll update the get_creature_for_action method to compare the action with the passed player and bot actions.
3. We'll ensure that we're correctly identifying which player (human or bot) is performing each action.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: dc4203bc-f7ad-4210-b30f-7a779b79338f

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.player.creatures):

            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError by correctly identifying which player (human or bot) is performing each action. The get_creature_for_action method now takes the player_action and bot_action as parameters, allowing it to determine which creature is performing the action without relying on non-existent attributes.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas, and all the game logic remains within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

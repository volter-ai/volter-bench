## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will reset the creatures and transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 814dd292-3c28-484c-9c8b-6cc0e6f3d68a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.foe_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player Skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe Skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.foe, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.foe_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        foe_skill = self.foe_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Foe used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {player_skill.damage} damage to foe!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Dealt {foe_skill.damage} damage to player!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop continues until `check_battle_end()` returns True.
2. Adding an `end_battle()` method that handles the end of the battle, resets the creatures, and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to properly exit the MainGameScene and return to the main menu.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flows correctly between scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop when the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a proper exit condition is met.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 5515eb70-cf26-47e1-ad36-833f4d62bc8a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the game loop.
2. Modifying the `game_loop` method to continue until the battle has ended.
3. After the battle ends, we reset the creatures and transition back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly by calling `_transition_to_scene`, which should resolve both test failures. The game now has a proper flow: it starts at the main menu, transitions to the battle, and then returns to the main menu after the battle ends.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will reset the creatures and transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 12d0f9c9-f1f5-4d20-ba5d-e255b1bbf9ba
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}: {skill.damage} damage" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Battle start!")

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Opponent used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Opponent dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.bot_creature.hp <= 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost the battle!")

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop continues until a winner is determined.
2. Adding an `_end_battle` method that handles the end of the battle, resets the creatures, and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to properly exit the MainGameScene and return to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene will now properly exit by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, addressing both the random test failures and the whole game flow issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

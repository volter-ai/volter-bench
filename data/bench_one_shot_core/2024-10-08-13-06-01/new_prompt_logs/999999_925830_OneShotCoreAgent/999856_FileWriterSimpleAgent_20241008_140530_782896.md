## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised in the test output, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. There are unserializable attributes (player_action and bot_action) in the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll change the player_action and bot_action attributes to be strings instead of tuples, making them serializable.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the current architecture. We won't need to modify the models, as they are already pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends, ensuring the scene exits properly.
2. Changing `player_action` and `bot_action` to be strings instead of tuples, making them serializable.
3. Modifying the `resolution_phase` to work with the new string-based action format.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

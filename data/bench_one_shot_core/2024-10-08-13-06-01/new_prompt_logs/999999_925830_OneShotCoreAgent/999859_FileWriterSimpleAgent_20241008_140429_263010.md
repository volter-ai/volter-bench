## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'display_name'` error in the `MainGameScene`. This error occurs when we try to swap to a new creature, but the `new_creature` is `None`. This happens when a player has no more creatures available to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `force_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures before attempting to choose one.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll set the player's `active_creature` to `None` and end the battle.
3. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to consider a player with no active creature as having lost the battle.
4. We'll modify the `perform_swap` method to handle the case where `new_creature` might be `None`.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the `NoneType` error by:

1. Handling the case where a player has no active creature in the `__str__` method.
2. Checking for active creatures before performing attacks in the `perform_attack` method.
3. Updating the `force_swap` method to set `active_creature` to `None` when no creatures are available.
4. Modifying the `check_battle_end` method to consider a player with no active creature as having lost the battle.

These changes should resolve the `AttributeError` while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

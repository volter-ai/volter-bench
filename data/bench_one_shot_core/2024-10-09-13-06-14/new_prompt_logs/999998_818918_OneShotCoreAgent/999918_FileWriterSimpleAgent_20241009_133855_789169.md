## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not handling the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first, as specified in the architecture document.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of using a simple comparison of speed values, we'll implement a logic that randomly decides which creature goes first when their speeds are equal. Here's how we'll do it:

   - We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are different, the creature with higher speed will go first (as before).
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - We'll then execute the skills in the order determined by this logic.

2. Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6b2affdc-d25f-4a96-a92c-e6dfee3ae4b3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return False
        else:
            return random.choice([True, False])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):

        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!"
        else:
            result = f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!"
        
        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        
        continue_button = Button("Continue")
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [continue_button])
```

This implementation addresses the issue by introducing a new method `_determine_first_attacker()` which handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. The `_resolution_phase()` method now uses this new method to determine the order of skill execution.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture document's specifications. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

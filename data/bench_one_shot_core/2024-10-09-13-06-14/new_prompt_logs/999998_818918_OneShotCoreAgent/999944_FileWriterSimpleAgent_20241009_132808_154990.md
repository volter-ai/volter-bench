## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a new method `_end_battle` to handle the end of the battle.
2. In the `_end_battle` method, we'll show the battle result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll modify the `run` method to use a while loop that continues until the battle ends.
4. We'll call `_end_battle` when a creature's HP reaches 0.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
        
        self.battle_ended = True
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. The `run` method now uses a while loop that continues until `battle_ended` is set to True, which happens in the `_end_battle` method. This method is called when a creature's HP reaches 0, and it handles showing the battle result and transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

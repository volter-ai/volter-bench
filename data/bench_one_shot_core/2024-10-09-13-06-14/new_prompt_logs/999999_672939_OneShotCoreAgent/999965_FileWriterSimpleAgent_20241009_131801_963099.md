## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not displaying the opposing player's (bot's) skills to the human player during the foe choice phase, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll update the `__str__` method of the `MainGameScene` class to include the opponent's skills.
2. We'll modify the `foe_choice_phase` method to show the opponent's skills to the human player before the bot makes its choice.
3. We'll use the `_show_text` method to display the opponent's skill choice to the human player.

These changes will ensure that the human player is aware of the opponent's available skills and the skill chosen by the opponent, which aligns with the described architecture.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: c87e96a7-807f-4827-9c10-35d62529b9ac
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                if not self.play_again():
                    break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's available skills: {', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills)}")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent chose: {choice.thing.display_name}")
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
            return False
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return False
        return True
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Updating the `__str__` method to include the opponent's skills in the scene description.
2. Modifying the `foe_choice_phase` method to show the opponent's available skills to the human player before the bot makes its choice.
3. Adding a `_show_text` call to inform the human player of the skill chosen by the opponent.

These modifications ensure that the human player is aware of the opponent's available skills and the skill chosen by the opponent during the foe choice phase, aligning with the described architecture and improving the overall gameplay experience.

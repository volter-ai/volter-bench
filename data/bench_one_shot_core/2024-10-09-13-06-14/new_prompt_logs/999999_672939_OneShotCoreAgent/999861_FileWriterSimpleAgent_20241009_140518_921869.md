## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random turn order for creatures with the same speed:
   - In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal.

2. Add prompts for players to swap creatures when their active creature's HP reaches zero:
   - We'll create a new method `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` to handle this logic.
   - We'll call this method after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`.
   - We'll also call this method at the beginning of each turn to ensure players always have an active creature.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Random turn order for creatures with the same speed:
   - In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include `random.random()` as a tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

2. Prompting players to swap creatures when their active creature's HP reaches zero:
   - We've added a new `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method that checks if the active creature has fainted and prompts the player to choose a new one if available.
   - This method is called at the beginning of each turn in the `run` method and after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`.
   - If the player doesn't choose a new creature, the method automatically selects the first available creature to ensure the battle can continue.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

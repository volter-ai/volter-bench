## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. Currently, the scene is not transitioning or quitting after the battle concludes, which causes the test to fail. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to return to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a call to self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") after the battle loop ends.

This change will ensure that the scene exits properly, satisfying the test condition that either _transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game is called.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 10f8c426-7919-46e5-b904-c68ca297947b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your Skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            bot_skill = self._bot_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Add this line to return to the main menu

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _bot_choice_phase(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This change ensures that after the battle ends (win or lose), the scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene. This should resolve the test failure by properly exiting the MainGameScene in an expected manner.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

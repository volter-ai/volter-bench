Content: I understand the issue now. Let's address the discrepancies in the damage calculation for special skills, type effectiveness handling, and the battle end condition messaging. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Special skill damage calculation: We'll adjust the formula to correctly use the ratio of sp_attack to sp_defense.
2. Type effectiveness handling: We'll update the effectiveness dictionary to include all types and their relationships.
3. Battle end condition messaging: We'll provide more detailed messages about the battle outcome.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation for special skills now correctly uses the ratio of sp_attack to sp_defense.
2. The type effectiveness handling has been updated to include all types (normal, fire, water, leaf) and their relationships.
3. The battle end condition messaging now provides more detailed information about which creature was defeated and the battle outcome.

These modifications align the implementation more closely with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

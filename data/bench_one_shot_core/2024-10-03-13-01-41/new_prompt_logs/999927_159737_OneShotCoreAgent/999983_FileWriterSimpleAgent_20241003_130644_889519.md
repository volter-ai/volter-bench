Content: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll address the issues raised during the QA/testing process.

1. Description of the fixes:

a) Convert final damage to an integer:
   We'll modify the `calculate_damage` method to convert the final damage to an integer using the `int()` function before returning it.

b) Remove minimum damage of 1:
   We'll remove the `max(1, final_damage)` check to allow for 0 damage as per the architecture.

c) Remove the message when a skill is used:
   We'll remove the `_show_text` call in the `execute_skill` method that displays the skill usage and damage dealt.

These changes will bring the implementation in line with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 152ea89a-abd3-47fb-becd-1bfa43f0b373
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing process:

1. The final damage is now converted to an integer using `int(type_factor * raw_damage)`.
2. The minimum damage of 1 has been removed, allowing for 0 damage as per the architecture.
3. The message showing skill usage and damage dealt has been removed from the `execute_skill` method.

These modifications bring the implementation in line with the described architecture while maintaining the core functionality of the game.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add handling for the 'normal' type in the type effectiveness calculations:
   - Update the `get_type_factor` method to include 'normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

2. Explicitly convert the final damage calculation to an integer:
   - In the `calculate_damage` method, we'll use `int()` to convert the final damage to an integer before returning it.

These changes will ensure that the implementation adheres to the requirements specified in the architecture documents and resolves the issues identified during QA/testing.

Here's the updated `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 3e3a4bf7-723e-4134-8417-7597f14aa250
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.current_turn += 1
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)  # Explicitly convert to integer
        return final_damage

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {},  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'normal' type is now handled in the `get_type_factor` method. It's added to the `effectiveness` dictionary with an empty dictionary as its value, which means it will always return the default value of 1 (neither effective nor ineffective against any type).

2. The final damage calculation in the `calculate_damage` method now explicitly converts the result to an integer using `int()`.

These modifications ensure that the implementation adheres to the requirements specified in the architecture documents and resolves the issues identified during QA/testing.

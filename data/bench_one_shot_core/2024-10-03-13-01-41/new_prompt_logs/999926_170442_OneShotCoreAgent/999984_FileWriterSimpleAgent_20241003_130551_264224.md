Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The whole game flow is not properly handling the end of the battle.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `battle_loop` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will ensure that the scene properly exits and the game flow continues as expected. Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: d6f3cd56-6f42-4e9f-b75d-5ed9196beae9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that is called after the battle loop ends.
2. In the `end_battle` method, we reset the creatures, show a message to the player, and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The `battle_loop` now calls `end_battle` after breaking out of the loop, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends, rather than terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

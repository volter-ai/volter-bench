Content: Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Proposed fixes:

a) Explicit skill display during Player Choice Phase:
   We'll modify the player_choice_phase method to show the skills explicitly before asking for a choice.

b) Remove math.ceil() for damage calculation:
   We'll adjust the calculate_damage method to use integer division and remove the math.ceil() function.

c) Remove minimum damage enforcement:
   We'll remove the max(1, final_damage) check to allow for 0 damage.

d) Reset only the player's creatures at the end of the battle:
   We'll modify the reset_creatures method to only reset the player's creatures.

e) Handle simultaneous creature knockouts:
   We'll update the check_battle_end method to handle cases where both creatures are knocked out simultaneously.

2. Rewritten file:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. We now explicitly display the skills and their descriptions during the Player Choice Phase.
2. The damage calculation no longer uses math.ceil() and instead uses integer division for special attacks.
3. We've removed the minimum damage enforcement, allowing for 0 damage.
4. The reset_creatures method now only resets the player's creatures, not the opponent's.
5. We've added handling for simultaneous creature knockouts in the check_battle_end method.

These modifications align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing all the issues raised in the QA feedback.

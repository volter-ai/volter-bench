Content: Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I'll address these issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture.

1. Description of the fix:

a) Weakness-resistance factor:
We'll change the 0.5 value to 1/2 in the `get_type_factor` method to match the architecture description exactly.

b) Damage calculation:
We'll modify the `calculate_damage` method to explicitly use floats for intermediate calculations and show the final conversion to an integer.

c) Minimum damage:
We'll remove the minimum damage of 1, as it's not specified in the architecture.

To implement these changes, we'll modify the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. We'll update the `calculate_damage` and `get_type_factor` methods to align with the architecture precisely.

2. Rewritten file:

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `get_type_factor` method now uses 1/2 instead of 0.5 for ineffective type matchups.
2. The `calculate_damage` method now explicitly uses floats for intermediate calculations.
3. The final damage conversion to an integer is now explicitly shown in the `calculate_damage` method.
4. The minimum damage of 1 has been removed, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while maintaining the core functionality of the game. The implementation now fully aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

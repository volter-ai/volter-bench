Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. In the whole game flow test, the MainGameScene is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended and determine the winner.
2. After each turn, we'll check if the battle has ended.
3. If the battle has ended, we'll show the result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Properly checking for the battle end condition after each turn.
2. Showing the battle result when the battle ends.
3. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These changes should resolve both the MainGameScene test failure and the whole game flow test failure. The scene now properly exits by transitioning to another scene when the battle is over, which should satisfy the engine's requirements.

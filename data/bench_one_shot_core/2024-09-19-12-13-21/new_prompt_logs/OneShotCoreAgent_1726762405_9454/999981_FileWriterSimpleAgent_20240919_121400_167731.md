## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue with the type effectiveness logic not accounting for the 'Leaf' type relationships, we need to update the `get_type_effectiveness` method in the `MainGameScene` class. This change will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll update the `get_type_effectiveness` method to include all the type relationships specified in the architecture documentation, including the 'Leaf' type.
2. We'll ensure that all combinations of types are accounted for, including normal-type interactions.
3. We'll keep the method within the `MainGameScene` class to maintain the separation of concerns and keep the models as pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Updating the `get_type_effectiveness` method to include all type relationships, including 'Leaf'.
2. Ensuring that all combinations of types are accounted for, including normal-type interactions.
3. Using lowercase comparisons to make the type matching case-insensitive.

These changes should resolve the issue with type effectiveness while maintaining the existing architecture and adhering to the engine's capabilities. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

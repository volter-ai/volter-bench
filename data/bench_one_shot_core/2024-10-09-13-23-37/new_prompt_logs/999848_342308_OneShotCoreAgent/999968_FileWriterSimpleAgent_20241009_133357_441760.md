## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for the detailed feedback. I understand the issues raised and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Damage calculation precision: We'll use float calculations throughout and only round to an integer at the final step.
2. Handling of ties: We'll implement a clear tie-breaking mechanism for speed ties.
3. Clarity in weakness-resistance factor application: We'll make the application of this factor more explicit in the damage calculation.
4. Reset of creature states: We'll integrate this more clearly into the transition logic.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file, as the models should remain pure data schemas. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: bbd5a453-404b-442d-b34e-7aaa58bacc01
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            # Tie-breaking mechanism: use creature's uid as a consistent tie-breaker
            return (creature1, creature2) if creature1.uid < creature2.uid else (creature2, creature1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {damage} damage.")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill) -> int:
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = raw_damage * weakness_factor

        return max(1, int(round(final_damage)))  # Ensure minimum 1 damage

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_weakness_factor(skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {},
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _transition_to_scene(self, scene_name: str):
        self.reset_creatures()
        super()._transition_to_scene(scene_name)

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. Damage calculation precision: We now use float calculations throughout the `calculate_damage` method and only round to an integer at the final step.
2. Handling of ties: We've implemented a clear tie-breaking mechanism in the `determine_order` method using the creatures' uids.
3. Clarity in weakness-resistance factor application: The application of this factor is now more explicit in the `calculate_damage` method.
4. Reset of creature states: We've overridden the `_transition_to_scene` method to ensure creature states are reset before transitioning.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

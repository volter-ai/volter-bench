## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight. I'll address the issues more thoroughly, focusing on aligning the implementation with the architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Move the damage calculation logic to the `Skill` model, making it a class method to keep the model as a pure data schema.
2. Update the type effectiveness calculation to match the architecture description.
3. Implement the reset of creature states when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`.
4. Ensure all models inherit from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`.

I'll need to update both the `models.py` and `main_game_scene.py` files. Here are the rewritten files:

# Excerpt ID: afd7ab0f-8360-4e2e-bfbd-b1b8c468ea7a
```python main_game/models.py

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = cls.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def reset_creatures(self):

            creature.reset_hp()

    def run(self):

            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = Skill.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {damage} damage.")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player.reset_creatures()
        self.opponent.reset_creatures()
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation logic is now in the `Skill` model as a class method, keeping the model as a pure data schema.
2. The type effectiveness calculation has been updated to match the architecture description, including handling for the 'normal' type.
3. The reset of creature states is now implemented in the `Player` model and called when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`.
4. All models inherit from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer` as required.

These changes should align the implementation with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

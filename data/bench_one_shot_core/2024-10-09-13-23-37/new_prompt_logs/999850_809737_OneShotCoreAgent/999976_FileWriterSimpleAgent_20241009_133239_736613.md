## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I understand the issues raised, and I'll address them to align the implementation more closely with the described architecture. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Remove the 'max_turns' attribute and related logic from MainGameScene.
2. Restructure the turn logic to follow the explicitly described three-phase structure: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
3. Update the weakness-resistance factor calculation to explicitly handle the 'Leaf' type as described in the architecture.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: a4ee00ff-7421-400c-9ea4-a5936b82d194

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The 'max_turns' attribute and related logic have been removed.
2. The turn structure now explicitly follows the three-phase structure described in the architecture: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
3. The weakness-resistance factor calculation now explicitly handles all types, including 'Leaf', as described in the architecture.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas inheriting from the appropriate base classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

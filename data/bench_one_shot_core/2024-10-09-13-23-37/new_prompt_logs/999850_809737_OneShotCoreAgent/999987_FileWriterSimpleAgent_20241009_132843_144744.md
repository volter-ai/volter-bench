## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

The issue is in the damage calculation process, which is currently using integers instead of floats as specified in the architecture documents. To fix this, we need to modify the `calculate_damage` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll use floats throughout the calculation process and only convert to an integer at the final step.

Here's how we'll fix it:

a. Change the `raw_damage` calculation to use floats.
b. Keep the `type_factor` as a float.
c. Perform the final damage calculation using floats.
d. Convert the final damage to an integer only at the end of the calculation.

This change will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. We don't need to modify the models or any other files, as this is purely a logic change within the scene.

2. Updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

        return False
```

This updated `main_game_scene.py` file now uses floats throughout the damage calculation process, as specified in the architecture documents. The final damage is only converted to an integer at the end of the calculation, ensuring more accurate results. This change should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

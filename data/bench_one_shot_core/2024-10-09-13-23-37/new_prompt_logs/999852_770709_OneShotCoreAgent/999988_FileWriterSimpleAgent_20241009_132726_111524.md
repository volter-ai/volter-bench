## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The random run test for MainGameScene is not detecting the end of the scene correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _check_battle_end method to transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, instead of just returning True.
2. We'll also add a small delay after showing the battle result text to ensure the player can read the outcome before transitioning.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: aa614e3e-9c51-4aee-8f85-dda4de268391
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{self._get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            time.sleep(2)  # Add a small delay to ensure the message is read
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Add a small delay to ensure the message is read
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The MainGameScene now properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, instead of just returning True.
2. A small delay (2 seconds) has been added after showing the battle result text to ensure the player can read the outcome before transitioning.
3. The _check_battle_end method now calls _transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") instead of just returning True, which should resolve the issue of the scene not exiting properly.

These modifications should fix the failing tests and ensure that the game flow works as expected, transitioning between scenes correctly and ending battles appropriately.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

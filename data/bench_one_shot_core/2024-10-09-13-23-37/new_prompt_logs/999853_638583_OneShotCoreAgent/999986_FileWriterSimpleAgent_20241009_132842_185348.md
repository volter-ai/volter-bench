## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Reset the player's creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene:
   - In the `MainGameScene.run()` method, we'll add a function to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the weakness-resistance factor calculation:
   - We'll update the `calculate_weakness_factor()` method to explicitly return 1 for 'normal' type skills.

3. Improve the damage calculation for special attacks to avoid floating-point precision issues:
   - We'll modify the damage calculation for special attacks to use integer division and multiplication.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: 723d5079-b6a2-449c-be5a-a74f1d0aff75
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack * skill.base_damage) // defender.sp_defense

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = (weakness_factor * raw_damage) // 100
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 100
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 200, "water": 50},
            "water": {"fire": 200, "leaf": 50},
            "leaf": {"water": 200, "fire": 50}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 100)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The `reset_creatures()` method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their maximum.
2. The `calculate_weakness_factor()` method now explicitly handles the 'normal' type by returning 100 (which represents a factor of 1 in our integer-based calculation).
3. The damage calculation for special attacks now uses integer division (`//`) to avoid floating-point precision issues. The weakness factor is also applied using integer arithmetic.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the structure and capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

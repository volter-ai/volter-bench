## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random selection for equal speeds:
   - In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal.

2. Explicitly convert final damage to an integer:
   - In the `_execute_skill` method, we'll use the `int()` function to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer before subtracting it from the defender's HP.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, which should remain pure data schemas.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random factor in the sorting key for the turn queue. This ensures that when creatures have equal speeds, the order is determined randomly.

2. In the `_execute_skill` method, the `final_damage` calculation now explicitly uses the `int()` function to convert the result to an integer before subtracting it from the defender's HP.

These modifications maintain the integrity of the models as pure data schemas and work within the capabilities of the provided engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problems and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene:
      - We'll add a method to reset creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning.

   b. Implement team battles instead of single creature battles:
      - We'll modify the MainGameScene to handle multiple creatures for both the player and the opponent.
      - We'll implement a system to switch creatures when one is defeated.

   c. Show the player's creature's list of skills before making a choice:
      - We'll modify the player_choice_phase to display the current creature's skills before prompting for a choice.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9cfc2705-f2ec-4a3d-85f9-a1f6ec8b1f5c

        self.player_creature = self.player_team[0]

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. It resets the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene using the `reset_creatures` method.
2. It implements team battles by maintaining lists of creatures for both the player and opponent, and switches creatures when one is defeated.
3. It shows the player's creature's list of skills before making a choice in the `player_choice_phase` method.

The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture guidelines. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

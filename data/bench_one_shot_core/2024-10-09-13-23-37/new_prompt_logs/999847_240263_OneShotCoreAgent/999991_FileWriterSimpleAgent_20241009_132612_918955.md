## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight. You're right, and I'll address these issues by adhering more closely to the architecture and removing unnecessary additions. Here's how I'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. Remove the battle count and max battles feature, as it's not part of the architecture.
2. Implement a queue system for skills in the resolution phase.
3. Ensure that the scene logic follows the Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase structure.
4. Keep the battle running until one creature's HP reaches zero.
5. Transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: b0d14b7a-f597-4eaa-ab84-6312b3b12d45
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

Skill Queue: {', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.skill_queue)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You encountered {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                attacker, defender = self.player, self.opponent
                attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
            else:
                attacker, defender = self.opponent, self.player
                attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature

            self._show_text(attacker, f"Your {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(defender, f"Opponent's {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage

            self._show_text(attacker, f"You dealt {skill.damage} damage!")
            self._show_text(defender, f"You received {skill.damage} damage!")

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your creature fainted. You lost!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Your creature fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now correctly follows the architecture:

1. It uses a queue system (`self.skill_queue`) for skills in the resolution phase.
2. The battle continues until one creature's HP reaches zero.
3. The scene follows the Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase structure.
4. After the battle ends, it transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
5. The unnecessary battle count and max battles features have been removed.

This solution should address the issues raised in the QA pass while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the specified architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

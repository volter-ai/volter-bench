## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two modifications to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Ensure that the player's creatures' states are reset when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Perform intermediate damage calculations with floats before converting to integers.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_end_battle` method, we'll reset all creatures' HP to their max HP for both the player and the bot.
2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, we'll use float calculations for intermediate steps and only convert to an integer at the final step.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: accd3ce1-24e8-48b6-86e0-46944bf480cc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. In the `_end_battle` method, we now reset the HP of all creatures (both for the player and the bot) to their maximum HP before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, we now use `float()` for all intermediate calculations to ensure precision. The final result is still converted to an integer using `int()`.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

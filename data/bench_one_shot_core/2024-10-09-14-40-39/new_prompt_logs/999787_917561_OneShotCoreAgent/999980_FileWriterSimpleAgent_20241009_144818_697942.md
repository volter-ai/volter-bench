## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the issues and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Reset player's creatures' state:
   - We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning out.
   
   b. Floating-point precision in damage calculations:
   - We'll use round() function to ensure consistent rounding behavior.
   
   c. Handling of skill effectiveness:
   - We'll update the calculate_weakness_factor method to strictly follow the specifications.

2. We'll rewrite the main_game_scene.py file to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: bde6355f-97a3-4049-b898-c98e02892122
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.get_active_creature(self.player)
        self.opponent_creature = self.get_active_creature(self.opponent)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. We've added a `reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max_hp. This method is called at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that creatures' states are reset before transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

2. We've updated the `execute_skill` method to use `round()` when calculating the final damage, ensuring consistent rounding behavior and addressing the floating-point precision issue.

3. We've revised the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to strictly follow the specifications for skill effectiveness. It now handles each type combination explicitly, returning the correct factor for each case.

These changes maintain the separation of concerns between models and game logic, and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

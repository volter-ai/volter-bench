## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll describe how to fix these issues and then provide the updated MainGameScene file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the three main issues:

a) Equal speed resolution:
We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use a random factor when sorting actions with equal speed. This ensures that creatures with the same speed will have their actions resolved in a random order.

b) Final damage calculation:
We'll update the `_calculate_damage` method to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the `int()` function.

c) Resetting player's creatures state:
We'll modify the `_end_battle` method to ensure that all creatures' HP is reset to their max HP when leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class, keeping the models as pure data schemas and staying within the engine's capabilities.

2. Rewritten file with the proposed solution:

```

This updated implementation addresses all three issues:

1. Equal speed resolution: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we now use `random.random()` as a third sorting key to randomly resolve actions with equal speed.

2. Final damage calculation: In the `_calculate_damage` method, we now explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using `int()`.

3. Resetting player's creatures state: In the `_end_battle` method, we now reset all creatures' HP to their max HP for both the player and the opponent.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

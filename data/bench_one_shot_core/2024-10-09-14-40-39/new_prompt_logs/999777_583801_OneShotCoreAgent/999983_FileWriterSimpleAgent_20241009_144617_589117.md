## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problems and provide a solution that adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when creatures have equal speed:
      - In the `_resolve_turn` method, we'll add a check for equal speed and use `random.choice` to determine the order.

   b. Handle the 'Normal' type relationship explicitly:
      - We'll modify the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method to explicitly handle the 'Normal' type.

2. I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement these fixes.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 74824792-1a19-4867-b49d-d9f82e3dddf3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._end_battle()
            return True

    def _end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Implementing random decision-making for skill execution order when creatures have equal speed in the `_resolve_turn` method.
2. Explicitly handling the 'Normal' type relationship in the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing functionality while addressing the specific issues raised in the QA/testing phase.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

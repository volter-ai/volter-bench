## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

   a) Damage calculation for special attacks:
   We'll modify the calculation to explicitly convert the result to an integer using the int() function.

   b) Type effectiveness calculation:
   We'll add an explicit mention of the 'normal' type in the effectiveness dictionary, setting its factor to 1 for all types.

   c) Battle end message:
   We'll add a more detailed message informing the player whether they've won or lost after the battle ends.

   d) Reset creatures method:
   We'll modify the reset_creatures() method to only reset the player's creatures, not the opponent's.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 0b68090f-dd1e-4dfc-9de6-e151c45cdb18
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation for special attacks now explicitly converts the result to an integer using `int()`.
2. The type effectiveness calculation now includes the 'normal' type explicitly, with a factor of 1 for all types.
3. The battle end messages now provide more detailed information about which creature fainted and whether the player won or lost.
4. The `reset_creatures()` method now only resets the player's creatures, not the opponent's.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Update the `MainGameScene` class in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` to display the opponent's skills during the Foe Choice Phase.
2. Modify the `calculate_weakness` method in the same file to account for the 'Normal' type relationships in the damage calculation.

These changes will improve the game's transparency and accuracy without altering the existing models or architecture. Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 5f1f2cd2-6476-4ed7-8dc6-c9b7100e5d7b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

Opponent's skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "A challenger approaches!")

        while True:
            if self.battle_round():
                break

    def battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
        return self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} is choosing a skill...")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has chosen a skill!")
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        if self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):
            return True
        if self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill):
            return True
        return False

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {final_damage} damage!")

        if defender.hp == 0:
            winner = self.player if defender == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def calculate_weakness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        weaknesses = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5},
            "normal": {}  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        }
        return weaknesses.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `__str__` method now includes the opponent's skills, making them visible during the game.
2. The `foe_choice_phase` method now shows messages to the player about the opponent's skill selection process, improving transparency.
3. The `calculate_weakness` method now includes the 'Normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other type, as specified in the game design.

These modifications improve the game's functionality and adherence to the original design without altering the existing models or overall architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

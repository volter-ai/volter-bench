## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class when there are no available creatures to swap to. We'll modify the `choose_swap` method to handle this case gracefully.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. In the `get_player_action` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None`.
4. If swapping is not possible, we'll force the player to choose an attack instead.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(player, creature_choices)
        self.swap_creature(player, new_creature.thing)
        return True
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Modifying `choose_swap` to return `None` when there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. Updating `get_player_action` to handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None`, forcing the player to choose an attack instead.
3. Adding a check in `execute_skill` to force a swap when a creature faints.
4. Improving the `force_swap` method to handle cases where a player has no more creatures able to battle.

These modifications should prevent the `_wait_for_choice` method from being called with an empty list of choices, resolving the AssertionError we were seeing in the tests. The game logic now handles situations where players run out of creatures to swap more gracefully, ensuring that the battle continues as long as at least one creature is available.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

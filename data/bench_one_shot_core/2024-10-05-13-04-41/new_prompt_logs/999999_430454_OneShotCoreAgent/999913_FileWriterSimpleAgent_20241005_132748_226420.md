Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a check in the run method to break the loop when the battle ends.
3. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 8c9023d6-131a-4047-a2dc-991bff0a6a35
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            if self.current_phase == "player_choice":
                self._player_choice_phase()

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self._determine_order()
        self._execute_skill(first[1], first[2], second[2])

        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to break the loop when the battle ends.
3. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean.
4. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the FixableException in the test_whole_game.py and allow the MainGameScene to exit properly. The scene will now transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, which should also fix the assertion error in test_main_game_scene.py.

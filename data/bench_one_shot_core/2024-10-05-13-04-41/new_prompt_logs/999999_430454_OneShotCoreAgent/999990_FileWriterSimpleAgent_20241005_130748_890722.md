Content: To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll handle this in the scene itself.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9a98cecd-58d6-480d-b16e-d45a7930c420
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self.bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot's turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Player's skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}! It dealt {player_skill.damage} damage.")
        
        # Bot's skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Bot used {bot_skill.display_name}! It dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage.")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds the `reset_creatures_state()` method to the MainGameScene class. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot to their maximum HP. The method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `check_battle_end()` method.

This approach ensures that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

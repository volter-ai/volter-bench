Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. In the whole game flow test, the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow of the game.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the `run` method, we'll add a condition to break the main loop when the battle ends.
3. After the main loop, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1f7d3e99-5b43-4502-ad88-6d4ffddc50e6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You're facing {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):

        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":

        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The MainGameScene now properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. The scene no longer terminates without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

By transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, we ensure that the game flow continues as expected, and the player can choose to play another battle or quit the game from the main menu.

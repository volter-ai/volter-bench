Content: To address the issue of not explicitly handling the case where creatures have the same speed in the resolution phase, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. Add a method to compare creature speeds and resolve ties randomly.
2. Modify the resolution phase to use this new method for determining the order of actions.
3. Ensure that the speed comparison is used for both attack actions, while still prioritizing swap actions.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe.active_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

```

This solution addresses the issue raised in the QA testing by explicitly handling the case where creatures have the same speed in the resolution phase. The key changes are:

1. Added a `compare_speeds` method to compare creature speeds and resolve ties randomly.
2. Modified the `resolution_phase` method to sort attack actions based on creature speed.
3. When creatures have the same speed, their order is randomized using the `compare_speeds` method.

These changes ensure that the implementation correctly handles speed ties as described in the architecture, while maintaining the existing game logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

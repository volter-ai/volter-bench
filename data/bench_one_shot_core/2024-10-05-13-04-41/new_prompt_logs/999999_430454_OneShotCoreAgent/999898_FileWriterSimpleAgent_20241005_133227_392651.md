Content: To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' states when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, I will make the following changes:

1. We can't add methods to the models as they should be pure data schemas. Instead, we'll implement a helper function in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' states.

2. We'll call this helper function just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the battle.

3. The reset function will restore the HP of all creatures to their max_hp value.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b20d835d-21ea-40f1-97da-3836b92116d3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds a new `_reset_creatures_state` method to the MainGameScene class. This method iterates through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their maximum value. The method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene.

This approach adheres to the guidelines by keeping the models as pure data schemas and implementing the reset logic within the scene itself. It also stays within the capabilities of the engine by using the existing scene methods and data structures.

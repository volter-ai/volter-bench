Content: I understand the issue now. The error occurs because we're passing a Player object instead of a Creature object to the _calculate_damage method. This is likely due to a mistake in how we're handling the attacker and defender in the _execute_skill method. Let's fix this issue by updating the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we'll pass the correct Creature objects to _execute_skill instead of Player objects.
2. We'll adjust the _execute_skill method to take Creature objects directly for both attacker and defender.
3. We'll update the type hints in the _calculate_damage method to ensure we're using Creature objects.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

These changes should resolve the AttributeError by ensuring that we're passing Creature objects to the _calculate_damage method instead of Player objects. The game logic remains the same, but now it correctly handles the creatures during the battle phase.

The main changes are:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we now pass the Creature objects (first[1] and second[1]) instead of Player objects to _execute_skill.
2. The _execute_skill method now takes a Creature object for both attacker and defender, and a separate Player object for the attacker_player (used for display purposes).
3. The type hints in the _calculate_damage method have been updated to ensure we're using Creature objects.

These changes maintain the structure of the models and adhere to the architecture and capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a new method `end_battle` to handle the end of the battle scenario.
2. In the `end_battle` method, we'll show the result message and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to call `end_battle` when the battle is over.
4. We'll ensure that the main game loop continues until the battle ends.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: babafa8a-5d66-4e0c-af5e-8f388a20b336
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill)

    def determine_turn_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle continues until one of the creatures' HP reaches zero.
2. When the battle ends, it properly shows the result message.
3. After the battle ends, it transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
4. The scene doesn't terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

This solution should resolve both issues raised in the QA/testing phase while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and propose a solution that adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement the correct skill execution order based on creature speed, we'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

a) Modify the resolution phase to consider creature speed:
   - We'll create a list of actions (swaps and attacks) ordered by creature speed.
   - Swaps will still be executed first, but among attacks, faster creatures will act first.

b) Implement a method to compare actions based on creature speed:
   - This method will be used to sort the actions list.
   - Swaps will always have higher priority than attacks.
   - For attacks, compare the speed of the attacking creatures.

c) Update the perform_attack method:
   - Pass both the attacker and defender as parameters to ensure correct execution order.

These changes will ensure that the game follows the required architecture and handles skill execution order correctly based on creature speed.

```

This implementation addresses the issue raised in the QA pass:

1. The resolution phase now considers the speed of the creatures to determine the order of skill execution.
2. Swaps are still executed before attacks, maintaining the previous logic.
3. Among attacks, faster creatures act first, as specified in the architecture documentation.

The changes maintain the structure of the existing code while ensuring that the game follows the required architecture and handles skill execution order correctly based on creature speed. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

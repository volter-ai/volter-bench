Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning or quitting correctly after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game when the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the battle loop continues until a winner is determined, and then properly exit the scene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: f7b0ce78-1efa-4ebd-8f42-a459383e78c5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        play_again = Button("Play Again")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, quit_game])
        
        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This revised version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. In the `end_battle` method, we give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve both the issue in the MainGameScene test and the whole game flow test.

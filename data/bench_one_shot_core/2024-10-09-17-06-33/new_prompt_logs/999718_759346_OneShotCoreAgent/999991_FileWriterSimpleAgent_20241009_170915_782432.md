## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not implementing random order selection when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, I will modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the solution:

   - Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - Implement the skill execution based on this random selection.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as it only affects the game logic within the scene.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e92fdd9e-e5b0-4947-ad99-2dd8a2b36284
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._reset_creatures()
            while True:

                    break
            
            play_again = self._ask_play_again()
            if not play_again:

        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self._execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _ask_play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly selecting which creature goes first. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, maintaining compatibility with the existing architecture and models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The `MainGameScene` is not properly ending the game or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll address the problems:

1. We'll add a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and returns to the main menu.

2. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

3. We'll update the `game_loop` method to break out of the loop when the battle ends and then transition to the main menu.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7f10cd83-2f4c-44e7-a1e9-604cff8ea8cf
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `game_loop` method now breaks out of the loop when the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends and creatures are reset, the scene transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly and transitions to another scene after the battle ends, which should fix both the test failures and the FixableException that was being raised.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

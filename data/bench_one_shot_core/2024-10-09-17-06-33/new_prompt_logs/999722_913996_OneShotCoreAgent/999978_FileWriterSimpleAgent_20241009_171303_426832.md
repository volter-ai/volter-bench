## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method to the Player model, which violates the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties. To fix this, we need to remove the class method from the Player model and handle the initialization of the active_creature in the scene where the player is created.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player model in `models.py`.
2. Make the `active_creature` field optional in the Player model.
3. Initialize the `active_creature` in the `App.create_player` method in `main.py`.

Let's rewrite the `models.py` and `main.py` files to implement this solution:

# Excerpt ID: 5bde8d36-b5fd-4b02-8c69-3f0714a0aeb1
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

# Excerpt ID: 7ebff243-ec80-4d2b-adfd-756c9812679c
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player
import uuid

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_from_game_database("default_player", Player)
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_from_game_database(prototype_id, Player)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Removing the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player model, making it a pure data schema.
2. Keeping the `active_creature` field as optional in the Player model.
3. Using `create_from_game_database` to create Player instances in the `App.create_player` and `App.create_bot` methods.
4. Initializing the `active_creature` in the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods after creating the Player instance.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the guidelines for model implementation. The Player class remains a pure data schema, and the initialization logic is moved to the appropriate place in the `main.py` file.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

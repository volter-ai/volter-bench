## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the tests to fail because the scene is not exiting in the expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the battle_loop method to transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, instead of just breaking the loop.

2. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle, to ensure that subsequent battles start with full health.

Here's the proposed solution:

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp

```

This solution addresses the main issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends. The `reset_creatures` method is added to restore the creatures' HP to their maximum values, preparing them for potential future battles.

The key changes are:

1. In the `battle_loop` method, we now call `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after `check_battle_end()` returns True.
2. We've added a new `reset_creatures` method to restore HP after each battle.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the game. This should resolve the test failures and make the game flow more robust.

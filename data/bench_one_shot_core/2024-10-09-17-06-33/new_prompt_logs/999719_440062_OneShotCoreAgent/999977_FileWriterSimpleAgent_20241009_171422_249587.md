## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Fixing the issues:

   a) Incorrect damage calculation for special skills:
   We'll update the damage calculation formula in the `_execute_skill` method of `MainGameScene`.

   b) Missing forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   We'll add a new method `_force_swap` in `MainGameScene` and call it after each skill execution.

   c) Incomplete battle end handling:
   We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to properly handle the battle end conditions.

   d) Resetting creature states when leaving MainGameScene:
   We'll implement this in the `_end_battle` method of `MainGameScene`.

2. Rewriting the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues mentioned:

1. The damage calculation for special skills now correctly uses the ratio of sp_attack to sp_defense.
2. Forced swapping is implemented in the `_force_swap` method, which is called after each skill execution.
3. The battle end handling is now complete, checking for all creatures fainted for both players.
4. Creature states are reset in the `_end_battle` method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes maintain the architecture where models are pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scene. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and should now fully meet the specified requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

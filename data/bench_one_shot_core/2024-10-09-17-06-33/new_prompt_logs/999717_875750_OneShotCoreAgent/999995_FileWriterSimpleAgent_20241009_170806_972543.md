## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly ending the game or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The test for MainGameScene is not capturing the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll update the check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll add a new method called end_battle to handle the transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: a1c442d1-102d-41ce-b418-ba8a6922b97c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        self.execute_skill(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player else opponent_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, opponent_skill if first == self.player else player_skill)

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        attacker_creature = attacker.creatures[0]
        defender_creature = defender.creatures[0]
        damage = max(0, attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly ends the battle and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over. This should resolve the issue where the scene was not exiting in an expected manner and should make the tests pass.

The main changes are:

1. In the `run` method, we now break the loop when `check_battle_end()` returns True.
2. We've added a new `end_battle` method that shows a message and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The `check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean instead of just showing text.

These changes should fix the issues in the test cases while maintaining the game's logic and adhering to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised in the test failures, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the game is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The random run test for `MainGameScene` is not detecting the scene exit, which suggests that we're not using the correct methods to end the scene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that we're using the correct methods (`_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`) to exit the scene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

The main changes in this updated `MainGameScene` are:

1. In the `game_loop` method, we now return from the method after transitioning to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends. This ensures that the scene exits properly.

2. We've modified the `_check_battle_end` method to return `True` when the battle is over, allowing the `game_loop` to detect when it should transition to the main menu.

3. We've updated the `_resolution_phase` and `_execute_skill` methods to correctly use the skills chosen by each player.

These changes should resolve the issues raised in the test failures. The scene will now properly exit when the battle ends, and it will transition back to the main menu, allowing the game to continue or end gracefully.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game is not transitioning back to the main menu or quitting after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `run` method to transition back to the main menu after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and use this to break out of the main game loop.
3. We'll add a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the game loop ends.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and returns to the main menu, satisfying the test conditions and improving the overall flow of the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

        actions.sort(key=lambda x: x[0].active_creature.speed, reverse=True)

        for actor, action in actions:
            if action[0] == "Swap":
                self.perform_swap(actor, action[1])

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `run` method now has a `battle_ended` flag that controls the main game loop.
2. After the battle ends, the scene transitions back to the main menu using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.
3. The `check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean, which is used to determine when to exit the main game loop.

These modifications ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits and transitions back to the main menu after a battle ends, which should satisfy the test conditions and improve the overall flow of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will reset the creatures and transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the run method doesn't exit without calling either _transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ad8dd072-bc61-4dd4-bf70-5f85096f54d4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                return

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)

                return (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:

        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! {self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:

        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `run` method always ends with a call to `end_battle()`, which in turn calls `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that resets the creatures and transitions back to the main menu.
3. Removing the `break` statement from the main game loop and replacing it with a `return` statement after calling `end_battle()`.

These modifications should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The test cases should now pass as the scene will always exit in an expected manner.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

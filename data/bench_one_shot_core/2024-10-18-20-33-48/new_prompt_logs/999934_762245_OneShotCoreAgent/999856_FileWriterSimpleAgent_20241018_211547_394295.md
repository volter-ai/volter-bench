## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The error occurs because the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. We'll address this by adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_check_battle_end` method, we'll return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the `run` method, we'll add a condition to check if the battle has ended.
3. If the battle has ended, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.

Here's the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. The `_check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean, which is used in the `run` method to determine when to end the battle and transition to the main menu. Additionally, we reset the creatures' HP before transitioning, ensuring that the game state is properly reset for the next battle.

This change stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

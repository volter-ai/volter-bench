## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll address these issues in the MainGameScene. Here's how I plan to fix them:

1. To handle the case where creatures have the same speed:
   - We'll add a method to randomly decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
   - This will be implemented in the _resolution_phase method.

2. To reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the scene:
   - We'll add a _reset_creatures method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.
   - We'll call this method in the _check_battle_end method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will align the implementation with the described architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: bd2610fe-03f8-4395-8aed-0805b9d3d8e9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:

        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Random decision when speeds are equal
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = (self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
            else:
                first, second = (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player_creature, player_skill)

        self._execute_skill(first[0], second[0], first[1])
        if second[0].hp > 0:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The _resolution_phase method now handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first.
2. The _reset_creatures method is added to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp, and it's called in the _check_battle_end method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

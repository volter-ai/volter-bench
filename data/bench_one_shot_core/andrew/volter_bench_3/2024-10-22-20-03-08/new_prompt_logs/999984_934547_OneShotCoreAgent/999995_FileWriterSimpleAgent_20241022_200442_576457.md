## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The test for the full game flow is failing because the MainGameScene is not properly ending or transitioning.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop properly exits after the battle ends and the transition occurs.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: fd47a07d-44b8-4932-af20-8e9df3e20f0f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the game loop.
2. Modifying the `game_loop` method to exit when the battle ends.
3. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends and creatures are reset.

This solution should resolve both the MainGameScene random run test and the full game flow test failures. The scene now properly exits and transitions to another scene, following the engine's architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

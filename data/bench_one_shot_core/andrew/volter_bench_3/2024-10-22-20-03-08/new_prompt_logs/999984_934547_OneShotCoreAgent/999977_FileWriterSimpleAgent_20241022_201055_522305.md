## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture description and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. How to fix the issues:

a) Equal speed resolution: We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to include a random tiebreaker when creatures have equal speed.

b) Float calculations: We'll ensure that all damage calculations use float values until the final step, where we'll convert to an integer.

c) Forced swapping: We'll implement a new method _check_and_swap_fainted_creature that will be called after each attack to check if a creature has fainted and force a swap if necessary.

2. The file that needs to be rewritten is main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py. Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 89f26637-2bb8-4c9a-ad86-3962a559d353

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. Equal speed resolution: The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random tiebreaker when sorting the turn queue.
2. Float calculations: All damage calculations now use float values until the final step where we convert to an integer.
3. Forced swapping: A new `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method has been implemented and is called after each attack to check if a creature has fainted and force a swap if necessary.

These changes align with the architecture description and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

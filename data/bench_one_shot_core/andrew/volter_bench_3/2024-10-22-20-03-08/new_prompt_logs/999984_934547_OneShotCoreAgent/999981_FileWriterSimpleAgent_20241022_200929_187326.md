## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the missing `active_creature` field in the Player model. The error occurs because the `Player` class is expecting an `active_creature` attribute, but it's not being set when creating a player from the prototype data.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional. This way, we can create a Player instance without immediately setting an active creature.

2. We'll update the `create_player` method in `main.py` to set the `active_creature` after creating the Player instance.

Let's rewrite the `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9834cf11-76c9-490a-b064-222582f91162
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, let's update the `main.py` file to set the `active_creature` after creating the Player instance:

# Excerpt ID: f2cc9ae6-49cb-427e-be5d-f71c3928a513
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes should resolve the ValidationError we were encountering. By making `active_creature` optional in the `Player` model and setting it after creating the player instance, we ensure that the `Player` can be created from the prototype data without requiring an `active_creature` to be specified in the JSON file.

This solution adheres to the guidelines:
1. All models still inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.
2. The classes in `models.py` remain pure data schemas without methods or properties.
3. We're working within the capabilities of the engine by using the existing `from_prototype_id` method and only modifying the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in the `App` class.

These changes should allow the tests to run without the ValidationError, and the game should now be able to create players and bots correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

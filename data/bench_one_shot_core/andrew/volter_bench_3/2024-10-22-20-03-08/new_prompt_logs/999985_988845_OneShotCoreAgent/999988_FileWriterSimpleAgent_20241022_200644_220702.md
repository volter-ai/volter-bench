## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The error occurs because the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. We'll make the following changes:

1. Add a loop in the `run` method that continues until the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends, transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
3. Ensure that all possible paths in the scene lead to either a scene transition or game termination.

These changes will ensure that the scene always ends properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ee510532-42cf-470b-b625-033e3a5230e2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in creature.skills]

        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
            return True

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` class should resolve the issue by ensuring that the scene always ends properly, either by transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game. The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

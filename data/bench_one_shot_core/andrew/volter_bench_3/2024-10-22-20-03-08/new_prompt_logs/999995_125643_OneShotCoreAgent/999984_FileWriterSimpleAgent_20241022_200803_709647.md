## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal.
2. Use floats for damage calculations and convert to integers only for the final damage value.

These changes will be made in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The models and overall architecture will remain unchanged, as these modifications only affect the battle logic within the MainGameScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene with the proposed fixes:

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The Resolution Phase now implements a random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal. This is done in the `_resolution_phase` method using `random.choice([True, False])` to determine which creature goes first when speeds are equal.

2. The Skill Execution now uses floats throughout the damage calculation process. In the `_execute_skill` method, we convert the relevant values to floats before performing calculations. The final damage is then converted to an integer using `int()` function, as specified in the original requirements.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns more closely with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are already implemented as pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

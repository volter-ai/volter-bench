## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions to fix them in the MainGameScene. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Equal speed resolution: I'll implement a random choice when creatures have equal speed.
2. Forced swapping: I'll add a method to handle forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.
3. Normal type neutrality: I'll explicitly handle the normal type in the type effectiveness calculation.
4. Damage calculations with floats: I'll ensure all damage calculations use floats before converting to integers.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

```

These changes address all the issues mentioned:

1. Equal speed resolution: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we now use `random.random()` as a tiebreaker when speeds are equal.
2. Forced swapping: We've added the `_check_and_force_swap` method, which is called after each action in the resolution phase. The `_force_swap` method handles the swapping process when a creature is knocked out.
3. Normal type neutrality: In the `_get_type_effectiveness` method, we now explicitly return 1.0 if either the skill type or defender type is "normal".
4. Damage calculations with floats: In the `_calculate_damage` method, we now use `float()` to ensure all calculations are done with floating-point precision before converting to an integer at the end.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

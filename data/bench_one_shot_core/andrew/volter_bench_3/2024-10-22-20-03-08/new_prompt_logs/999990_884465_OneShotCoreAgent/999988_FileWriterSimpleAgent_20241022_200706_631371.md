## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a check to see if the game should end (e.g., after a certain number of battles) and call `quit_whole_game` if necessary.

Here's the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_count = 0
        self.max_battles = 3  # Set a maximum number of battles

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly:

1. After each battle, it checks if the maximum number of battles has been reached.
2. If the max battles are reached, it calls `self._quit_whole_game()` to end the game.
3. If not, it transitions back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits in an expected manner, either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the whole game. This should resolve the test failures and allow the game to run correctly in both test and normal execution scenarios.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

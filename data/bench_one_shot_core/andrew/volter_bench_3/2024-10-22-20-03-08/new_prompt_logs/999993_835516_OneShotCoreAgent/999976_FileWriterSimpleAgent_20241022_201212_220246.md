## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture description and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Handling equal speed scenarios in skill execution order:
   We'll modify the resolution phase to randomly decide the order when speeds are equal.

2. Using float calculations throughout the damage calculation process:
   We'll ensure that all damage calculations use floats until the final step.

3. Implementing forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   We'll add a method to handle forced swapping after each attack.

These changes will primarily affect the MainGameScene, so we'll rewrite that file. Here's the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. It handles equal speed scenarios by randomly shuffling actions with equal speed in the resolution phase.
2. It uses float calculations throughout the damage calculation process, only converting to an integer for the final damage value.
3. It implements forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero with the `_check_and_force_swap` method, which is called after each attack.

These changes align with the architecture description and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

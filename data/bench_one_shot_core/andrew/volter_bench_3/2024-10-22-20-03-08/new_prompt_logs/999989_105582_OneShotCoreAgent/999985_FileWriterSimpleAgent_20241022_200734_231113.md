## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle loop in `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle loop to properly handle the end of the battle and trigger the transition.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and the game flow continues as expected. We'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement these fixes.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 7bf9bdc5-4c45-45ed-b6a6-7e2050bca283
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:

            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_turn(self):

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.creatures[0].sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method to ensure the scene always transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends.
2. Keeping the `battle_loop` method as a while loop that breaks when `check_battle_end` returns True, ensuring that the battle continues until one creature is defeated.
3. Maintaining the existing logic for battle resolution and creature interactions.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

The changes are consistent with the existing architecture and model structure, and they don't introduce any new methods or properties to the data models. The game flow should now work as expected, with battles concluding properly and returning to the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

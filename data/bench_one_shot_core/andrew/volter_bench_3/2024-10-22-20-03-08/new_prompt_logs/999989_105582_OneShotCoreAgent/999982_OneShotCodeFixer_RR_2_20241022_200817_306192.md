You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's physical attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to physical attacks.
- `sp_attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's non-physical attacks.
- `sp_defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to non-physical attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `is_physical` - A boolean indicating whether the skill is a physical skill or a non-physical (special) skill.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.

                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    # important to print how we exited the scene, for debug purposes

                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```






Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements. Here's the plan:

1. Update `models.py`:
   - Import necessary modules and annotations
   - Define `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes, inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`
   - Ensure proper ordering of class definitions to avoid circular dependencies

2. Create JSON files in the `content` folder:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Implement `MainMenuScene`:
   - Update the existing `main_menu_scene.py` to include the "Play" and "Quit" options
   - Implement the transition to `MainGameScene` when "Play" is selected

4. Create `MainGameScene`:
   - Implement the battle logic as described in the documentation
   - Handle player and bot turns, skill selection, and damage calculation
   - Implement the battle end condition and winner determination

5. Update `main.py`:
   - Register both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`
   - Ensure proper creation of players and bots

6. Create test files:
   - `test_main_menu_scene.py`: Implement random run tests
   - `test_main_game_scene.py`: Implement random run tests for the battle scene

Now, I'll proceed with writing out each file according to this plan.

These files implement the creature battler game according to the provided architecture and requirements. The game includes a main menu scene and a main game scene where the battle takes place. The models are defined as pure data schemas, and the game logic is implemented within the scenes. The test files use the HumanListener's random mode to perform random runs of each scene.

The `MainMenuScene` allows the player to choose between playing the game or quitting. When the player chooses to play, they are transitioned to the `MainGameScene`. In the `MainGameScene`, the player battles against a bot opponent using their creatures and skills. The battle logic includes turn-based gameplay, skill selection, damage calculation based on creature types and skill effectiveness, and win/loss conditions.

The `App` class in `main.py` sets up the game by registering the scenes and providing methods to create players and bots. The JSON files in the `content` folder define the prototypes for skills, creatures, and players, which are used to instantiate the game entities.

This implementation follows the provided guidelines, ensuring that:
1. All models inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
2. Data models are pure schemas without methods or properties
3. Models reference other models directly, not through string IDs
4. Game logic is contained within scenes
5. Scenes use transition methods to change between them
6. The `__str__` method of scenes shows all relevant content
7. Models are created using `from_prototype_id`
8. Bots are treated the same as players, using `create_bot` and calling `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` on them

The test files for both scenes ensure that the game can run through multiple iterations without crashing, using the random mode to make choices. This helps verify the robustness of the implementation and catch any potential issues in the game flow.

Role: user
Content: there was an issue [issue redacted] with the implementation, fix it

Role: assistant
Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle loop in `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle loop to properly handle the end of the battle and trigger the transition.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and the game flow continues as expected. We'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement these fixes.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method to ensure the scene always transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends.
2. Keeping the `battle_loop` method as a while loop that breaks when `check_battle_end` returns True, ensuring that the battle continues until one creature is defeated.
3. Maintaining the existing logic for battle resolution and creature interactions.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

The changes are consistent with the existing architecture and model structure, and they don't introduce any new methods or properties to the data models. The game flow should now work as expected, with battles concluding properly and returning to the main menu.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The code implementation has several discrepancies with the architecture description. The main issues are: incorrect damage calculation formulas, incomplete implementation of weakness-resistance factors, lack of explicit handling for Normal type effectiveness, battle end conditions not checked after each skill execution, and missing explicit win/loss messages. These issues are significant enough to consider the implementation as not fully aligned with the specified architecture.",
  "qa_result": "failed"
}



Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the specified architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Proposed fixes:

a) Damage calculation formulas:
   - Update the physical damage formula to: `[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`
   - Update the special damage formula to: `[raw damage] = ([attacker sp. attack] / [defender sp. defense]) * [skill base damage]`

b) Weakness-resistance factors:
   - Implement a complete type effectiveness chart including Normal type
   - Use a 2x multiplier for effective attacks and 0.5x for ineffective attacks

c) Normal type effectiveness:
   - Add explicit handling for Normal type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types

d) Battle end conditions:
   - Check for battle end conditions after each skill execution, not just at the end of the turn

e) Win/loss messages:
   - Add explicit win/loss messages when a creature's HP reaches zero

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class within the `main_game_scene.py` file. The models will remain unchanged as they are already correct data schemas.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed fixes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The damage calculation formulas have been corrected in the `execute_skill` method.
2. The weakness-resistance factors are now fully implemented in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, including all type combinations.
3. Normal type effectiveness is explicitly handled in the effectiveness chart.
4. Battle end conditions are now checked after each skill execution in the `execute_skill` method.
5. Explicit win/loss messages are added when a creature's HP reaches zero in the `check_battle_end` method.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure, and they don't introduce any new methods or properties to the data models. The game flow should now work as expected, with battles concluding properly and returning to the main menu.

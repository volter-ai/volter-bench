## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the `execute_skill` method of the `MainGameScene` class. We're treating the `defender` as a `Player` object when it should be a `Creature` object. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to access `defender.creatures`.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `execute_skill` method to expect a `Creature` object directly, rather than a `Player` object.
2. We'll update the `resolve_turn` method to pass the correct `Creature` objects to `execute_skill`.
3. We'll ensure that the `determine_turn_order` method returns the correct `Creature` objects along with the `Player` and `Skill` objects.

These changes will maintain the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the AttributeError.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e4577a32-e592-4de6-b74e-5c719e77026a

```

This updated implementation addresses the AttributeError by ensuring that the `execute_skill` method receives a `Creature` object directly as the defender, rather than trying to access `creatures` on it. The `resolve_turn` method has been updated to pass the correct objects to `execute_skill`.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure, and they don't introduce any new methods or properties to the data models. The game flow should now work as expected, with battles concluding properly and returning to the main menu without raising the AttributeError.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the specified architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Proposed fixes:

a) Damage calculation formulas:
   - Update the physical damage formula to: `[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`
   - Update the special damage formula to: `[raw damage] = ([attacker sp. attack] / [defender sp. defense]) * [skill base damage]`

b) Weakness-resistance factors:
   - Implement a complete type effectiveness chart including Normal type
   - Use a 2x multiplier for effective attacks and 0.5x for ineffective attacks

c) Normal type effectiveness:
   - Add explicit handling for Normal type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types

d) Battle end conditions:
   - Check for battle end conditions after each skill execution, not just at the end of the turn

e) Win/loss messages:
   - Add explicit win/loss messages when a creature's HP reaches zero

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class within the `main_game_scene.py` file. The models will remain unchanged as they are already correct data schemas.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed fixes:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The damage calculation formulas have been corrected in the `execute_skill` method.
2. The weakness-resistance factors are now fully implemented in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, including all type combinations.
3. Normal type effectiveness is explicitly handled in the effectiveness chart.
4. Battle end conditions are now checked after each skill execution in the `execute_skill` method.
5. Explicit win/loss messages are added when a creature's HP reaches zero in the `check_battle_end` method.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure, and they don't introduce any new methods or properties to the data models. The game flow should now work as expected, with battles concluding properly and returning to the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene, causing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

2. The random test runs are not properly triggering scene transitions or game quits, leading to assertion failures.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. Modify the MainGameScene to ensure that it always ends with either a transition to another scene or a game quit.
2. Adjust the game loop to handle the battle end condition more explicitly.
3. Ensure that the player and foe creatures' HP are properly updated and checked after each turn.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 2d6008ff-0b64-42fc-8136-04de9913d6ba
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.foe_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            if self.player_choice_phase():
                self._quit_whole_game()
                return

            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self.player_skill_queue.append(skill_choice.thing)
            return False
        elif quit_button == choice:
            return True

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        foe_skill = self.foe_creature.skills[0]  # Bot always uses the first skill
        self.foe_skill_queue.append(foe_skill)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        foe_skill = self.foe_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.foe_creature.hp = max(0, self.foe_creature.hp)

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop always ends with either a transition to another scene or a game quit.
2. Handling the player's choice to quit immediately, calling `_quit_whole_game()`.
3. Checking for battle end conditions after each turn and transitioning to the MainMenuScene when appropriate.
4. Properly updating and checking creature HP after each action.

This implementation should resolve the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error and ensure that the random test runs properly trigger scene transitions or game quits.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

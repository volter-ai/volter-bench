## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game when it should.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _check_battle_end method to return to the main menu when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the run method properly handles the end of the battle.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f051def2-a8ec-41d7-89be-640c706ece63
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `run` method to use a `battle_ended` flag to control the main loop.
2. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the scene properly exits and transitions when the battle is over, fixing the issues reported in the test failures. The scene will now either transition back to the main menu or quit the game (via the main menu) as expected, resolving the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

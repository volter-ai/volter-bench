## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Handling equal speed randomly:
   We'll modify the _resolve_turn method to use random.choice when speeds are equal.

2. Using floats for damage calculation:
   We'll update the _calculate_damage method to use floats explicitly before converting to integers.

3. Implementing 'Normal' type effectiveness:
   We'll add 'Normal' type to the effectiveness dictionary in the _get_type_factor method.

4. Explicitly checking if damage is at least 1:
   We'll add an explicit check in the _calculate_damage method.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3aa2000f-149a-42c0-870b-fe323499fec3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            creatures = [(self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, 2)

        self._execute_skill(*first, second[0])
        if second[0].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(*second, first[0])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Explicitly ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {},  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The _resolve_turn method now handles equal speed randomly using random.sample.
2. The _calculate_damage method explicitly uses floats for all calculations before converting to an integer.
3. The 'Normal' type is now included in the effectiveness dictionary, with an empty dictionary as its value to represent no special effectiveness.
4. The _calculate_damage method explicitly checks if the damage is at least 1 using the max function.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies between the implementation and the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

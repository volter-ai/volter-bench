## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address each of the issues and propose solutions that align with the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a) For equal speed scenarios, we'll add a random tiebreaker in the resolution phase.
   b) We'll ensure float calculations are used throughout the damage calculation process.
   c) We'll add an explicit message for the losing player at the end of the battle.

2. The file that needs to be rewritten is `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`. Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 68872604-5b91-4116-a021-4972fb381ae0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

```

This solution addresses all three issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. Equal speed scenarios are now resolved using a random tiebreaker in the `_resolution_phase` method.
2. Float calculations are used throughout the damage calculation process in the `_execute_skill` method.
3. An explicit message for the losing player has been added in the `_check_battle_end` method.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement an explicit state reset when leaving MainGameScene.
2. Add the missing Leaf type effectiveness in the _get_type_factor method.
3. Implement the behavior where a swapped-in creature gets hit by the opponent's queued skill.

These changes will be made within the existing architecture and capabilities of the engine. The models will remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. An explicit state reset is now implemented in the `_reset_state` method, which is called in `_end_battle`.
2. The missing Leaf type effectiveness has been added to the `_get_type_factor` method.
3. The behavior where a swapped-in creature gets hit by the opponent's queued skill is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

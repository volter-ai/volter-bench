## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and allows the game flow to continue.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the result message and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll call this method when checking for the battle end condition.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: fd8dbad9-17ed-4f34-b1c0-2ad1af7691b7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self, message):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This should resolve both issues:

1. The MainGameScene will now exit properly, either transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game.
2. The whole game flow should complete correctly, as the MainGameScene will no longer terminate without calling `transition_to_scene` or `quit_whole_game`.

By implementing these changes, we maintain the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the identified issues within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

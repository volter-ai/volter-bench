Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to restructure the MainGameScene to explicitly separate the turn phases into Player Choice, Foe Choice, and Resolution as described in the architecture. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll create separate methods for each phase: player_choice_phase, foe_choice_phase, and resolution_phase.
2. We'll modify the main game loop to call these phases in order for each turn.
3. We'll introduce a TurnAction class to store the chosen skill for each player during their choice phase.
4. We'll implement the speed-based resolution order in the resolution phase.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

This rewritten MainGameScene addresses the issue by:

1. Explicitly separating the turn phases into Player Choice, Foe Choice, and Resolution.
2. Implementing a TurnAction class to store the chosen skill for each player during their choice phase.
3. Modifying the main game loop to call these phases in order for each turn.
4. Implementing the speed-based resolution order in the resolution phase.

These changes align the implementation with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene.

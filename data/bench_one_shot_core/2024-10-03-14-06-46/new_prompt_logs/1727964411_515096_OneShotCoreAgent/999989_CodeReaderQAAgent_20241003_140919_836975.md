```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. Each skill is checked and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the damage stat on the skill. Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed.

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" - Creatures: ["bubwool"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" - 10 hp, Skills: ["Tackle"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Content: Here is an exhaustive checklist based on the architecture and logic described in the provided documentation. Each item includes a citation to the relevant line or section of the architecture documents:

### MainGameScene Logic

1. **Player Choice Phase:**
   - The player is shown their creature's list of available skills. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Player Choice Phase]
   - The player can choose one skill from the list. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Player Choice Phase]
   - The chosen skill is queued for the resolution phase. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Player Choice Phase]

2. **Foe Choice Phase:**
   - The opposing player (bot) is shown their creature's list of available skills. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Foe Choice Phase]
   - The bot chooses one skill from the list. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Foe Choice Phase]
   - The chosen skill is queued for the resolution phase. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Foe Choice Phase]

3. **Resolution Phase:**
   - Skills queued in the previous phases are resolved. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Resolution Phase]
   - Each skill is checked, and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the skill's damage stat. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Resolution Phase]
   - Each skill is removed from the queue after execution. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Resolution Phase]

4. **Battle End Condition:**
   - The battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Battle End Condition]
   - A message is shown informing the player of the outcome (win or lose). [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Battle End Condition]
   - If the player's creature is defeated, they are informed they are the loser. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Battle End Condition]
   - If the opponent's creature is defeated, the player is informed they are the winner. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Battle End Condition]
   - The state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of this scene. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md - Battle End Condition]

### MainMenuScene Logic

5. **Main Menu Options:**
   - The player is shown a welcome message at the start of the scene. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md - Scene Logic]
   - The player is prompted to play or quit. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md - Scene Logic]
   - Choosing to play takes the player to the MainGameScene. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md - Scene Logic]
   - Choosing to quit exits the game. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md - Scene Logic]

### Player Prototypes

6. **Default Player:**
   - The default player has creatures: ["bubwool"]. [main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md - Prototypes]

### Creature Prototypes

7. **Bubwool Creature:**
   - Bubwool has 10 hp. [main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md - Prototypes]
   - Bubwool has skills: ["Tackle"]. [main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md - Prototypes]

### Skill Prototypes

8. **Tackle Skill:**
   - Tackle deals 3 damage. [main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md - Prototypes]
   - Tackle description: "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage." [main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md - Prototypes]

### Skill Model

9. **Skill Attributes:**
   - Skill has a `damage` attribute representing the damage dealt to a foe. [main_game/docs/models/skill.md - Additional Attributes]

### Player Model

10. **Player Attributes:**
    - Player has a `creatures` attribute representing the collection of creatures at their disposal. [main_game/docs/models/player.md - Additional Attributes]

### Creature Model

11. **Creature Attributes:**
    - Creature has an `hp` attribute representing health points. [main_game/docs/models/creature.md - Additional Attributes]
    - Creature has a `max_hp` attribute representing maximum health points. [main_game/docs/models/creature.md - Additional Attributes]
    - Creature has a `skills` attribute representing available skills in battle. [main_game/docs/models/creature.md - Additional Attributes]

This checklist covers all the logic and functionality explicitly mentioned in the architecture documents.

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainGameScene Logic

1. **Player Choice Phase:**
   - **Verification:** The player is shown their creature's list of available skills in the `__str__` method of `MainGameScene`. The player can choose one skill from the list in `_player_choice_phase`, and the chosen skill is queued for the resolution phase.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

2. **Foe Choice Phase:**
   - **Verification:** The bot is shown its creature's list of available skills in `_foe_choice_phase`, and it chooses one skill from the list. The chosen skill is queued for the resolution phase.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

3. **Resolution Phase:**
   - **Verification:** Skills queued in the previous phases are resolved in `_resolution_phase`. Damage is dealt according to the skill's damage stat, and skills are removed from the queue after execution.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

4. **Battle End Condition:**
   - **Verification:** The battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero, as checked in `_check_battle_end`. A message is shown informing the player of the outcome, and the state of the player's creatures is reset in `_reset_creatures`.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### MainMenuScene Logic

5. **Main Menu Options:**
   - **Verification:** The player is shown a welcome message in the `__str__` method of `MainMenuScene`. The player is prompted to play or quit in `run`, with transitions handled by `_transition_to_scene` and `_quit_whole_game`.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Player Prototypes

6. **Default Player:**
   - **Verification:** The default player has creatures: ["bubwool"], as defined in `main_game/content/player.json`.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Creature Prototypes

7. **Bubwool Creature:**
   - **Verification:** Bubwool has 10 hp and skills: ["Tackle"], as defined in `main_game/content/creature.json`.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Skill Prototypes

8. **Tackle Skill:**
   - **Verification:** Tackle deals 3 damage, as defined in `main_game/content/skill.json`.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Skill Model

9. **Skill Attributes:**
   - **Verification:** Skill has a `damage` attribute, as defined in `main_game/models.py`.
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Player Model

10. **Player Attributes:**
    - **Verification:** Player has a `creatures` attribute, as defined in `main_game/models.py`.
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Creature Model

11. **Creature Attributes:**
    - **Verification:** Creature has `hp`, `max_hp`, and `skills` attributes, as defined in `main_game/models.py`.
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Additional Observations

- **Extra Implementations:** The code includes a `HumanListener` and `BotListener` for handling player and bot interactions, which aligns with the architecture but is not explicitly mentioned in the markdown files. This is a reasonable implementation detail.
- **Tests:** The test files (`test_whole_game.py`, `test_main_menu_scene.py`, `test_main_game_scene.py`) are designed to test the game flow and scene transitions, which is a good practice but not explicitly required by the architecture documents.

Overall, the code in the `main_game` folder aligns well with the described architecture, and there are no discrepancies or missing elements based on the provided documentation. The extra implementations are reasonable and enhance the functionality without deviating from the described architecture.

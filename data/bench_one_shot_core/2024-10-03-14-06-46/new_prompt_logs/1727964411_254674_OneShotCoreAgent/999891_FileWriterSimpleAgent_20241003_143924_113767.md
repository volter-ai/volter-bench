Content: Thank you for providing the additional information about the issues. I'll address these problems and rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to fix them. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:
   - Add a 'Back' button to the attack and swap choices.
   - Implement a loop in the player_turn method to allow going back to the main choice.

2. Handle equal speed with randomness in the Resolution Phase:
   - Modify the sorting of actions to use a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

These changes address both issues:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods. Players can go back to the main choice (Attack or Swap) if they change their mind.

2. The `resolve_turn` method now uses a random tiebreaker when sorting actions by speed. If two creatures have the same speed, their order will be randomized.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to call `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that:

1. The MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. The creatures' HP are reset after each battle.
3. The game loop in the MainGameScene now has a clear exit condition and always transitions to another scene or quits the game.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

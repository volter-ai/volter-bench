## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle end condition is not properly handled, leading to the scene terminating without the expected actions.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the battle loop continues until a winner is determined.
3. We'll add a method to display the battle result and transition to the main menu.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 1f80f00b-4d13-4cb8-a667-620bf6770d38
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._show_battle_result()
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, skill: Skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop continues until a winner is determined.
2. Adding a `_show_battle_result` method to display the outcome of the battle.
3. Transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends and creatures are reset.

This implementation should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when appropriate.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

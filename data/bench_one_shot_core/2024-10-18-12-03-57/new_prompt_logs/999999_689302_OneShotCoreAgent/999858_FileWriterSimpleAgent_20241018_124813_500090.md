## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Implement random turn order for creatures with the same speed.
3. Add forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.
4. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, which should remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Added a 'Back' option in the player choice phase, allowing players to return to the main choice menu.
2. Implemented random turn order for creatures with the same speed by adding a random tiebreaker in the action sorting.
3. Added forced swapping when a creature is knocked out in the `_resolution_phase` method.
4. Added a `_reset_creatures_state` method to reset the HP of all creatures when leaving the scene.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify any models. The `Player`, `Creature`, and `Skill` classes remain as pure data schemas in the `models.py` file.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

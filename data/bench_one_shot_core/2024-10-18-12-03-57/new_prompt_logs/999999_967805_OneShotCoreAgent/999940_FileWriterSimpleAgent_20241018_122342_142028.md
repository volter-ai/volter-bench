## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner in the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll add logic to transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Here's how we'll implement these changes in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c375e437-1e31-4e2f-8689-9ac7576fb64a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
                continue
            self._player_turn()
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
                continue
            self._opponent_turn()
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type)") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s turn!")
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Ensuring that the battle loop continues until the battle has ended.
3. After the battle ends, transitioning back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These modifications should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the random run test failure. The scene will now always exit either by transitioning to another scene or by the game being quit (although quitting is not implemented in this scene, it could be added if needed).

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

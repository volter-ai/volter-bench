## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in the MainGameScene continues until the battle is over.
3. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will transition to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: bfd370be-07b1-4432-a0e0-512a686ecbc0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
        self.battle_ended = True

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. We've added a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. The `run` method now continues the battle until `battle_ended` is True.
3. We've separated the `check_battle_end` and `end_battle` methods. `check_battle_end` now only checks if the battle should end, while `end_battle` handles setting the `battle_ended` flag and displaying the result.
4. After the battle ends and creatures are reset, we transition back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the game not handling the end of the battle correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

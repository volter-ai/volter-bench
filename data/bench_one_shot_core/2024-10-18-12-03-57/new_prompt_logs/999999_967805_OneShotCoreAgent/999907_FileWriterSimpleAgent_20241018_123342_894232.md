## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Handle the case where creatures have the same speed:
   - In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a condition to randomly choose which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.

2. Handle 'Normal' type interactions in the type effectiveness calculation:
   - We'll update the `get_type_effectiveness` method to explicitly handle the 'normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: 5b3f9c8b-7e13-437b-b9f2-3319a7d572b0

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `resolve_turn` method now handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly choosing which creature goes first.
2. The `get_type_effectiveness` method now explicitly includes the 'normal' type, which has no effectiveness multipliers against any other type.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture and handles all the required game mechanics correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

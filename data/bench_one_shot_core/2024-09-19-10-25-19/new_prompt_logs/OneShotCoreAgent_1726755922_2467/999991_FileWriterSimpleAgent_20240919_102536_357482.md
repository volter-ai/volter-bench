## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes:

1. Implement the random decision for equal speed in the MainGameScene.
2. Add an explicit welcome message in the MainMenuScene.
3. Remove the 'Play Again' feature from the MainGameScene as it's not mentioned in the architecture.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, I'll modify the resolution_phase method to include a random decision when speeds are equal.
2. In the MainMenuScene, I'll add a welcome message using the _show_text method at the beginning of the run method.
3. In the MainGameScene, I'll remove the play_again method and modify the game_loop to end after one battle, transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with these changes:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The random decision for equal speed is now implemented in the resolution_phase method.
2. An explicit welcome message is shown to the player at the beginning of the MainMenuScene's run method.
3. The 'Play Again' feature has been removed, and the game now transitions back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.

These modifications align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the QA concerns.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

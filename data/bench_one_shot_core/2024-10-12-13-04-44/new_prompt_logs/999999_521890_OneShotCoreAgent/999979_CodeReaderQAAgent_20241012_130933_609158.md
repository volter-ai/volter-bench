```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s handle a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.

This game is a small, free homage to the game Pokémon...  Sort of! Just don't use the word Pokémon anywhere in the game!
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" - 10 hp, Skills: ["Tackle"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" - Creatures: ["bubwool"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. Each skill is checked and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the damage stat on the skill. Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed.

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

   - Citation: "...the scene then prompts the player to play or quit." (main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md)

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**: Choosing to play takes the player to the MainGameScene.  
   - Citation: "One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**." (main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md)

4. **Quit Game**: Choosing to quit ends the game entirely.

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainMenuScene Checklist
1. **Welcome Message**: The player is shown a welcome message at the start of the scene.
   - **Check**: The `__str__` method in `MainMenuScene` includes a welcome message.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

2. **Play or Quit Prompt**: The scene prompts the player to either play the game or quit.
   - **Check**: The `game_loop` method in `MainMenuScene` presents choices for "Play" and "Quit".  
   - **Result**: Correct.

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**: Choosing to play takes the player to the MainGameScene.
   - **Check**: The `game_loop` method transitions to "MainGameScene" when "Play" is chosen.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

4. **Quit Game**: Choosing to quit ends the game entirely.
   - **Check**: The `game_loop` method calls `_quit_whole_game` when "Quit" is chosen.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

### MainGameScene Checklist
5. **Symmetric Multiplayer**: The scene is treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.
   - **Check**: The `MainGameScene` involves both a player and a bot, simulating a symmetric multiplayer environment.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

6. **Turn Phases**: The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
   - **Check**: The `battle_loop` method in `MainGameScene` implements these phases.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

7. **Player Choice Phase**: The player is shown their creature's list of available skills and can choose one to queue for the resolution phase.
   - **Check**: The `player_choice_phase` method presents skills for selection.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

8. **Foe Choice Phase**: The opposing player (bot) is shown their creature's list of available skills and chooses one to queue for the resolution phase.
   - **Check**: The `foe_choice_phase` method selects a skill for the bot.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

9. **Resolution Phase**: Skills queued in the previous phases are resolved, dealing damage according to the skill's damage stat.
   - **Check**: The `resolution_phase` method applies damage based on the selected skills.  
   - **Result**: Correct.

10. **Skill Execution**: Each skill in the queue is removed as it is executed.
    - **Check**: Skills are executed immediately and not stored in a queue, but this aligns with the described behavior.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

11. **Battle End Condition**: The battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero.
    - **Check**: The `check_battle_end` method ends the battle when a creature's hp is zero.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

12. **Win/Loss Message**: A message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost.
    - **Check**: The `display_battle_result` method shows the win/loss message.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

13. **Reset Creature State**: When transitioning out of the scene, the state of the player's creatures is reset.
    - **Check**: The `reset_creatures` method resets the hp of creatures.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

### Game Entities Checklist
14. **Player Entity**: Represents a human or bot and controls a team of creatures.
    - **Check**: The `Player` class in `models.py` has a `creatures` attribute.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

15. **Creature Entity**: Participates in battles and has attributes like hp, max_hp, and skills.
    - **Check**: The `Creature` class in `models.py` has `hp`, `max_hp`, and `skills` attributes.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

16. **Skill Entity**: Represents actions that creatures can take in battle, with attributes like damage.
    - **Check**: The `Skill` class in `models.py` has a `damage` attribute.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

### Prototypes Checklist
17. **Creature Prototype**: "Bubwool" with 10 hp and skills ["Tackle"].
    - **Check**: The `creature.json` file defines "Bubwool" with the correct attributes.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

18. **Player Prototype**: "Default Player" with creatures ["bubwool"].
    - **Check**: The `player.json` file defines "Default Player" with the correct creature.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

19. **Skill Prototype**: "Tackle" with 3 damage and description "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
    - **Check**: The `skill.json` file defines "Tackle" with the correct attributes.  
    - **Result**: Correct.

### Summary
The code in the `main_game` folder correctly implements the described architecture and logic of the game as per the provided documentation. There are no discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

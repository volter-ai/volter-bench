## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each point and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Equal speed handling: We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to randomly decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
   
   b. Damage calculation: We'll remove the minimum damage of 1 and strictly follow the formula provided in the architecture.
   
   c. Post-battle choice: We'll remove the post-battle choice functionality as it's not specified in the architecture. Instead, we'll end the scene after the battle concludes.

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to implement these changes.

Here's the updated `MainGameScene`:

# Excerpt ID: 87d24707-9c71-4b74-bcaa-022e5b00172a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():

        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, opponent: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]

        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed: randomly decide who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
                if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Handling equal speed in the `_resolution_phase` method by randomly deciding which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. Removing the minimum damage of 1 in the `_execute_skill` method, strictly following the damage calculation formula provided in the architecture.
3. Removing the post-battle choice functionality and ending the scene after the battle concludes by calling `self._quit_whole_game()`.

This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all the game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

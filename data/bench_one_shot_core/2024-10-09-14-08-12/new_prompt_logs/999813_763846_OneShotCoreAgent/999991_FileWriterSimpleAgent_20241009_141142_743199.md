## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not properly handling the end of the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the scene properly exits by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of the battle.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 23110082-2395-4770-ac01-dec97bb627f9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # After the battle ends, ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        self._post_battle_choice()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, opponent: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _post_battle_choice(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `_post_battle_choice` method that is called after the battle ends. This method gives the player the option to play again or quit the game.
2. Ensuring that the scene always exits properly by either transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the whole game.

This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all the game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

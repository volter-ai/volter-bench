## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix the issues:

1. In the `_calculate_damage` method, we'll use floats for all calculations before converting the final result to an integer.
2. We'll implement a forced swapping mechanism when a creature's HP reaches zero.

These changes can be made within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, which should remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: db7a76c1-8a21-410f-b35f-6ae6a8026e09

```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. The `_calculate_damage` method now uses floats for all calculations before converting the final result to an integer.
2. A new `_check_and_force_swap` method has been implemented and is called after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`. This method checks if the active creature's HP has reached zero and forces a swap if necessary.

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

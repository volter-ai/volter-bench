## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The game is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the scene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e0f80d0e-5169-4078-9225-107b82f7629a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. Modifying the `run` method to transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
3. Ensuring that the scene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene` at the end of the battle.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene now properly exits by transitioning to another scene, and the creatures' HP is reset after each battle, allowing for multiple battles to be played in succession.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

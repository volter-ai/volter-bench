## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The game flow is not properly handled, causing the whole game test to fail.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit is called.
3. Add a turn counter to prevent infinite loops in case of a stalemate.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8b7dd574-19b5-4732-b817-a4186cfebc18
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.max_turns = 50  # Prevent infinite loops

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            self.turn_counter += 1
            if self.turn_counter > self.max_turns:
                self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has gone on for too long. It's a draw!")
                break

            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.
2. Introducing a turn counter and maximum turn limit to prevent infinite loops in case of a stalemate.
3. Keeping the game loop running until a transition or quit is called, which resolves the issue of the scene terminating without proper exit.

These modifications should fix the failing tests and improve the overall game flow. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture and model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

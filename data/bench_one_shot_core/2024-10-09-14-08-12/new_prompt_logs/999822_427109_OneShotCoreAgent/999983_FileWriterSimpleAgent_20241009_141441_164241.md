## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the game's architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Proposed fixes:

a) Handle equal speed randomly in the resolution phase:
   We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to use random.choice when speeds are equal.

b) Explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the weakness calculation:
   We'll update the _calculate_weakness_factor method to include 'normal' type explicitly.

c) Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene:
   We'll add a _reset_creatures method to reset HP to max_hp for all creatures before transitioning.

d) Convert to integer for raw damage calculations:
   We'll modify the _execute_skill method to use integer calculations throughout.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. Equal speed is now handled randomly in the _resolution_phase method.
2. The 'normal' type is explicitly handled in the _calculate_weakness_factor method.
3. The _reset_creatures method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, resetting all creatures' HP to their max_hp.
4. Integer calculations are now used throughout the _execute_skill method for raw damage calculations.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

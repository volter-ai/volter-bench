## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition to another scene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a new method `end_battle` that will handle the end of the battle, showing the result and then transitioning to an appropriate scene or quitting the game.

3. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and if so, who won.

4. In the `run` method, we'll use a while loop to keep the battle going until it ends, and then call the `end_battle` method.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

        # Here you can add logic to transition to another scene or quit the game
        # For example:
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Transition back to the main menu
        # Or if this is the end of the game:
        # self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the main issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The `run` method now uses a while loop to keep the battle going until it ends, and then calls the `end_battle` method to handle the end of the battle.

The `check_battle_end` method now returns both a boolean indicating if the battle has ended and the winner of the battle. The `end_battle` method shows the appropriate message and then transitions to another scene (in this case, back to the MainMenuScene).

This should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene always exits in an expected manner.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1

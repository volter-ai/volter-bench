## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make the following changes:

1. Add the 'Tackle' skill back to the skill prototypes.
2. Adjust the skills assigned to each creature to match the architecture specifications.
3. Remove the extra skills and creatures that were not specified in the original architecture.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Update the `skill.json` file to include the 'Tackle' skill and remove the extra 'Leaf Blade' skill.
2. Update the `creature.json` file to adjust the skills for each creature and remove the extra 'Leafeon' creature.

Let's rewrite the necessary files:

# Excerpt ID: 1b36d256-9a6d-4c03-89db-c6073c98b3f4
```json main_game/content/skill.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "tackle": {
      "display_name": "Tackle",
      "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "normal",
      "base_damage": 3
    },
    "fireball": {
      "display_name": "Fireball",
      "description": "Throw fire at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "fire",
      "base_damage": 2
    },
    "lick": {
      "display_name": "Lick",
      "description": "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "water",
      "base_damage": 2
    }
  }
}
```

# Excerpt ID: 5c6727fb-0c84-49b7-b344-09a2d308c1fd
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water-type creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 10,
      "max_hp": 10,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 2,
      "speed": 4,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard",
      "description": "A fire-type creature",
      "creature_type": "fire",
      "hp": 11,
      "max_hp": 11,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 3,
      "speed": 3,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    }
  }
}
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. We've added the 'Tackle' skill back to the skill prototypes.
2. We've adjusted the skills assigned to each creature to match the architecture specifications:
   - Bubwool now has 'Tackle' and 'Lick'
   - Scizard now has 'Tackle' and 'Fireball'
3. We've removed the extra 'Leaf Blade' skill and 'Leafeon' creature that were not specified in the original architecture.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene.

No changes are needed in the `models.py` file or the `main_game_scene.py` file, as they already handle the data structures correctly. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method in `main_game_scene.py` will now correctly handle the 'normal' type skill (Tackle) by returning a factor of 1 for it.

These changes should resolve the discrepancies between the implementation and the original architecture specifications.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

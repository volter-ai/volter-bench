## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures of a player are either knocked out or already active, leaving no valid choices for swapping.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `choose_swap` method to handle the case where there are no valid swap choices.
2. If there are no valid swap choices, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. We'll update the `get_player_action` method to handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None`.
4. If swapping is not possible, we'll force the player to choose an attack instead.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices).thing
        self.execute_swap(current_player, new_creature)
        return True
```

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. If there are no creatures available to swap, the player will be forced to choose an attack instead. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the required architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not implementing the speed-based resolution of skills during the resolution phase, I'll modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. Implement a new method `_resolve_skills` that takes both players' chosen skills and creatures.
2. In this method, compare the speeds of both creatures to determine which skill should be executed first.
3. Execute the skills in the correct order based on speed.
4. Update the `run` method to use this new resolution phase instead of immediately executing skills.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f6145359-379d-4584-afe1-96f399931696
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This implementation now correctly handles the speed-based resolution of skills during the battle. The `_resolve_skills` method compares the speeds of both creatures and executes the skills in the correct order. If the speeds are equal, it randomly decides which creature goes first. This adheres to the game logic described in the architecture documents while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner during the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit after a battle ends. We'll transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle concludes, allowing the player to choose whether to play again or quit the game.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. After a battle ends (win or lose), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a short delay before transitioning to allow the player to see the battle result.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning or quitting the game.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ce2e2ccc-5582-4a88-b7cb-84fc2d6f9540
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        
        # Add a short delay before transitioning

                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

        if skill.is_physical:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5

        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True

            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends. The short delay allows the player to see the battle result before transitioning.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas, and it uses the proper transition methods provided by the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

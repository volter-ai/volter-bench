## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to properly end the game when the battle is over. The main problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, instead of just returning True when the battle ends, we'll call `_quit_whole_game`.
2. We'll remove the `return True` statements from `check_battle_end` and instead use a flag to indicate when the battle is over.
3. In the `run` method, we'll keep the game loop running until the battle is over, and then call `_quit_whole_game`.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_over = True
```

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly ends the game when the battle is over by calling `_quit_whole_game`. The `battle_over` flag is used to control the main game loop, and the `check_battle_end` method now sets this flag when the battle ends. This should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without properly ending the game or transitioning to another scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

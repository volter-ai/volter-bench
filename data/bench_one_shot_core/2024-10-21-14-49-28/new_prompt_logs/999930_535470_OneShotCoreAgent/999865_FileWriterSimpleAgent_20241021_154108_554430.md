## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll describe the necessary changes and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file. The changes will focus on implementing the missing features while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Add 'Back' option during player choice phase:
   - Implement a 'Back' button in the attack and swap choice menus.
   - Allow players to return to the main action selection menu.

b) Handle action order based on speed and prioritize swaps:
   - Collect actions from both players before executing them.
   - Sort actions based on priority (swaps first, then attacks based on speed).
   - Implement a tie-breaker for equal speeds using random selection.

c) Prompt for creature swap when active creature is knocked out:
   - After each action, check if the active creature is knocked out.
   - If so, prompt the player to choose a new active creature.

d) Reset player creatures' state when leaving the scene:
   - Implement a method to reset all creatures to their initial state.
   - Call this method when transitioning to another scene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. It adds a 'Back' option during the player choice phase.
2. It handles action order based on speed and prioritizes swaps before attacks.
3. It randomly decides action order if creatures have the same speed.
4. It explicitly prompts the player to swap creatures when their active creature is knocked out.
5. It resets the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The `Player`, `Creature`, and `Skill` models remain pure data schemas, while all game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make two minor adjustments to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Resolution phase with equal speeds:
   We'll modify the sorting of players in the resolution phase to include a random factor when speeds are equal. This will ensure that when creatures have the same speed, the order is decided randomly.

2. Damage calculation:
   We'll explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the `int()` function, even though Python was implicitly doing this before.

These changes will be made within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal: `key=lambda x: (x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random())`. This ensures that when creatures have the same speed, their order is decided randomly.

2. In the `calculate_damage` method, we've explicitly converted the final damage to an integer using `int(type_factor * raw_damage)`.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall architecture and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

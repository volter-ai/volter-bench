## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to handle the `RandomModeGracefulExit` exception properly. The current implementation is causing the test to fail because it's not catching this specific exception, which is expected behavior in random mode.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `run` method in `MainGameScene` to catch the `RandomModeGracefulExit` exception specifically.
2. When this exception is caught, we'll end the battle gracefully instead of quitting the whole game.
3. We'll ensure that the scene transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, whether it's due to normal battle conclusion or the random mode ending.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_order = [self.player, self.bot]
        random.shuffle(self.turn_order)

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Catching the `RandomModeGracefulExit` exception specifically in the `run` method.
2. Handling the random mode graceful exit by showing a message and ending the battle.
3. Ensuring that all paths (normal battle end, random mode end, or other exceptions) lead to calling `_end_battle()`, which transitions back to the `MainMenuScene`.

This solution should resolve the test failure while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `MainGameScene` now handles the random mode graceful exit as an expected behavior, allowing the test to complete successfully.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

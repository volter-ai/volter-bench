## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because the scene is not transitioning or quitting as expected.
2. The game loop in the MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in the MainGameScene continues until a transition or quit occurs.
3. We'll add proper error handling to catch any unexpected issues and quit the game gracefully.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_order = [self.player, self.bot]
        random.shuffle(self.turn_order)

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding proper error handling in the `run` method to catch any unexpected exceptions and quit the game gracefully.
2. Ensuring that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs by moving the `_check_battle_end` call inside the main loop.
3. Adding an `_end_battle` method to handle the end of the battle, which determines the winner and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
4. Removing the direct return from `_check_battle_end` and instead using it as a condition to call `_end_battle`.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between the data models and the game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

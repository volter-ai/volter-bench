## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is happening because the battle end condition is not properly handled. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game when the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_check_battle_end` method of MainGameScene, instead of just returning True, we'll transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll add a new method `_end_battle` to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition or quit.
3. We'll update the `run` method to continue the game loop until the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 76e0d7d3-4d24-4e8f-a0a7-776a427eb4ee
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(False)
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(True)
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self, player_won):
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You lose!")

        choices = [Button("Return to Main Menu"), Button("Quit Game")]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene always ends by either transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game. This should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without proper handling, and it should pass the tests now.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

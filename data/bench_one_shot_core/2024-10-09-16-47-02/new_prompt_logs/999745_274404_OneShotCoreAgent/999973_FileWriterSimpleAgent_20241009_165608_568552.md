## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make two minor adjustments to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. For the resolution phase, we'll modify the sorting of players to handle equal speeds randomly.
2. For the final damage calculation, we'll explicitly convert the result to an integer using the `int()` function.

These changes can be implemented without modifying the models or the overall architecture, and they stay within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting of players to use a tuple key that includes both the speed and a random value. This ensures that when speeds are equal, the order is determined randomly.

2. In the `execute_skill` method, we've explicitly converted the `final_damage` calculation to an integer using the `int()` function.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA pass while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and provide a solution that adheres to the given architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a) We'll update the weakness-resistance factor calculation to include the 'normal' type.
   b) We'll modify the damage calculations to use floats and only convert to integers at the final step.
   c) We'll implement random order resolution for equal speeds.

These changes will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file, specifically in the `_resolution_phase`, `_execute_skill`, and `_calculate_weakness_factor` methods.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 3c61b0c4-acd9-43ee-b97c-d804adec36e4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._show_battle_result()
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, foe_skill
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = foe_skill, player_skill
        else:
            # Random order for equal speeds
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, foe_skill
            else:
                first, second = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = foe_skill, player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {},  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues mentioned:

1. The `_calculate_weakness_factor` method now includes the 'normal' type, which has no effectiveness or ineffectiveness against any other type.
2. The damage calculations in `_execute_skill` now use floats throughout the calculation, only converting to an integer for the final damage value.
3. The `_resolution_phase` method now implements random order resolution for creatures with equal speeds.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. To handle the case where both creatures have equal speed:
   - In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to include a random choice when speeds are equal.
   - We'll use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first in case of a tie.

2. To show the welcome message explicitly in the `MainMenuScene`:
   - We'll add a `_show_text` call at the beginning of the `run` method to display the welcome message.

Now, I'll rewrite the affected files with these changes:

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the `resolution_phase` method now handles the case where creatures have equal speed by randomly choosing which creature goes first.
2. In the `MainMenuScene`, a welcome message is now explicitly shown to the player at the beginning of the `run` method.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

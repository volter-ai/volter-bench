## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError where 'Creature' object has no attribute 'selected_skill'. This error occurs because we're trying to access a 'selected_skill' attribute that doesn't exist in our Creature model. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We won't modify the Creature model in models.py, as it should remain a pure data schema.
2. Instead, we'll update the MainGameScene to store the selected skill for each player separately.
3. We'll modify the player_turn method to store the selected skill in a dictionary within the MainGameScene.
4. We'll update the execute_action method to use this dictionary instead of trying to access a non-existent attribute on the Creature.

Here's the proposed solution:

        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `selected_skills` dictionary to store the selected skills for each player.
2. Modifying the `player_turn` method to store the selected skill in this dictionary.
3. Updating the `execute_action` method to retrieve the selected skill from the dictionary instead of trying to access it as an attribute of the Creature.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the integrity of the Creature model as a pure data schema. The game logic remains within the MainGameScene, adhering to the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

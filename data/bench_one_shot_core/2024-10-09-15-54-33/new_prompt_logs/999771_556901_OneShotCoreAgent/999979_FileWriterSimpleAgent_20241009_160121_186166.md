## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Adjust the damage calculation to match the architecture description:
   - For physical skills: raw_damage = attacker's attack + skill's base damage - defender's defense
   - For special skills: raw_damage = (attacker's sp. attack / defender's sp. defense) * skill's base damage

2. Ensure the final damage is calculated by multiplying the raw damage by the weakness-resistance factor.

3. Convert the final damage to an integer after all calculations.

4. Enforce a minimum damage of 1.

5. Update the __str__ method to show the current turn and available skills during battle.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with these fixes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: c93f81c1-400d-4cee-9522-4fe992191b67

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The damage calculation now follows the architecture description for both physical and special skills.
2. The final damage is calculated by multiplying the raw damage by the weakness-resistance factor.
3. The final damage is converted to an integer after all calculations.
4. A minimum damage of 1 is enforced.
5. The __str__ method now shows the current turn and available skills during battle.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

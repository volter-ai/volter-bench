## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll modify the battle_loop to break when the battle ends and call the new end_battle method.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that handles the end of the battle, showing the result and providing options to return to the main menu or quit the game.
2. Modifying the `battle_loop` to break when the battle ends and call the `end_battle` method.
3. Ensuring that either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` is called at the end of the battle, which should resolve the test failures.

These changes should fix the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are already correctly implemented as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes on the MainGameScene, specifically the `turn_queue`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene doesn't terminate unexpectedly.

2. We'll remove the `turn_queue` attribute from the MainGameScene class definition and instead use it as a local variable within the `run` method. This will resolve the unserializable attribute warnings.

These changes will maintain the current architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. We've added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method to ensure the scene transitions properly after the battle ends.
2. We've removed the `turn_queue` as a class attribute and instead use it as a local variable within the `run` method, passing it to other methods as needed.

These modifications should fix the FixableException and remove the unserializable attribute warnings while maintaining the game's logic and adhering to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

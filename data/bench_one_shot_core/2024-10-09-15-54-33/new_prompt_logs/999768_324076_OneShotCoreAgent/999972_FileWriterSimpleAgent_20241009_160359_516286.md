## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make two modifications to the MainGameScene:

1. In the resolution phase, we need to add randomness when creatures have equal speed.
2. We need to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the int() function.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.
2. In the `_execute_skill` method, we'll explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using int().

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 606b9133-1489-4b17-9a79-5ba7a43ad73b

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The changes made to fix the issues are:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we modified the sorting key to include `random.random()` as a tiebreaker:
# Excerpt ID: bbea8751-ba1b-4e98-a627-e344c9b374ab
   ```python
   turn_queue.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] != "swap", -x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random()))
   ```
   This ensures that when creatures have equal speed, their order is randomized.

2. In the `_execute_skill` method, we explicitly convert the final damage to an integer:
# Excerpt ID: c3085f10-ee6a-47e6-812d-7175d9dd3b62
   ```python
   final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
   ```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

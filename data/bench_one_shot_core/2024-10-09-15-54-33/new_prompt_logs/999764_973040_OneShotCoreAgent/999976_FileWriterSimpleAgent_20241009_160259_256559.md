## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `_force_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs when there are no available creatures to swap to, resulting in `new_creature` being `None`. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_force_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures before attempting to swap.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll show a message indicating that the player has no more creatures to swap to.
3. We'll only perform the swap if a new creature is available.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by checking if there are available creatures before attempting to swap. If there are no available creatures, it shows a message and doesn't attempt to perform the swap. This should prevent the `AttributeError` that was occurring when `new_creature` was `None`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address both the speed tie-breaking and the welcome message display in the MainMenuScene. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. For the speed tie-breaking:
   - In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the resolution_phase method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed.
   - We'll use Python's random.choice to randomly decide which creature goes first in case of a speed tie.

2. For the welcome message in MainMenuScene:
   - We'll add a _show_text call at the beginning of the run method to display the welcome message.

Now, I'll rewrite the affected files with these changes:

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to Creature Battler")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            play_button = Button("Play")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [play_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if play_button == choice:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:

            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            creatures = [(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, k=2)

        self.execute_skill(*first, second[1])
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second, first[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, the resolution_phase method now handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly selecting which creature goes first.
2. In the MainMenuScene, we've added a _show_text call at the beginning of the run method to display the welcome message.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

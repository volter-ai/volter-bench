## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address these problems by modifying the MainGameScene in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Correct the damage calculation for special skills to match the architecture specification.
2. Add explicit handling for the 'normal' type in the effectiveness calculations.
3. Ensure damage calculations are performed with floats and then converted to integers as the final step.
4. Improve the battle end condition to clearly inform the player of their win or loss status.

Now, I'll rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: d4c0553a-82a4-4767-b72e-51edebc4a7ec
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
> {self.player_creature.skills[1].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"normal": 1, "fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"normal": 1, "fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has fainted. You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has fainted. You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation for special skills now correctly uses the ratio of sp_attack to sp_defense.
2. The 'normal' type is explicitly handled in the effectiveness calculations.
3. Damage calculations are performed with floats and then converted to integers as the final step.
4. The battle end condition now clearly informs the player of their win or loss status, mentioning which creature fainted.

These changes should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture and improve the clarity of the game's mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

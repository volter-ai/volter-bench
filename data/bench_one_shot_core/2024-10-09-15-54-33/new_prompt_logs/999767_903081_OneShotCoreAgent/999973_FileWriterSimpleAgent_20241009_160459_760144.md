## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is due to trying to import `create_from_game_database` from `mini_game_engine.engine.lib`, which doesn't exist there. Instead, this function is defined in the `models.py` file. Let's fix this issue while adhering to the guidelines and architecture.

1. To fix this issue, we need to:
   - Remove the import of `create_from_game_database` from `mini_game_engine.engine.lib`
   - Import `create_from_game_database` from `main_game.models` instead
   - Ensure we're not adding any methods to the model classes
   - Keep the models as pure data schemas

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b45c32a1-41f2-47ea-a39a-67d7826ce982
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill, create_from_game_database
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_player_creature()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            creatures = [(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, k=2)

        self._execute_skill(*first, second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(*second, first[1])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = int((attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        return final_damage

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        weakness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return weakness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_player_creature(self):
        creature_prototype_id = self.player_creature.prototype_id
        new_creature = create_from_game_database(creature_prototype_id, Creature)
        self.player.creatures[0] = new_creature
```

This solution addresses the import error by correctly importing `create_from_game_database` from `main_game.models`. It maintains the architecture and guidelines by:

1. Keeping the models as pure data schemas without adding methods.
2. Using `create_from_game_database` to reset the player's creature state, which aligns with the engine's capabilities.
3. Not modifying the model classes themselves.

This change should resolve the import error and allow the tests to run properly while maintaining the integrity of the game's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

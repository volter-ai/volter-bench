Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `test_main_game_scene` function in the `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the test is not properly handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception that is raised when the game ends. We need to catch this exception and consider it a successful test completion.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll wrap the `scene.run()` call in a try-except block that catches the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll consider the test successful if this exception is caught, as it indicates that the game has ended normally.
3. We'll also add an assertion to ensure that the battle count has reached the maximum number of battles.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 29eb026a-701c-4e54-9605-e89043de56cf
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    
    try:
        scene.run()
    except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
        # This exception indicates that the game has ended normally
        pass
    except RandomModeGracefulExit:
        # This exception is also acceptable as it indicates the random mode has completed
        pass
    
    # Assert that the battle count has reached the maximum
    assert scene.battle_count == scene.max_battles, f"Expected {scene.max_battles} battles, but only {scene.battle_count} were played"

    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing model structure. The test now properly handles the game ending exception and verifies that the correct number of battles were played.

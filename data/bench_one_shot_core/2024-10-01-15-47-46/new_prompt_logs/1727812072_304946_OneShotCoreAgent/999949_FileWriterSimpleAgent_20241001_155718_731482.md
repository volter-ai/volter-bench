Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions for both tests.

1. What went wrong:

For the test_player_wins_all_battles:
The test expected to find a "Lick" button after the first battle, but instead it found "Continue" and "Quit to Main Menu" buttons. This indicates that the battle ended after the first turn, which was not expected.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 6487674e-15d4-43f0-b2d3-b711468b1999
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Lick)
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Tackle), Button(Fireball)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
Bubwool used Lick on Scizard for 18 damage!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Bubwool used Lick on Scizard for 18 damage!'}
You won the battle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'The battle has ended.'}
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Continue), Button(Quit to Main Menu)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 1e03b050-d8a4-4c5b-af78-f2b24c712c16
```python
for battle in range(3):
    while True:
        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        lick_skill = find_button(choices, "Lick")
        runner.make_choice(lick_skill)
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that the battle would continue for multiple turns, but it ended after the first turn due to the high attack power we set for the player's creature.

For the test_player_loses_and_quits:
The test expected to find a "Quit to Main Menu" button after the battle, but instead it found "Tackle" and "Lick" buttons. This indicates that the battle didn't end as expected.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: a907e834-b4e2-4336-ba43-04cfcf29986c
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Tackle), Button(Fireball)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Fireball)
Bubwool used Tackle on Scizard for 3 damage!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Bubwool used Tackle on Scizard for 3 damage!'}
Scizard used Fireball on Bubwool for 2 damage!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Scizard used Fireball on Bubwool for 2 damage!'}
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: a027f5db-d9aa-4b7d-bda3-10951e3187e5
```python
# Battle end
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit to Main Menu")
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that the battle would end after one turn, but it continued because the player's creature wasn't defeated in one hit as expected.

2. Solution description:

For test_player_wins_all_battles:
We need to adjust the test to account for the battle ending after one turn. We'll need to check for the "Continue" button after each battle, and repeat this process for all three battles.

For test_player_loses_and_quits:
We need to adjust the initial stats of the creatures to ensure that the player's creature loses in one hit. We'll increase the opponent's attack and decrease the player's HP further.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

    assert scene.battle_count == 1
    assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0
    assert scene.opponent_creature.hp > 0
```

These changes address the issues in both tests by correctly following the game's logic and structure. The tests now accurately reflect the expected gameplay and should pass successfully.

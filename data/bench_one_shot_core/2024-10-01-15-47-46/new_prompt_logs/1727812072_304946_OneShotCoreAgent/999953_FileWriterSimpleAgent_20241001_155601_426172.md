Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions.

1. What went wrong:

For the test_player_wins_all_battles:
The test expected to find a "Lick" button after the first battle, but instead it found "Continue" and "Quit to Main Menu" buttons. This indicates that the battle ended sooner than expected, and the test is now at the point where the player is asked to continue or quit.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: d226c528-e670-4318-b384-b60bfe2a150d
```
You won the battle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'The battle has ended.'}
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Continue), Button(Quit to Main Menu)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 7ef9deae-8e8a-4690-b26a-f00dd6154e17
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
lick_skill = find_button(choices, "Lick")
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that the battle would continue for multiple turns, but it ended after just two turns.

For the test_player_loses_and_quits:
The test expected the opponent to make a choice first, but the game actually asked the player to make a choice first.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: d4af1ecc-9ae6-457f-bbbb-c35ea49f82b9
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: f222dc93-e7cc-4e1f-8ca2-035080374a91
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(opponent)
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that the opponent would move first due to higher speed, but the game still asks the player to choose first.

2. Solution description:

For test_player_wins_all_battles:
We need to adjust the test to account for the battle ending after two turns. We should check for the "Continue" button after each battle, and then start a new battle. We'll need to repeat this process three times to test all three battles.

For test_player_loses_and_quits:
We need to adjust the test to first handle the player's choice, then the opponent's choice. After that, we can check if the player lost and chose to quit.

The expected gameplay trace will change for both tests to reflect the actual game logic.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: a46b01ae-17ce-4ef3-8030-49d976e4a37c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    
    try:
        scene.run()
    except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
        # This exception indicates that the game has ended normally
        pass
    except RandomModeGracefulExit:
        # This exception is also acceptable as it indicates the random mode has completed
        pass
    
    # Assert that the battle count has reached the maximum
    assert scene.battle_count == scene.max_battles, f"Expected {scene.max_battles} battles, but only {scene.battle_count} were played"

    HumanListener.random_mode = False

def test_player_wins_all_battles(app):
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    player.display_name = "Player 1"

    opponent.creatures[0].speed = 5
    opponent.creatures[0].defense = 1

    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    scene.opponent = opponent

    runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
    runner.start_game(scene)

    for battle in range(3):
        # Player's first turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        lick_skill = find_button(choices, "Lick")
        runner.make_choice(lick_skill)

        tackle_skill = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle_skill)

        # Player's second turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        lick_skill = find_button(choices, "Lick")
        runner.make_choice(lick_skill)

        # Battle end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        if battle < 2:
            continue_button = find_button(choices, "Continue")
            runner.make_choice(continue_button)
        else:
            quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit to Main Menu")
            runner.make_choice(quit_button)

    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
    assert scene.battle_count == 3

def test_player_loses_and_quits(app):
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    player.display_name = "Player 1"
    opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
    opponent.display_name = "Player 2"

    # Modify player's creature (Bubwool)
    player.creatures[0].speed = 5
    player.creatures[0].defense = 1
    player.creatures[0].hp = 1  # Set HP to 1 to ensure loss in one hit

    # Modify opponent's creature (Scizard)
    opponent.creatures[0].speed = 10
    opponent.creatures[0].attack = 20

    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    scene.opponent = opponent

    runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
    runner.start_game(scene)

    # Player's turn
    choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
    tackle_skill = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
    runner.make_choice(tackle_skill)

    # Opponent's turn
    choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(opponent)
    fireball_skill = find_button(choices, "Fireball")
    runner.make_choice(fireball_skill)

    # Battle end
    choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
    quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit to Main Menu")
    runner.make_choice(quit_button)

    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
    assert scene.battle_count == 1
    assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0
    assert scene.opponent_creature.hp > 0
```

These changes address the issues in both tests by correctly following the game's logic and structure. The tests now accurately reflect the expected gameplay and should pass successfully.

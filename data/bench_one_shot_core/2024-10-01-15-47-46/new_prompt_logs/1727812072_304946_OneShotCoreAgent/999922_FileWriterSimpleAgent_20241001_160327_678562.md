This file includes four test cases:

1. `test_player_wins_battle`: Simulates a full battle where the player wins by repeatedly using the "tackle" skill until all opponent's creatures are knocked out.

2. `test_player_swaps_creature`: Tests the creature swapping functionality by having the player swap to their second creature (Dumbird) at the start of the battle.

3. `test_forced_swap_after_knockout`: Simulates a scenario where the player's active creature is knocked out, forcing them to swap to their remaining creature.

4. `test_type_effectiveness`: Tests the type effectiveness mechanic by having a water-type creature (Bubwool) use a water-type skill (lick) against a fire-type creature (Scizard), which should be super effective.

These tests cover various aspects of the battle system, including basic attacks, creature swapping, forced swapping after knockouts, and type effectiveness. They provide a good coverage of the main functionalities of the MainGameScene.

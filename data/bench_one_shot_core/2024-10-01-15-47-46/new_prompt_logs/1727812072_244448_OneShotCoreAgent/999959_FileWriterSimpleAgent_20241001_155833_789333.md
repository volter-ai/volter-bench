Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the random decision for equal speed in the resolution phase.
2. Reset the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll add a check for equal speed and use `random.choice` to determine the order of skill execution when speeds are equal.
2. We'll create a new method `_reset_creatures` that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP. We'll call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models or architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"

            f"Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:

            if self._check_battle_end():

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed, random order
            first, second = random.sample([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            ], 2)
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if second[3].hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(*second)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The random decision for equal speed is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method. When the speeds are equal, it randomly selects the order of skill execution.
2. The `_reset_creatures` method is added to reset the HP of all creatures to their max HP. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset when leaving the battle scene.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is kept within the scene class.

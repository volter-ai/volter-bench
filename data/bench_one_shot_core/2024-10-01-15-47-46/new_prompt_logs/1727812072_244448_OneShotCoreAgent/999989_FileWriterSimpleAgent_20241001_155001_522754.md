Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the infinite loop that's occurring in the test cases. The main problem is that the tests are not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that's being raised when the game ends. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the test files to catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception and break the loop when it occurs.
2. We'll add a counter to limit the number of iterations in case the `_QuitWholeGame` exception is not raised.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or the overall architecture. It simply improves the test cases to handle the game ending gracefully.

Let's rewrite both test files with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 0ef9fd7f-0fdc-4313-a351-745672bffc6d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    max_iterations = 100
    iterations = 0
    
    try:
        while iterations < max_iterations:
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
            try:
                scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                break  # Exit the loop if the game ends
            iterations += 1
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}")

    assert iterations < max_iterations, "The game did not end within the expected number of iterations"
```

# Excerpt ID: b5c3d530-d1ab-46b7-85af-3b3a94bedad3
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    max_iterations = 100
    iterations = 0
    
    try:
        while iterations < max_iterations:
            scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
            try:
                scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                break  # Exit the loop if the game ends
            iterations += 1
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"An unexpected error occurred: {str(e)}")

    assert iterations < max_iterations, "The game did not end within the expected number of iterations"
```

These changes should resolve the infinite loop issue in the test cases while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities. The tests now properly handle the game ending and will fail if the game doesn't end within a reasonable number of iterations.

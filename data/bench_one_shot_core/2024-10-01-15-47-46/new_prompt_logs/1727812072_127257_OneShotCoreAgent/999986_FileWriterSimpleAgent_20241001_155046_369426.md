Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address the following problems:

1. The tests are failing because they're not properly handling the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception.
2. The RandomModeGracefulExit exception is being raised when the random mode counter reaches zero, which is expected but not properly handled.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch and handle both AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame and RandomModeGracefulExit exceptions.
2. We'll adjust the random mode counter to ensure it doesn't reach zero too quickly, allowing for more comprehensive testing.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the current architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the test files with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: cc0fc182-2b0c-479b-abdc-fa1cbe755adc
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 1000  # Increase the counter to allow for more interactions

    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    
    try:
        scene.run()
    except (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame, RandomModeGracefulExit):
        # These exceptions are expected when the game ends or random mode finishes
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")

    # If we reach this point without any unexpected exceptions, the test is considered successful
    assert True
```

# Excerpt ID: 2db2ee0a-ca7c-4c54-9a52-73c5417cd28c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 1000  # Increase the counter to allow for more interactions

    scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
    
    try:
        scene.run()
    except (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame, RandomModeGracefulExit):
        # These exceptions are expected when the game ends or random mode finishes
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")

    # If we reach this point without any unexpected exceptions, the test is considered successful
    assert True
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Catching both AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame and RandomModeGracefulExit exceptions and considering them as expected behavior.
2. Increasing the random_mode_counter to 1000, allowing for more interactions before the RandomModeGracefulExit is raised.
3. Considering the test successful if no unexpected exceptions are raised.

These modifications should allow the tests to run successfully while still exercising the game logic sufficiently. The tests will now complete either when the game naturally ends (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) or when the random mode counter reaches zero (RandomModeGracefulExit), whichever comes first.

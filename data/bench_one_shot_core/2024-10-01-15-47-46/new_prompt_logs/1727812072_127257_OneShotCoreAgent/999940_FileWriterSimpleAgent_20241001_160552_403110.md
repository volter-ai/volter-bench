Content: I apologize for the oversight. Let's analyze the issue and provide a solution that adheres to the guidelines.

1. What went wrong:

The test_skill_execution_order_with_equal_speed test is failing because it uses a while loop, which is not allowed according to the guidelines. Additionally, it doesn't explicitly test each step of the battle sequence.

2. Describe solution:

We need to rewrite the test to explicitly check each step of the battle without using loops. We'll need to predict the exact sequence of events and assert them one by one. We'll also need to handle the random choice of which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        # Final check - one creature should be defeated
        assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0 or scene.opponent_creature.hp <= 0
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Removing the while loop in the test_skill_execution_order_with_equal_speed test.
2. Explicitly checking each round of the battle, including the random order execution.
3. Asserting the state of the creatures after each round.
4. Ensuring that the test ends with a transition to the MainMenuScene.
5. Checking that one creature is defeated at the end of the battle.

These changes should make the test compliant with the guidelines and properly test the skill execution order when creatures have equal speed.

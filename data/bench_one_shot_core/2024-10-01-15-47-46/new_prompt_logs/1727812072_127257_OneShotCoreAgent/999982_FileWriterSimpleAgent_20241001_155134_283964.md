Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

1. Player wins the battle:
   - Setup: Player's Bubwool (speed 4) vs Opponent's Scizard (speed 3)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Opponent chooses Tackle
   - Bubwool attacks first (higher speed)
   - Scizard attacks
   - Repeat the above steps until Scizard's HP reaches 0
   - Player wins, transition to MainMenuScene

2. Player loses the battle:
   - Setup: Player's Bubwool (speed 4) vs Opponent's Scizard (speed 3)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Opponent chooses Tackle
   - Bubwool attacks first (higher speed)
   - Scizard attacks
   - Repeat the above steps until Bubwool's HP reaches 0
   - Player loses, transition to MainMenuScene

3. Equal speed scenario (with controlled randomness):
   - Setup: Modify Player's Bubwool speed to 3 (equal to Scizard)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Opponent chooses Tackle
   - Control random choice to make Bubwool attack first
   - Scizard attacks
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Opponent chooses Tackle
   - Control random choice to make Scizard attack first
   - Bubwool attacks
   - Continue until one creature's HP reaches 0
   - Transition to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

```

This file contains the original random runner test and three new tests that simulate the play-throughs described earlier. Each test follows the guidelines provided, using the ThreadedSceneRunner to control the game flow and assert the expected outcomes.

Content: I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's analyze the issue and provide a correct solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the fact that both the player and the opponent need to make choices before the damage is applied. The test was expecting the HP to change after each player's choice, but in reality, the HP changes only after both players have made their choices and the resolution phase occurs.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this issue, we need to adjust our tests to match the actual game logic:

1. We should expect the HP to change only after both players have made their choices and the resolution phase has occurred.
2. We need to dequeue choices for both players in each round before checking the HP.
3. We should adjust the number of rounds in each test to achieve the desired outcome (win or lose).

The expected gameplay trace will change. We'll need to check the HP after each complete round (both players' choices) instead of after each individual choice.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: 430e0823-4c73-4946-8662-86266f3b0b15

    game_ran = False

    for _ in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
            game_ran = True
            break
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # Consider this a successful run
            game_ran = True
            break
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # Game completed successfully
            game_ran = True
            break
    
    assert game_ran, f"Game did not run successfully in {max_attempts} attempts"

def test_player_wins_battle(app):
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    player.display_name = "Player 1"
    opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
    opponent.display_name = "Player 2"

    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    scene.opponent = opponent

    runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
    runner.start_game(scene)

    for _ in range(4):
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(opponent)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == max(0, 10 - (3 * (_ + 1)))
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == max(0, 10 - (3 * (_ + 1)))

    assert scene.player_creature.hp == 1
    assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

def test_player_loses_battle(app):
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    player.display_name = "Player 1"
    opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
    opponent.display_name = "Player 2"

    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    scene.opponent = opponent

    runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
    runner.start_game(scene)

    for _ in range(4):
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(opponent)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == max(0, 10 - (3 * (_ + 1)))
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == max(0, 10 - (3 * (_ + 1)))

    assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
    assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 1

    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes ensure that the tests accurately reflect the game logic, where damage is applied after both players have made their choices in each round. The tests now run through the entire battle sequence, checking the HP after each complete round and verifying the correct transition at the end of the battle. The `max()` function is used to ensure that HP doesn't go below 0.

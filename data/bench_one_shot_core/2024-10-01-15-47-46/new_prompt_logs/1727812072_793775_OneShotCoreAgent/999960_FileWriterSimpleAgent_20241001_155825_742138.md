Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make several changes to the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix each issue:

1. Equal speed handling: We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to randomly determine the order when speeds are equal.
2. Resetting player's creatures: We'll add a method to reset creature states when leaving the MainGameScene.
3. Normal type handling: We'll update the _get_type_effectiveness method to explicitly handle the Normal type.

These changes will be implemented in the main_game_scene.py file. We don't need to modify the models.py file as these changes are related to game logic, not data structure.

Here's the updated main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now randomly shuffles the actions when speeds are equal.
2. A new `_reset_creatures` method has been added and is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The `_get_type_effectiveness` method now explicitly handles the Normal type, ensuring it's neutral against all types.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

Content: I apologize for the oversight. Let's analyze the error and provide a corrected solution.

1. What went wrong:

The error message indicates an ImportError:

# Excerpt ID: 22463196-3b05-43e7-b81b-9082cddc362c
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Player' from 'mini_game_engine.engine.lib' ([REDACT]/volter-monorepo/packages/mge2/mini_game_engine/engine/lib.py)
```

This error occurs because we're trying to import `Player` from `mini_game_engine.engine.lib`, but `Player` is actually defined in `main_game/models.py`. This is a misinterpretation of the game architecture in the test implementation.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to correct the imports in our test file. We should import `Player` from `main_game.models` instead of `mini_game_engine.engine.lib`. We also need to import `Creature` and `Skill` from `main_game.models`.

The expected gameplay trace doesn't change; we're just fixing the imports to match the actual game architecture.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the corrected test file:

```

This solution corrects the import statements and maintains the structure of the tests while adhering to the guidelines. The tests now explicitly go through each turn without using loops, and each test ends with a transition to the MainMenuScene as required.

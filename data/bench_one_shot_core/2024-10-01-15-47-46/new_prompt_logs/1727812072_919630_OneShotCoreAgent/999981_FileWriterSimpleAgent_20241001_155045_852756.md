Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the implementation:

Play-through 1: Player wins the battle
Setup:
- Create a player and a bot
- Set the player's creature's HP to 10 and the bot's creature's HP to 3
- Player uses Tackle (3 damage) in the first turn
- Bot uses Tackle (3 damage) in the first turn
- Player uses Tackle (3 damage) in the second turn

Steps:
1. Initialize the scene
2. Player chooses Tackle
3. Bot chooses Tackle
4. Resolution phase: Player's creature deals 3 damage, Bot's creature deals 3 damage
5. Player chooses Tackle
6. Bot chooses Tackle
7. Resolution phase: Player's creature deals 3 damage, Bot's creature is defeated
8. Battle ends, player wins
9. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Play-through 2: Bot wins the battle
Setup:
- Create a player and a bot
- Set the player's creature's HP to 3 and the bot's creature's HP to 10
- Player uses Tackle (3 damage) in the first turn
- Bot uses Tackle (3 damage) in the first turn

Steps:
1. Initialize the scene
2. Player chooses Tackle
3. Bot chooses Tackle
4. Resolution phase: Player's creature deals 3 damage, Bot's creature deals 3 damage
5. Battle ends, bot wins
6. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, let's write the tests:

# Excerpt ID: 4c52bddb-ccaf-40b1-bbe6-7f1e5c0eabc9
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_button

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100
    player = app.create_player("test_player")

    iterations = 0

    def count_iterations(scene_name, **kwargs):
        nonlocal iterations
        iterations += 1
        if scene_name == "MainGameScene":
            raise RandomModeGracefulExit()

    app.transition_to_scene = count_iterations

    try:
        app.run(player)
    except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
        pass

    assert iterations > 0, "The game should run at least once"

class TestMainGameScene:
    def test_player_wins_battle(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        player.display_name = "Player 1"
        bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        bot.display_name = "Player 2"

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = bot
        scene.player_creature.hp = 10
        scene.opponent_creature.hp = 3

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Turn 1: Player chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 1: Bot chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 2: Player chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 2: Bot chooses Tackle (but doesn't get to use it)
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 7
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 0

        # Check scene transition
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_bot_wins_battle(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        player.display_name = "Player 1"
        bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        bot.display_name = "Player 2"

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = bot
        scene.player_creature.hp = 3
        scene.opponent_creature.hp = 10

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Turn 1: Player chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 1: Bot chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 7

        # Check scene transition
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This implementation includes two tests:

1. `test_player_wins_battle`: Simulates a battle where the player wins by reducing the bot's creature's HP to 0.
2. `test_bot_wins_battle`: Simulates a battle where the bot wins by reducing the player's creature's HP to 0.

Both tests follow the play-throughs described earlier, setting up the initial state, simulating the turns, and checking the final state and scene transition.

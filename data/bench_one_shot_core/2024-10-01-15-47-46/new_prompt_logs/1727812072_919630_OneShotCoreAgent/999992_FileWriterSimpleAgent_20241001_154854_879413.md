Content: To fix the issue with the tests failing due to the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, we need to modify the test files to catch this exception. The tests are failing because they're not handling the game's graceful exit when the "Quit" option is chosen in the MainMenuScene.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify both test files (`test_main_game_scene.py` and `test_main_menu_scene.py`) to catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll add a counter to ensure that the tests run for a certain number of iterations or until the game quits.
3. We'll reset the `HumanListener.random_mode_counter` before each test run to ensure consistent behavior.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or the overall architecture. It simply adjusts the test files to properly handle the game's exit condition.

Here are the rewritten test files:

# Excerpt ID: 1e047361-d98f-4c08-9079-a81d85cab263
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    iterations = 0
    max_iterations = 10

    while iterations < max_iterations:
        try:
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
            iterations += 1
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            break
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            break  # Exit the loop if the game quits

    assert iterations > 0, "The game should run at least once"
```

# Excerpt ID: fdc68521-a09f-4f3e-b09f-5dad43c1bb4e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    iterations = 0
    max_iterations = 10

    while iterations < max_iterations:
        try:
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
            iterations += 1
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            break
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            break  # Exit the loop if the game quits

    assert iterations > 0, "The game should run at least once"
```

These changes should resolve the test failures by properly handling the game's exit condition and ensuring that the tests run for a reasonable number of iterations or until the game quits. The tests will now pass as long as the game runs at least once before quitting.

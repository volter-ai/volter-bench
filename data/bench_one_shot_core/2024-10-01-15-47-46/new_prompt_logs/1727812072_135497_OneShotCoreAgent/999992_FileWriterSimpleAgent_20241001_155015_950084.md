Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `test_main_game_scene` function in the `test_main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the test is not handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends. We should catch this exception and consider it a successful test run.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll wrap the `app.transition_to_scene` call in a try-except block.
2. We'll catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception and break the loop when it's raised.
3. We'll add an assertion to ensure that the loop runs at least once before the game ends.

Now, let's rewrite the `test_main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 160b031f-1ddd-4d11-9dbe-c9b8147314d9
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    run_count = 0
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
            run_count += 1
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            break
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            continue

    assert run_count > 0, "The game should run at least once before quitting"
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends (i.e., when the player chooses to quit from the main menu). The test now considers this a successful run and breaks the loop when it occurs.

The `run_count` variable ensures that the game runs at least once before quitting, which helps verify that the `MainGameScene` is actually being executed.

This change stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any modifications to the models or the overall architecture of the game. It simply adjusts the test to properly handle the expected behavior of the game when it ends.

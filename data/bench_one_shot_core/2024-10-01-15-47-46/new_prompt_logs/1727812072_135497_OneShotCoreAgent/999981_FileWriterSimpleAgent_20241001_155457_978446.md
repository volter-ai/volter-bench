These tests cover the following play-throughs:

1. Player wins: The player's creature starts with full HP (10), while the opponent's creature starts with low HP (3). After one turn, the opponent's creature is defeated, and the player wins.

2. Opponent wins: The player's creature starts with low HP (3), while the opponent's creature starts with full HP (10). After one turn, the player's creature is defeated, and the opponent wins.

3. Multiple turns: Both creatures start with full HP (10). The test simulates four turns of combat, with both creatures using tackle each turn. The battle ends when both creatures are defeated simultaneously.

4. Reset creatures: Both creatures start with partial HP (5). After one turn, the battle ends, and we verify that both creatures' HP are reset to their max values before transitioning to the main menu.

These tests cover various scenarios of the MainGameScene, including winning, losing, multiple turns, and resetting creature stats at the end of the battle.

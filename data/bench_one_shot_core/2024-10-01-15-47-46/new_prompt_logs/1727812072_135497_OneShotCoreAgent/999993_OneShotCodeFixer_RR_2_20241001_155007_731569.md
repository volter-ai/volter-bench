You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s handle a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.

This game is a small, free homage to the game Pokémon...  Sort of! Just don't use the word Pokémon anywhere in the game!
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. Each skill is checked and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the damage stat on the skill. Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed.

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" - Creatures: ["bubwool"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" - 10 hp, Skills: ["Tackle"]
```

Use the engine above to create a game based on the architecture markdowns 

The folder structure should be as follows:
- mini_game_engine
  - engine
    - lib.py (this is already implemented)

- main_game (all your files should be written here)
  - content
    - {model name}.json
  - scenes
    - {scene name}.py
  - tests
    - test_{scene name}.py
  - models.py
  - main.py (the entrypoint)

Relevant existing files (that you should rewrite if needed):
```python main_game/main.py
class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```
```python main_game/models.py
class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"


T = TypeVar('T', bound='AbstractThing')

def create_from_game_database(game_thing_prototype_id: str, game_thing_class: type[T]) -> T:
    """Takes in a prototype_id and uses the content JSON files to bootstrap a hydrated game entity"""
    return game_thing_class.from_prototype_id(game_thing_prototype_id)

```



Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation and then write the necessary files for the creature battler game. Here's the plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations
   - Define `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`
   - Ensure proper ordering of class definitions to avoid circular dependencies

2. Create JSON files for content:
   - `main_game/content/skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `main_game/content/creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `main_game/content/player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Implement `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Create `MainMenuScene` class inheriting from `AbstractGameScene`
   - Implement `__str__` method to display scene information
   - Implement `run` method with logic for playing or quitting

4. Implement `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Create `MainGameScene` class inheriting from `AbstractGameScene`
   - Implement `__str__` method to display battle information
   - Implement `run` method with logic for battle phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
   - Handle battle end conditions and transitions

5. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`: Test `MainMenuScene` using random mode
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`: Test `MainGameScene` using random mode

6. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register `MainGameScene` in the `App` class
   - Ensure proper scene transitions

Now, I'll write out each file according to this plan:

These files implement the creature battler game according to the provided guidelines and architecture. The game includes a main menu scene and a main game scene where players can battle against a bot opponent using their creatures and skills. The implementation follows the specified folder structure and adheres to the given guidelines for models and scenes.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again. We'll update the `run` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. This will ensure that the game loop continues properly.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends and we reset the creatures, we'll add a transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll also add a short delay and a message to inform the player that they're returning to the main menu.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Opponent's Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self._show_text(self.opponent, str(self))

            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        
        # Add a short delay and inform the player
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Returning to the main menu...")
        time.sleep(2)
        
        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")

        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp)
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. This maintains the game loop and prevents the scene from terminating without calling `transition_to_scene` again. The added delay and message provide a smooth transition for the player.

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `test_main_game_scene` function in the `test_main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the test is not handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends. We should catch this exception and consider it a successful test run.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll wrap the `app.transition_to_scene` call in a try-except block.
2. We'll catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception and break the loop when it's raised.
3. We'll add an assertion to ensure that the loop runs at least once before the game ends.

Now, let's rewrite the `test_main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    run_count = 0
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
            run_count += 1
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            break
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            continue

    assert run_count > 0, "The game should run at least once before quitting"
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends (i.e., when the player chooses to quit from the main menu). The test now considers this a successful run and breaks the loop when it occurs.

The `run_count` variable ensures that the game runs at least once before quitting, which helps verify that the `MainGameScene` is actually being executed.

This change stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any modifications to the models or the overall architecture of the game. It simply adjusts the test to properly handle the expected behavior of the game when it ends.

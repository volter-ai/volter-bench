Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. I'll add these tests to the existing `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file.

Play-through descriptions:

1. Player wins due to type advantage:
   - Setup: Player has Bubwool (Water-type), Opponent has Scizard (Fire-type)
   - Player chooses "Lick" (Water-type move)
   - Opponent chooses "Tackle" (Normal-type move)
   - Bubwool is faster, so it attacks first
   - Lick deals double damage due to type advantage
   - Scizard's Tackle deals normal damage
   - Repeat these choices until Scizard's HP reaches 0
   - Player wins, scene transitions to MainMenuScene

2. Opponent wins due to higher stats:
   - Setup: Player has Bubwool (Water-type), Opponent has Scizard (Fire-type)
   - Player chooses "Tackle" (Normal-type move)
   - Opponent chooses "Tackle" (Normal-type move)
   - Scizard is slower but has higher HP and defense
   - Both attacks deal normal damage
   - Repeat these choices until Bubwool's HP reaches 0
   - Opponent wins, scene transitions to MainMenuScene

3. Equal speed scenario:
   - Setup: Modify Bubwool's speed to match Scizard's (11)
   - Player chooses "Tackle" (Normal-type move)
   - Opponent chooses "Tackle" (Normal-type move)
   - Random choice determines who goes first (we'll control this with the mocked random module)
   - Both attacks deal normal damage
   - Repeat once more with player going second
   - Scene transitions to MainMenuScene (we don't need to play until the end for this scenario)

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

This file includes the original random runner test and adds three new tests based on the play-throughs described earlier. Each test simulates a different scenario in the MainGameScene, checking for player victory, opponent victory, and the equal speed scenario.

Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions.

1. What went wrong:

For the `test_player_wins` test:
The test expected the game to end after three turns, but it didn't. The captured stdout shows that after the third turn, the game is still waiting for the player's choice:

# Excerpt ID: 45b77f16-16f7-4b4c-9cd9-c5a031c6dc86
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle), Button(Quit)])
```

This indicates that the battle didn't end as expected. The test is expecting a scene transition, but instead, it's getting another choice request.

For the `test_player_loses` test:
The test sets the player's creature HP to 1 at the beginning, but after one turn, the creature's HP is still 10. This suggests that the initial HP modification didn't take effect.

These errors are caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the tests. The game is not ending as quickly as expected in the win scenario, and the initial state modification isn't working in the lose scenario.

2. Describe solution:

For `test_player_wins`:
We need to continue the battle until one creature's HP reaches zero. We'll need to add more turns and check the HP after each turn. We'll stop when the opponent's HP reaches zero or after a reasonable number of turns.

For `test_player_loses`:
Instead of modifying the player's creature HP directly, we should create a new creature with low HP and assign it to the player. This ensures that the low HP state is properly initialized.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1766a133-9976-44fe-9131-656bf3df45c5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_button
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This is the expected behavior when the game ends
            break

    # Reset the random mode after the test
    HumanListener.random_mode = False

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        player.display_name = "Player 1"
        return player

    @pytest.fixture
    def opponent(self, app):
        opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        opponent.display_name = "Player 2"
        return opponent

    def test_player_wins(self, app, player, opponent):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = opponent
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        max_turns = 10
        for _ in range(max_turns):
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(opponent)
            tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            if scene.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                break

        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp <= 0
        assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_player_loses(self, app, player, opponent):
        weak_creature = Creature.from_prototype_id("bubwool")
        weak_creature.hp = 1
        weak_creature.max_hp = 1
        player.creatures = [weak_creature]

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = opponent
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(opponent)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_player_quits(self, app, player, opponent):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = opponent
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes address the issues in both tests:

1. In `test_player_wins`, we now continue the battle for up to 10 turns or until the opponent's HP reaches zero. This ensures that we capture the entire battle sequence.

2. In `test_player_loses`, we create a new weak creature with 1 HP and assign it to the player, rather than trying to modify the existing creature's HP. This ensures that the player starts the battle with a creature that has low HP.

These changes should resolve the test failures while adhering to the guidelines and maintaining the integrity of the game logic.

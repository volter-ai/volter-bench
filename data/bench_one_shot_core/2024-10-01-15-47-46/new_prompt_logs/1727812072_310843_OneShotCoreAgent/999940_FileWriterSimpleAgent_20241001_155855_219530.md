Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Handle equal speed when determining skill execution order by adding a random tiebreaker.
2. Explicitly handle the Normal type's neutrality against other types in the type effectiveness calculation.
3. Reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class, which is responsible for the battle logic. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already correctly defined as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. We added a random tiebreaker in the `_resolution_phase` method when sorting actions by speed.
2. We explicitly handle the Normal type's neutrality in the `_get_type_effectiveness` method.
3. We added a `_reset_creatures_state` method that is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, which resets all creatures' HP to their max HP.

These changes maintain the separation of concerns and don't require any modifications to the models. The MainGameScene class continues to handle all the game logic, while the models remain as pure data schemas.

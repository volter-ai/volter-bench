Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Handle equal speed scenarios in skill execution order by adding a random tiebreaker.
2. Explicitly account for the Normal type being neutral against all other types.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class, specifically in the _resolution_phase and _get_type_effectiveness methods. We don't need to modify any models, as they are already correct and compliant with the architecture.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.
2. In the _get_type_effectiveness method, we'll explicitly handle the Normal type as being neutral against all other types.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. We've added a random tiebreaker in the _resolution_phase method when sorting actions. This ensures that when creatures have equal speed, the order is determined randomly.

2. We've explicitly handled the Normal type in the _get_type_effectiveness method, ensuring it always returns 1 (neutral) against all other types.

These modifications align with the architecture described in the documentation and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, maintaining their status as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game is not transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the run method of MainGameScene always ends with either a transition or quitting the game.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 91d0f55e-b1bb-4f10-9b61-659dba169a2e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            bot_skill = self.bot_choice_phase()
            
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        
        # Add a choice to play again or return to the main menu
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        main_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choices = [play_again_button, main_menu_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def bot_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp = max(0, self.bot_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} uses {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - bot_skill.damage)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a choice at the end of the battle to either play again or return to the main menu.
2. Ensuring that the `run` method always ends with a transition to another scene, either MainGameScene (to play again) or MainMenuScene (to return to the main menu).

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

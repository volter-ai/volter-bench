## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the issue of not explicitly removing skills from a queue during the Resolution Phase, we'll modify the MainGameScene class. We'll introduce a queue for skills and implement the removal of skills from this queue during the Resolution Phase. This change will align the implementation with the architecture documentation.

Here's how we'll implement this:

- Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the MainGameScene class to store the skills chosen by both players.
- Modify the player_choice_phase and bot_choice_phase methods to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
- Update the resolution_phase method to process skills from the queue and explicitly remove them after execution.
- Ensure that the queue is cleared at the end of each turn.

These changes will maintain the existing model structure and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the identified issue.

2. Rewritten file with the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.bot_choice_phase()
            
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        main_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choices = [play_again_button, main_menu_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if play_again_button == choice:

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def bot_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
        bot_skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp = max(0, self.bot_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} uses {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - bot_skill.damage)

        # Ensure the skill queue is empty after resolution
        assert len(self.skill_queue) == 0, "Skill queue should be empty after resolution"

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by explicitly adding skills to a queue and removing them during the Resolution Phase. The overall structure remains the same, and the changes are confined to the MainGameScene class, maintaining compatibility with the existing models and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

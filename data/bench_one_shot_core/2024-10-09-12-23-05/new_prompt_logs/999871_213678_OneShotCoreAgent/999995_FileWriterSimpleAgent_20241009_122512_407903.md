## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The game flow is not properly handling the end of the battle.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a short delay after showing the battle result before transitioning, to allow the player to see the outcome.
3. We'll ensure that the `run` method always ends with either a transition or quitting the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 302a2054-dc50-4baa-8b02-4c458c0b92bb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                time.sleep(2)  # Short delay to show the result
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1])
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1])

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + attacker_creature.skills[0].base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {attacker_creature.skills[0].display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle scene always ends by transitioning back to the main menu.
2. There's a short delay after the battle ends to allow the player to see the result.
3. The `run` method always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised in the QA/testing phase while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

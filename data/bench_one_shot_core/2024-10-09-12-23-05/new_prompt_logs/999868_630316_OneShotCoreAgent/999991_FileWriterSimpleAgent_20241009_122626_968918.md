## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I understand the issues raised and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix the problems:

1. Use the chosen skill instead of always using the first skill.
2. Remove the check for negative damage, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.
3. Correctly display available skills for both the player and the opponent.
4. Implement the transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends, as specified in the architecture.

I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to address these issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture.

# Excerpt ID: 199c4a39-f516-40f6-8f42-7f737df3a016
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1], first[2])

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. The chosen skill is now used in the `execute_skill` method instead of always using the first skill.
2. The check for negative damage has been removed from the damage calculation.
3. The available skills are correctly displayed for both the player and the opponent in the `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods.
4. The transition back to the MainMenuScene is implemented in the `check_battle_end` method after a battle ends.

These changes ensure that the implementation adheres more closely to the specified architecture and gameplay behavior while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Implement random execution order for skills when creatures have the same speed in the `MainGameScene`.
2. Add the Leaf type to the creature and skill prototypes in the JSON files.
3. Remove the Normal type from the skill prototypes to align with the architecture documents.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `main_game_scene.py` file, I'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method to use random order when speeds are equal.
2. In the `creature.json` and `skill.json` files, I'll add a Leaf-type creature and skill, respectively.
3. In the `skill.json` file, I'll change the "Tackle" skill from "normal" type to "leaf" type to remove the Normal type.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with these changes:

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `_resolve_turn` method in `main_game_scene.py` now uses random order when creature speeds are equal.
2. A new Leaf-type creature (Leafeon) and skill (Vine Whip) have been added to the respective JSON files.
3. The "Tackle" skill has been changed from "normal" type to "leaf" type, removing the Normal type from the game.

These modifications align the implementation with the architecture requirements and address the issues raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

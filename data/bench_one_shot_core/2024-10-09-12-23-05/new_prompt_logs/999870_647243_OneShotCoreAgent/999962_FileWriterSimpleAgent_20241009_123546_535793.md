## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I understand that we need to address two main issues:

1. Explicitly implement the reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Implement the behavior of the swapped creature getting hit by the opponent's queued skill.

Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the _reset_creatures method to explicitly reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp. This method will be called when leaving the MainGameScene.

2. We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to handle the case where a player swaps their creature. If a swap occurs, we'll immediately execute the opponent's attack (if they chose to attack) on the newly swapped-in creature before continuing with the rest of the turn resolution.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The _reset_creatures method now explicitly resets all creatures' HP to their max_hp and sets the active creature back to the first creature in the list for both the player and the bot. This method is called at the end of the game_loop, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

2. The _resolution_phase method now handles the case where a player swaps their creature. If a swap occurs, it immediately checks if the opponent chose to attack. If so, it executes the opponent's attack on the newly swapped-in creature before continuing with the rest of the turn resolution.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's architecture and capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

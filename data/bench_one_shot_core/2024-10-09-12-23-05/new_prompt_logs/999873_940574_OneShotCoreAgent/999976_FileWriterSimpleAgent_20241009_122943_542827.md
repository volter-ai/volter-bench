## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the _check_battle_end method returns True when the battle is over, and we'll use this return value to break the main game loop.

Here's how we'll implement these changes in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c6905d5a-6161-4225-a936-be0331b672c8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that:

1. The MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. The _check_battle_end method now returns True when the battle is over, allowing the main game loop to break and transition to the next scene.

These modifications should fix the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected, transitioning between scenes correctly and ending the battle scene appropriately.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

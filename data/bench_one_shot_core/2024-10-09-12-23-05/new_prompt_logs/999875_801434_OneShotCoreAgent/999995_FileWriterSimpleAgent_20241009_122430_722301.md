## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll also add a check to ensure that the game doesn't continue if a creature's HP drops below 0 during the resolution phase.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 96e3ca38-13f9-4095-aaab-a49ff0b466d5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            bot_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Transition back to MainMenuScene after battle ends

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Opponent used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp = max(0, self.bot_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {player_skill.damage} damage to opponent!")

        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, f"You used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - bot_skill.damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Took {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. We've added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method to ensure that the scene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now check if the bot's creature's HP is greater than 0 before applying the bot's skill damage to the player's creature. This prevents the game from continuing if a creature's HP drops to 0 or below during the resolution phase.

These changes should resolve the issue of the MainGameScene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which was causing the test failures. The scene will now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the game loop to continue as expected.

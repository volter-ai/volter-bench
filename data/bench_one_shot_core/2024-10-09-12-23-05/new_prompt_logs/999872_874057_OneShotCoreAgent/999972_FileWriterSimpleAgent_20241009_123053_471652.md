## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue raised during QA/testing. To fix this, we need to add messages informing the player whether they won or lost at the end of the battle, as specified in the architecture documentation.

Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. Modify the `check_battle_end` method in the MainGameScene to display the appropriate message when the battle ends.
2. Use the `_show_text` method to display these messages to the player.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture requirements.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1053c616-5a87-4d7a-8147-ac9113919d93
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.determine_first_attacker():
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def determine_first_attacker(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return False
        else:
            return random.choice([True, False])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by adding appropriate messages in the `check_battle_end` method to inform the player whether they won or lost at the end of the battle. The messages are displayed using the `_show_text` method, which is part of the engine's capabilities. This implementation now aligns with the architecture documentation and should pass the QA test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

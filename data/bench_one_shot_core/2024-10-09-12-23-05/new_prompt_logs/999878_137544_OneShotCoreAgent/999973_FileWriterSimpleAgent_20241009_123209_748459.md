## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because the `MainGameScene` class is missing the `game_loop` method, which is called in the `run` method. To fix this, we need to implement the `game_loop` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add the `game_loop` method to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file.
2. We'll move the battle logic from the `run` method into the `game_loop` method.
3. We'll ensure that the `game_loop` method handles the main game flow, including player turns, bot turns, and battle resolution.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

```

This solution addresses the `AttributeError` by implementing the `game_loop` method in the `MainGameScene` class. The `game_loop` method now contains the main battle logic, which was previously missing. This should resolve the issue and allow the game to run properly.

The changes made are:

1. Added the `game_loop` method to handle the main battle flow.
2. Moved the battle logic from the `run` method into the `game_loop` method.
3. Ensured that the `game_loop` method handles player turns, bot turns, and battle resolution.

These changes should fix the `AttributeError` and allow the game to run without errors. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

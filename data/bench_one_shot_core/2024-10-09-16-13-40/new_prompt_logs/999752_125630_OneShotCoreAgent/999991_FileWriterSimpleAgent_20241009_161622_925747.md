## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, I will modify the `_resolution_phase` method to randomly determine which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.

2. In the `MainMenuScene`, I will add a welcome message to be displayed when the scene starts.

Here's how I will implement these changes:

1. For the `MainGameScene`, I will update the `_resolution_phase` method to use `random.choice` when the speeds are equal.

2. For the `MainMenuScene`, I will add a `_show_text` call at the beginning of the `run` method to display the welcome message.

Now, I'll rewrite both files with the proposed solutions:

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `MainGameScene` now randomly determines which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. The `MainMenuScene` now displays a welcome message at the beginning of the scene.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the two issues raised: implementing random decision for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal, and removing the minimum damage enforcement. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class, we'll add a check for equal speeds and use `random.choice` to determine the order of skill execution when speeds are equal.

2. We'll remove the `max(1, ...)` function call in the `_execute_skill` method that was enforcing a minimum damage of 1.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: a396298b-1fc1-4ab3-a920-86a63e8430eb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            self._show_text(self.opponent, end_message)
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a check for equal speeds and uses `random.choice` to determine the order of skill execution when speeds are equal.

2. The `_execute_skill` method no longer enforces a minimum damage of 1. The `final_damage` calculation now directly uses the result of `int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)` without any minimum value enforcement.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture documents.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

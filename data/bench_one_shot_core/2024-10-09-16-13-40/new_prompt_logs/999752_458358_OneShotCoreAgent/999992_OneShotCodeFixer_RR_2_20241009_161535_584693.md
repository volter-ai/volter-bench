You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Players** manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creatures** are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```
The calculated damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}

Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements. Here's the plan:

1. Update `models.py`:
   - Import necessary modules and annotations
   - Define `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`
   - Ensure proper ordering of class definitions to avoid circular dependencies

2. Create JSON files for content:
   - `skill.json`: Define the "Tackle" skill
   - `creature.json`: Define "Bubwool" and "Scizard" creatures
   - `player.json`: Define "Default Player" and "Basic Opponent"

3. Update `main.py`:
   - Import necessary classes
   - Update `App` class to include `MainGameScene`

4. Create `main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement `MainMenuScene` with options to play or quit
   - Add transition to `MainGameScene` when "Play" is selected

5. Create `main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement `MainGameScene` with battle logic
   - Include player and foe choice phases, and resolution phase
   - Handle battle end conditions

6. Create test files:
   - `test_main_menu_scene.py`: Implement random run test for `MainMenuScene`
   - `test_main_game_scene.py`: Implement random run test for `MainGameScene`

Now, let's implement each file according to the plan:

```python main_game/models.py

This implementation follows the provided guidelines and architecture. The game now includes a main menu scene and a main game scene where players can battle their creatures against a bot opponent. The models are defined as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scenes. The test files use the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices and test the scenes multiple times.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The test for the MainGameScene is not capturing the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the game_loop method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll add a new method called end_battle to handle the end-of-battle logic and scene transition.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        # Add a button to return to the main menu
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        
        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Properly ending the battle and transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. Ensuring that the game loop exits correctly after the battle ends.
3. Adding a "Return to Main Menu" button to give the player control over when to transition back.

With these modifications, the MainGameScene should now properly exit and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Modify the resolution phase in the MainGameScene to handle equal speed creatures fairly.
2. Update the skill description in the JSON file to match the architecture document.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the resolution_phase method to randomly determine which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. We'll update the skill.json file to correct the description of the "Tackle" skill.

```json main_game/content/skill.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "tackle": {
      "display_name": "Tackle",
      "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "base_damage": 3
    }
  }
}
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the resolution_phase method in MainGameScene to handle equal speed creatures fairly by randomly determining which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. Updating the skill description in the skill.json file to match the architecture document.

With these modifications, the MainGameScene should now properly handle cases where creatures have equal speed, and the skill description in the JSON file matches the architecture document. This should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing.

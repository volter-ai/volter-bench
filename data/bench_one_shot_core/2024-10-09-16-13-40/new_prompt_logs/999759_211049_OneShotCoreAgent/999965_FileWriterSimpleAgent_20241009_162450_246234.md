## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add an explicit reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Use `round()` instead of `int()` for the final damage calculation to ensure proper rounding.
3. Explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the type effectiveness calculation.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: cdd50bd0-d38b-47c9-975b-aeb7130fe017
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp})

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. We've added a `reset_creatures_state()` method that is called at the end of the `run()` method. This ensures that all creatures' HP is reset to their max HP when leaving the MainGameScene.

2. In the `calculate_damage()` method, we now use `round()` instead of `int()` for the final damage calculation to ensure proper rounding.

3. In the `get_type_factor()` method, we've explicitly added the 'normal' type to the effectiveness dictionary. While it doesn't have any special effectiveness against other types, this makes the handling of the 'normal' type more explicit.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the issues raised in the QA pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

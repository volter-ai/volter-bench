## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, I will implement random decision-making for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal.
2. In the Player model, I will add the missing display_name attribute.
3. In the Creature model, I will explicitly define the max_hp attribute.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines.

Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: caec74b1-2ebe-487a-800e-88a7d03ff1f9
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    display_name: str
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement the random decision-making for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal:

# Excerpt ID: 2d4c3d7a-04a4-48fb-8ecb-4ce5c5a9d785

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            if random.choice([True, False]):

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. The Player model now includes the display_name attribute.
2. The Creature model explicitly defines the max_hp attribute.
3. The MainGameScene now implements random decision-making for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal.

The models remain pure data schemas without methods or properties, and all game logic is contained within the MainGameScene. These changes should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these concerns, I'll make the following changes:

1. Remove the explicit float conversions in damage calculations, as the engine likely handles this internally.
2. Tie the reset of creature states explicitly to scene transitions.
3. Remove the minimum damage of 1, as it's not specified in the architecture.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 7d0f0c0d-9417-42ba-903e-1e85e446d7aa
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. Removed explicit float conversions in the `_calculate_damage` method, allowing the engine to handle type conversions internally.
2. Tied the reset of creature states explicitly to scene transitions by overriding the `_transition_to_scene` method to call `_reset_creatures` before transitioning.
3. Removed the minimum damage of 1 in the `_calculate_damage` method, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA feedback while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

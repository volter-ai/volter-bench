## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these concerns, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the weakness-resistance factor calculation.
2. Use floating-point arithmetic for damage calculations to maintain precision, only rounding to an integer at the final step.
3. Remove the resetting of the opponent's creatures' state, as it's not specified in the architecture.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. Update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to explicitly return 1 for 'normal' type skills.
2. Modify the `execute_skill` method to use float calculations and round only at the end.
3. Update the `reset_creatures_state` method to only reset the player's creatures.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'normal' type by returning 1.0 for any 'normal' type skill.
2. The `execute_skill` method now uses floating-point arithmetic for all calculations, only rounding to an integer at the final step when calculating the final damage.
3. The `reset_creatures_state` method now only resets the player's creatures, not the opponent's.

These modifications maintain the separation of concerns, keep the models as pure data schemas, and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The changes are confined to the `MainGameScene` class and do not affect the models or other parts of the game architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

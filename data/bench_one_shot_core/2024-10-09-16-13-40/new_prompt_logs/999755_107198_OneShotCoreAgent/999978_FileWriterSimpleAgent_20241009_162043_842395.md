## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, I will add a method to reset the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the scene.
2. I will modify the damage calculation for special attacks to ensure float division before converting to int.
3. I will add a comment to explicitly document the handling of equal speed creatures.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the updated file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: a309afc6-7b02-4858-bdc9-b86190e2a762
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            # Ensure float division for special attacks
            raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The `reset_creatures_state` method is added and called before transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`. This resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent.
2. In the `execute_skill` method, the damage calculation for special attacks now uses `float(attacker.sp_attack)` to ensure float division before converting to int.
3. A comment is added to the `determine_order` method to explicitly document the handling of equal speed creatures.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue. The current implementation doesn't handle the requirement that swapped-in creatures should be hit by the opponent's queued skill during the Resolution Phase. Here's how I plan to fix this:

1. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to handle this requirement.
2. We'll create a new method `_execute_queued_actions` that will handle the execution of queued actions, including hitting swapped-in creatures with queued skills.
3. We'll modify the `_perform_swap` method to return the swapped-in creature, so we can use this information in the resolution phase.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Introducing a `swapped_creatures` dictionary to keep track of creatures that were swapped in during the current turn.
2. Creating an `_execute_queued_actions` method that handles the execution of queued actions, including attacking swapped-in creatures.
3. Modifying the `_perform_swap` method to return the swapped-in creature.
4. Updating the `_perform_attack` method to take a specific defender creature as an argument, allowing it to target swapped-in creatures.

These changes ensure that swapped-in creatures are hit by the opponent's queued skill during the Resolution Phase, while maintaining the overall structure and logic of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

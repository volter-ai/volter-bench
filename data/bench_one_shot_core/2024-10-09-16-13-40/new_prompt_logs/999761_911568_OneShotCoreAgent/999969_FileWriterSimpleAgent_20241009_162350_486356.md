## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes:

1. Add a method to reset the creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Use a more precise rounding method for the final damage calculation.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. I'll add a `reset_creatures_state` method to the MainGameScene class. This method will be called when the battle ends and before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. For the damage calculation, I'll use the `round()` function instead of `int()` to ensure more precise rounding.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with these changes:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `reset_creatures_state` method is now called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their max HP.
2. The `calculate_damage` method now uses `round()` instead of `int()` for a more precise damage calculation.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as a pure data schema, while the game logic for resetting creature states and calculating damage is handled in the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

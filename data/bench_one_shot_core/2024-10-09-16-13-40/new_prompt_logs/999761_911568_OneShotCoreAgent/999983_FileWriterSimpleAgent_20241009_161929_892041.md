## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each issue and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Proposed fixes:

a) Implement random execution order for skills when creature speeds are equal:
   We'll modify the resolution_phase method to use random.choice when speeds are equal.

b) Add 'Leaf' type to creatures and skills:
   We'll update the JSON files to include a leaf-type creature and skill.

c) Utilize the description field for skills:
   We'll modify the MainGameScene to display skill descriptions when choosing skills.

d) Remove the minimum damage of 1:
   We'll revert to the original damage calculation without enforcing a minimum.

2. Rewriting the necessary files:

We need to update three files: `main_game_scene.py`, `creature.json`, and `skill.json`. Here are the updated files:

    }
  }
}
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. Random execution order for skills when creature speeds are equal is now implemented in the `resolution_phase` method.
2. A new 'Leaf' type creature (Leafeon) and skill (Leaf Blade) have been added to the respective JSON files.
3. Skill descriptions are now displayed when choosing skills and are utilized in the code.
4. The minimum damage of 1 has been removed from the damage calculation.

These modifications should resolve the issues while adhering to the architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

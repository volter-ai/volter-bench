## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of skill queuing in the Resolution Phase, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to include explicit skill queuing and dequeuing. Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the queued skills.
2. Modify the `player_turn` and `foe_turn` methods to queue the selected skills instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the `resolve_turn` method to dequeue and execute the skills from the `skill_queue`.

This approach will align the implementation more closely with the architecture's requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f0e81f6c-c6ab-42be-a1ef-0cfa1a3daede
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.foe_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolve_turn(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self.foe_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                self._show_text(self.foe, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            else:
                self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by explicitly queuing skills during the player and foe turns, and then dequeuing and executing them during the resolution phase. The `skill_queue` is implemented as a list, which allows for easy addition and removal of skills. This change brings the implementation in line with the architecture's requirements while maintaining the overall functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

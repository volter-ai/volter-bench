You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation and then write the necessary files for the creature battler game.

Plan:

1. Update `models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations
   - Define Skill, Creature, and Player models inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
   - Ensure proper ordering of model definitions to avoid circular dependencies

2. Create JSON files for content:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Update `main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement the logic for playing or quitting the game
   - Use `_transition_to_scene` to move to the MainGameScene

4. Create `main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement the battle logic with phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
   - Handle creature swapping and battle end conditions
   - Use `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` for both human and bot players

5. Update `main.py`:
   - Register both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene
   - Implement create_player and create_bot methods

6. Create test files:
   - `test_main_menu_scene.py`: Implement random run test
   - `test_main_game_scene.py`: Implement random run test

Now, I'll write out each file according to this plan:

This completes the implementation of the creature battler game based on the provided architecture and guidelines. The game now includes:

1. A `models.py` file with Skill, Creature, and Player models.
2. JSON files for skill, creature, and player prototypes.
3. A MainMenuScene that allows players to start the game or quit.
4. A MainGameScene that implements the battle logic with phases for player choice, bot choice, and resolution.
5. An updated `main.py` file that registers both scenes and implements player and bot creation.
6. Test files for both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene that use random runs to ensure the scenes function correctly.

The implementation follows the provided guidelines, including using `from_prototype_id` for model creation, treating bots the same as players, and using `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` for both human and bot players. The scene `__str__` methods provide all necessary information for navigation, and the test scenes use HumanListener's random mode to make random choices.

Role: user
Content: there was an issue [issue redacted] with the implementation, fix it

Role: assistant
Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the missing `active_creature` field in the Player model. The error occurs because the `Player` class is expecting an `active_creature` attribute, but it's not being provided when creating a player from the prototype.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional. This way, we can create a player without specifying an active creature initially.

2. We'll update the `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

Let's rewrite the `models.py` file with this fix:

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional by setting its default value to `None`. This allows us to create a `Player` instance without specifying an `active_creature` initially.

Now, we need to update the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` at the start of the battle. Let's modify the `_initialize_battle` method in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self._show_text(self.bot, f"{self.bot.display_name} sends out {self.bot.active_creature.display_name}!")

    # ... (keep the rest of the class implementation)
```

These changes should resolve the `ValidationError` we were encountering. The `Player` can now be created without an `active_creature`, and we set it at the beginning of the battle in the `MainGameScene`.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between the data models and the game logic. The `models.py` file remains a pure data schema, and the game logic for initializing the battle is kept in the appropriate scene.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not properly exiting, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The random run test for `MainGameScene` is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to properly exit after the battle ends. We'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle concludes.

2. We'll adjust the `_end_battle` method to ensure it always transitions to the `MainMenuScene`, regardless of how the battle ends.

3. We'll increase the `random_mode_counter` in the test to ensure it has enough iterations to complete a battle.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

Now, let's update the test file to increase the `random_mode_counter`:

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Increased to 100 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. The `MainGameScene` now properly exits by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. The `_end_battle` method always transitions to the `MainMenuScene`, ensuring the scene exits correctly.
3. The random run test for `MainGameScene` now has a higher `random_mode_counter` (100 instead of 30), giving it more chances to complete a battle and exit properly.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between the data models and the game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as a pure data schema.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the problem where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `_player_choice_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class, specifically when trying to swap creatures. The error occurs because all creatures are either the active creature or have zero HP, resulting in an empty list of choices.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to handle the case where there are no available creatures to swap.
2. If there are no creatures available to swap, we'll only present the "Attack" option.
3. We'll add a check to ensure that the player always has at least one creature with HP > 0.

These changes address the issue by:

1. Modifying the `_player_choice_phase` method to always include the "Attack" option.
2. Only including the "Swap" option if there are available creatures to swap to.
3. Ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between the data models and the game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as a pure data schema.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The implementation has several discrepancies with the described architecture: the 'Back' option is missing from the Player Choice Phase, equal speed scenarios are not handled in the Resolution Phase, the conversion from float to integer in damage calculation is implicit rather than explicit, and forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is not implemented.",

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Implement random selection for equal speed scenarios in the Resolution Phase.
3. Make the conversion from float to integer explicit in damage calculation.
4. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The 'Back' option is now included in both the main choice phase and the sub-choice phases (Attack and Swap).
2. Equal speed scenarios are now handled by randomly shuffling the actions when speeds are equal.
3. The conversion from float to integer in damage calculation is now explicit.
4. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is now implemented in the `_check_forced_swap` method, which is called after each action in the resolution phase.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between data models and game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as it already contains pure data schemas.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is causing the FixableException to be raised.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until a battle end condition is met.
2. When the battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` instead of just breaking the loop.
3. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 14ec5fb3-6b2d-49d6-b687-de3cc0307986

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `run` method to continue the game loop until the battle ends.
2. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.
3. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to restore all creatures' HP to their maximum values after the battle ends.

These changes ensure that the scene doesn't terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which resolves the FixableException. The game will now properly cycle between the main menu and battles, allowing for multiple playthroughs without errors.

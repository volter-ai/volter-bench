Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle is ending without proper scene transition or game termination.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b16d7e50-1409-4c16-95c9-55d9afc6f37e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.handle_battle_end()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self, opponent: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. In `handle_battle_end`, we give the player a choice to play again or quit.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
4. We've also modified the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean, making it easier to use in the main game loop.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve the issues raised in the QA/testing phase.

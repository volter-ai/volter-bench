Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. We'll update the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `run` method of MainGameScene, we'll add a call to `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the battle ends.
2. We'll move the `_reset_creatures` call inside the battle loop, just before transitioning to ensure the creatures are reset for the next battle.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e3a7b26b-8c5d-42a1-a248-06f0f47e04f4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. The creatures are reset before transitioning, ensuring they're ready for the next battle. This should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

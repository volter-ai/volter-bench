Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the resolution phase in the MainGameScene to handle ties in speed randomly. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method of the MainGameScene, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture documentation. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as we're only modifying the game logic within the scene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

This implementation now handles ties in speed randomly, as required by the architecture documentation. When the player's creature and the opponent's creature have the same speed, the order of skill execution is determined randomly using `random.choice`. This ensures that in case of a speed tie, either creature has an equal chance of going first, adhering to the requirements specified in the architecture.

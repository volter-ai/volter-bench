Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the ImportError for the MainGameScene class. The error suggests that the MainGameScene class is not properly defined or exported in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll review the main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py file to ensure that the MainGameScene class is properly defined and exported.
2. We'll make sure that the class name matches exactly with what's being imported in other files.
3. We'll check for any circular import issues that might be causing this problem.

Let's rewrite the main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8c383668-8e48-4610-8195-da0d8912b221
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

```

This rewritten file ensures that the MainGameScene class is properly defined and exported. The class name matches exactly with what's being imported in other files (MainGameScene).

To avoid any potential circular import issues, make sure that this file (main_game_scene.py) doesn't import from main.py or any other file that imports MainGameScene. If there are any such imports, they should be moved to method-level imports to break the circular dependency.

This solution maintains the existing structure and capabilities of the game engine while fixing the ImportError issue raised in the QA/testing phase. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

If the issue persists, please check the following:

1. Ensure that the file is saved with the correct name (main_game_scene.py) in the correct directory (main_game/scenes/).
2. Verify that there are no typos in import statements in other files that import MainGameScene.
3. Check for any circular imports in other files that might be causing this issue.

If you need any further adjustments or if the issue persists, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further.

Content: I understand the issue. The current implementation doesn't handle speed ties randomly in the resolution phase, which is a discrepancy from the described architecture. Here's how I'll fix this issue:

1. In the `MainGameScene` class, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to handle speed ties randomly.
2. I'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly select which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
3. This change will not require any modifications to the models, as it's purely a logic change within the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 89ff9877-cc29-4f87-9d87-627da6dd50af
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Speed tie, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            ])
            second_attacker = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill) if first_attacker[0] == self.opponent else (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)

            self.execute_skill(first_attacker[0], first_attacker[1], first_attacker[2], second_attacker[1])
            if second_attacker[1].hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker[0], second_attacker[1], second_attacker[2], first_attacker[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to handle speed ties randomly. When the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal, the code now uses `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first. This change ensures that the implementation matches the described architecture and handles speed ties as expected.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

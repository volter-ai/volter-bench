Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until a transition or quit occurs.
3. We'll ensure that after displaying the battle result, we transition to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 803f21ef-5695-4eed-8d31-c15c2ab917bb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def _transition_to_main_menu(self):
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the game loop until the battle ends.
3. Adding a `_show_battle_result` method to display the outcome of the battle.
4. Adding a `_transition_to_main_menu` method to reset the creatures and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing phase. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `transition_to_scene`, and it will properly exit the game loop when the battle is over.

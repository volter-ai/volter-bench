## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and allows the game flow to continue.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended.
2. In the main game loop, we'll check if the battle has ended after each round.
3. If the battle has ended, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: acdcfe7b-a662-46d5-aa79-b03b66ae9655
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False
        self.winner = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent.display_name} appeared!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            self.battle_round()
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
        self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.battle_ended:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self.get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        attacker_player = self.player if attacker == self.player_creature else self.opponent
        defender_player = self.opponent if attacker == self.player_creature else self.player

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_player.display_name}'s {attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_player.display_name}'s {defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

        if defender.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_player.display_name}'s {defender.display_name} fainted!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            self.winner = attacker_player

    def get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This should fix both the random run test for the MainGameScene and the full game flow test.

The main changes are:

1. Added `battle_ended` and `winner` attributes to track the battle state.
2. Modified the `run` method to continue the battle until it ends, then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. Updated the `execute_skill` method to set `battle_ended` and `winner` when a creature faints.
4. Removed the return statements from `resolution_phase` and `execute_skill` to ensure the game loop continues until explicitly ended.

These modifications should allow the scene to exit properly and the game flow to continue as expected, resolving the test failures.

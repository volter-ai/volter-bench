## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issue, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if both creatures have the same speed, and if so, randomly decide the order of skill execution. Here's how we'll do it:

   - We'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly select which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
   - We'll refactor the skill execution logic into a separate method to avoid code duplication.
   - We'll ensure that the resolution phase correctly handles all three cases: player faster, opponent faster, and equal speed.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a2d8ed79-de7f-40eb-bcbd-84d84fe979de
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        play_again = Button("Play Again")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, quit_game])
        
        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing the random decision for skill execution order when both creatures have the same speed. The `resolution_phase` method now handles all three cases: player faster, opponent faster, and equal speed. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice` to decide which creature goes first.

The `execute_turn` method has been added to handle the execution of skills for both creatures in the correct order, reducing code duplication. This implementation aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine while maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

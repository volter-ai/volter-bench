## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the missing `active_creature` field in the Player model. The error occurs because the `Player` class expects an `active_creature` attribute, but it's not being set when creating a player from the prototype data.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]`. This allows the field to be `None` when the player is first created.

2. We'll update the `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7adefda9-754a-40e5-bb98-9b9f4660c82c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional, allowing it to be `None` when the player is first created. The `MainGameScene` will then set the `active_creature` at the start of the battle.

Now, we need to update the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle. Here's the updated `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene`:

# Excerpt ID: 44657564-0503-4f84-9523-aa8f2f989c71
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
# ... (rest of the file remains the same)

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    # ... (other methods remain the same)

    def _initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} sent out {self.player.active_creature.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{self.opponent.display_name} sent out {self.opponent.active_creature.display_name}!")

    # ... (rest of the file remains the same)
```

These changes should resolve the ValidationError we were seeing. The `Player` model now allows for the `active_creature` to be `None` initially, and the `MainGameScene` sets the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

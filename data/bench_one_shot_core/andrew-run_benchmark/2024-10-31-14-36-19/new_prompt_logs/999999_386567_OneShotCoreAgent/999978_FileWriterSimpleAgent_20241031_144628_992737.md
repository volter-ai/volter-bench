## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this reset functionality within the scene itself.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a `_reset_creatures_state` method to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the foe, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method at the end of the `run` method, just before exiting the scene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: db812ee1-347f-4de9-a8dc-abfc08ea7764
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn, {self.player.display_name}!")
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe turn
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"It's your turn, {self.foe.display_name}!")
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures' state before exiting the scene
        self._reset_creatures_state()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(current_player, skill_choices).thing

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.foe_creature, player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def _apply_damage(self, creature, damage):
        creature.hp = max(0, creature.hp - damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds the `_reset_creatures_state` method to the MainGameScene class. This method resets the HP of all creatures (both player's and foe's) to their maximum HP. The method is called at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset before transitioning out of the scene.

This solution adheres to the guidelines by keeping the models as pure data schemas and implementing the reset functionality within the scene itself. It also stays within the capabilities of the engine by using the existing methods like `_show_text` to inform the players about the reset.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The random run test for MainGameScene is not completing as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to ensure it always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll adjust the _end_battle method to use the _transition_to_scene method instead of directly calling it.
3. We'll add a check in the run method to break the main loop if the battle has ended.

These changes will ensure that the scene always exits properly and that the tests can complete successfully.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to break the loop when the battle has ended.
3. Updating the `_force_swap` method to set `battle_ended` to True when a player has no more creatures.
4. Ensuring that `_end_battle` uses `_transition_to_scene` to properly exit the scene.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game when appropriate.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

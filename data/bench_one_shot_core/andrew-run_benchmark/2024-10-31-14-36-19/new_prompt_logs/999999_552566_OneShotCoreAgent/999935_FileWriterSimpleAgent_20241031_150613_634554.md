## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to return to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the check_battle_end method returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d1eb87dd-f747-4feb-8c4b-b9f8afd3f399
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self.get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
        
        # Add a button to return to the main menu
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        
        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits when the battle ends. The main changes are:

1. The `run` method now breaks out of its loop when `check_battle_end()` returns True.
2. A new `end_battle()` method has been added to handle the end of the battle. This method shows the battle result and provides a button for the player to return to the main menu.
3. The `check_battle_end()` method now returns a boolean value indicating whether the battle has ended.
4. After the player chooses to return to the main menu, the scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by allowing the player to quit the game from the main menu. This should resolve the issues in both the `test_main_game_scene_random_run` and `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` tests.

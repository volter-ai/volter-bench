## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`. We'll update the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `run` method in MainGameScene to continue the game loop until the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle, so the game can be played multiple times.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7e08150c-0b3a-4094-b8ea-9feb08f26524
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage.")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The `run` method now continues the battle loop until `battle_ended` is True.
2. After the battle ends, we reset the creatures' HP and transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We've added a `reset_creatures` method to restore the HP of both creatures after each battle.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The random test runs should now complete successfully without getting stuck in the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We can't add methods to the models, so we'll need to handle this in the MainGameScene.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning to another scene.
3. We'll call this method when the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 7d837ed5-a5ae-42c6-90b0-719ffaf3fd90
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            if player_skill is None:
                return

            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                return

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == quit_button:
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return None

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

In this updated version of the MainGameScene, we've added a new method `_reset_creatures()` that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. This method is called in three places:

1. In the `_player_turn()` method, before quitting the game.
2. In the `_check_battle_end()` method, before transitioning to the MainMenuScene when the player loses.
3. In the `_check_battle_end()` method, before transitioning to the MainMenuScene when the player wins.

This ensures that the creatures' state is reset whenever the player leaves the MainGameScene, addressing the issue raised in the QA pass. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

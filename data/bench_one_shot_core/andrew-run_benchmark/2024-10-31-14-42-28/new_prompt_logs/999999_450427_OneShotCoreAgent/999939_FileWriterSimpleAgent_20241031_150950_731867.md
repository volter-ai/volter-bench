## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit when the battle ends. Here's how we'll do it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll call this method in the check_battle_end method when either player's creature faints.
3. We'll ensure the battle_loop continues until the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f2817df0-13f5-4495-8a4f-d38150bf9383
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits when the battle ends by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This should resolve both issues:

1. The MainGameScene will now exit properly when the battle ends, either by transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game.
2. The whole game flow should now complete correctly, as the MainGameScene will properly transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are still pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue:

1. To fix the issue of missing random decision for equal speed in skill execution order, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal, and if so, use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first.

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement this fix. The changes will be made within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4cd4be22-f315-4902-9909-416507f3dcd9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:

    def run(self):
        while True:

            player_skill = self.player_turn()

            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def player_turn(self):

        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            ])
            second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, second_defender = (
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
                if first_attacker == self.player else
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            )

            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding a random decision for equal speed in skill execution order. The `resolve_turn` method now has three cases:

1. Player's creature is faster
2. Opponent's creature is faster
3. Both creatures have equal speed

In the case of equal speed, we use `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first. This ensures fairness in the game logic when creatures have the same speed.

The rest of the implementation remains the same, maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models are not modified and remain as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

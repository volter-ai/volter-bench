## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The current implementation doesn't handle the case where creatures have the same speed, which should result in a random order of skill execution. To fix this, we'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills in the determined order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b3017cd7-76e4-47b1-9f7e-4415d5850a2e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill = self.player, player_skill
            second_attacker, second_skill = self.opponent, opponent_skill
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill = self.opponent, opponent_skill
            second_attacker, second_skill = self.player, player_skill
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first_attacker, first_skill = self.player, player_skill
                second_attacker, second_skill = self.opponent, opponent_skill
            else:
                first_attacker, first_skill = self.opponent, opponent_skill
                second_attacker, second_skill = self.player, player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first_attacker, first_attacker.creatures[0], first_skill, second_attacker.creatures[0])
        if second_attacker.creatures[0].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second_attacker, second_attacker.creatures[0], second_skill, first_attacker.creatures[0])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self, message):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining which creature goes first in that scenario. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, and we've maintained the separation of concerns by keeping all game logic within the scene and not modifying any models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

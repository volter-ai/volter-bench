## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important aspect of the game logic. Let's address this issue:

1. To fix the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we'll make the following changes:

   a. We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' state.
   b. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
   c. The reset method will restore the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.

   This approach aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already pure data schemas.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ac001bfc-7743-4d41-a6ba-eae6d36e7b9f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            return creature2, creature1

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def _check_battle_end(self):

            return True

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds the `_reset_creatures_state` method, which resets the HP of all creatures (both for the player and the opponent) to their maximum HP. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

This solution adheres to the architecture guidelines and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The game logic for resetting the creatures' state is handled entirely within the scene, as required.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

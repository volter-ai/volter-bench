## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in MainGameScene continues until a transition or quit occurs.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: a3029342-c051-4418-b176-1f6ab7403865
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.bot_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, bot_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, skill: Skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop continues until the battle ends.
2. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
3. Resetting the creatures' HP after each battle.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The game flow now correctly handles the end of battles and returns to the main menu, allowing for multiple playthroughs without getting stuck in the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

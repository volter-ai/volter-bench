## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll describe how to fix these issues and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Adding 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:
   We'll modify the `get_player_action` method to include a 'Back' option when choosing between 'Attack' and 'Swap'. We'll also add a 'Back' option when choosing a skill or a creature to swap.

b) Implementing skill execution order based on creature speed:
   We'll modify the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to queue actions instead of executing them immediately. Then, we'll create a new method `resolve_turn` that sorts the actions based on creature speed and executes them in the correct order.

c) Implementing forced swapping when a creature is knocked out:
   We'll add a method `force_swap` that is called after each attack if the defending creature's HP reaches zero. This method will prompt the player to choose a new creature or automatically select one for the bot.

d) Resetting the state of creatures when leaving the scene:
   We'll add a `reset_creatures` method that is called when transitioning to another scene. This method will restore all creatures to their original state.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

        self.player.active_creature = None
        self.opponent.active_creature = None
```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA/testing feedback. It includes the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase, implements skill execution order based on creature speed with random tie-breaking, implements forced swapping when a creature is knocked out, and resets the state of creatures when leaving the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the issue of not handling equal speed correctly in the MainGameScene, we need to modify the `resolve_turn` method. We'll add a check for equal speed and use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly decide which creature goes first in that case. This change will ensure that when creatures have the same speed, the order of skill execution is randomized, as specified in the architecture documentation.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

I'll update the `main_game_scene.py` file to include this fix. The changes will be made in the `resolve_turn` method.

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated version of `main_game_scene.py` now correctly handles the case of equal speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first, as described in the architecture documentation. The `resolve_turn` method has been modified to use `random.sample` when the speeds are equal, ensuring a fair and random selection of which creature acts first in that scenario.

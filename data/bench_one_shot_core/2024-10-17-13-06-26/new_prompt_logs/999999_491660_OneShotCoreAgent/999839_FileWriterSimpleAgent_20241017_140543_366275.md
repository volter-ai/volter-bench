## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing implementation for random turn order when creatures have the same speed, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. Specifically, we'll update the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random factor when sorting the turn queue for creatures with equal speed.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll modify the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random factor for creatures with the same speed.
2. We'll use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random float between 0 and 1, which will be used as a tiebreaker for equal speeds.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, maintaining their pure data schema nature.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

    def _end_battle(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main change is in the `_resolution_phase` method, where we've updated the sorting key to include a random factor:

# Excerpt ID: 3506c054-9f04-4ed6-a225-dbadc2edc322
```python
self.turn_queue.sort(key=lambda x: (
    x[1] != "swap",  # Swap actions go first
    -x[0].active_creature.speed,  # Higher speed goes first
    random.random()  # Random tiebreaker for equal speeds
))
```

This modification ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, their order in the turn queue will be randomized. This implements the random turn order for creatures with the same speed, as required by the architecture documentation.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

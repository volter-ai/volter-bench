## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Modify the damage calculation method to truncate the final damage to an integer instead of rounding it.
2. Explicitly handle equal speed scenarios by using the order in which actions were added to the queue as a tie-breaker, rather than using a random tie-breaker.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `calculate_damage` method, I'll use `int()` instead of `round()` to truncate the final damage to an integer.
2. In the `resolve_actions` method, I'll modify the sorting key to use the index of the action in the original list as a tie-breaker for equal speeds.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. In the `calculate_damage` method, I've changed `int(round(final_damage))` to `int(final_damage)`. This ensures that the final damage is truncated to an integer instead of being rounded.

2. In the `resolve_actions` method, I've modified the sorting key to use the original index of the action in the list as a tie-breaker for equal speeds. This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, the order of their actions is determined by the order in which they were added to the queue, rather than using a random tie-breaker.

These modifications should resolve the issues identified in the QA report while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game. The implementation now correctly truncates damage calculations and handles equal speed scenarios as specified in the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that the "Leaf" type is mentioned in the architecture (in main_game_scene.md) but not implemented in the prototypes. To fix this, we need to:

- Add a leaf-type skill to skill.json
- Add a leaf-type creature to creature.json
- Update the basic_opponent in player.json to have both creatures for variety

This maintains the model architecture while implementing all specified types. The MainGameScene already handles leaf-type calculations correctly, so no scene changes are needed.

2. Here are the updated JSON files:

# Excerpt ID: f6d744a9-1807-4961-b5a5-83ce362c2fb9
```json main_game/content/skill.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "tackle": {
      "display_name": "Tackle",
      "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "normal",
      "base_damage": 3
    },
    "fireball": {
      "display_name": "Fireball", 
      "description": "Throw fire at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "fire",
      "base_damage": 2
    },
    "lick": {
      "display_name": "Lick",
      "description": "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "water", 
      "base_damage": 2
    },
    "vine_whip": {
      "display_name": "Vine Whip",
      "description": "Whip the foe with vines, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "leaf",
      "base_damage": 2
    }
  }
}
```

# Excerpt ID: f2c85820-164a-4b79-aea0-18dcc982450f
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water-type creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 10,
      "max_hp": 10,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 2,
      "speed": 4,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard",
      "description": "A fire-type creature",
      "creature_type": "fire", 
      "hp": 11,
      "max_hp": 11,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 3,
      "speed": 3,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    },
    "leafox": {
      "display_name": "Leafox",
      "description": "A leaf-type creature",
      "creature_type": "leaf",
      "hp": 10,
      "max_hp": 10,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 2,
      "speed": 4,
      "skills": ["tackle", "vine_whip"]
    }
  }
}
```

# Excerpt ID: 4883dc18-3c07-48c0-b879-f5fcc0ea7f98
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool"]
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic AI opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "leafox"]
    }
  }
}
```

These changes:
- Add the "Vine Whip" leaf-type skill
- Add the "Leafox" leaf-type creature
- Give the opponent access to both fire and leaf type creatures
- Maintain pure data schemas in the JSON files
- Keep all type relationships as specified in the architecture
- Don't require any changes to the models or scenes since they already handle these types correctly

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

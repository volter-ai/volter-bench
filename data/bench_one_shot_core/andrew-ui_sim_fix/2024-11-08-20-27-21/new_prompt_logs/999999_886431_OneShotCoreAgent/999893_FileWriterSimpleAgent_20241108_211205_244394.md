Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because it's not properly handling the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception that occurs when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene (which then quits the game).

According to the test output, the game is working correctly - we can see the battle playing out, creatures fainting, and proper transitions. The issue is just that we need to catch the expected quit exception in the test.

Let me fix the test file:

# Excerpt ID: e2d692e6-cd62-42c2-853b-174630d7779b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully after battle. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game quits gracefully
4. Added catch-all handler that re-raises unexpected exceptions

This fix:
- Maintains the engine's architecture
- Properly handles the expected quit behavior
- Still catches RandomModeGracefulExit for when random moves run out
- Preserves the ability to catch real errors
- Keeps the test's purpose of validating the battle scene works

The test will now pass because it properly handles both ways the scene can end:
1. When random moves run out (RandomModeGracefulExit)
2. When the battle ends and transitions to main menu which quits (_QuitWholeGame)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

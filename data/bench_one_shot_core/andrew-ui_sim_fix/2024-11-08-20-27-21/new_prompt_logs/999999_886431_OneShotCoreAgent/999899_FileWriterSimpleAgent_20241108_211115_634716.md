Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but getting an empty list. This happens when all creatures are either fainted or already active. We need to handle this case properly.

The error occurs in get_player_action() when trying to swap creatures. We filter out both fainted creatures AND the active creature, which could result in no choices. Instead, we should:

1. Only filter out fainted creatures when showing swap choices
2. Add a "Back" button to return to the main action menu
3. Handle the case where no swaps are available by showing a message and returning to the main menu

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
2. Only filter out fainted creatures when showing swap choices
3. Added check for when no swaps are available
4. Made the action selection loop until a valid choice is made
5. Added null checks in the run() method for when no valid actions are available

This should fix the empty choices error while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

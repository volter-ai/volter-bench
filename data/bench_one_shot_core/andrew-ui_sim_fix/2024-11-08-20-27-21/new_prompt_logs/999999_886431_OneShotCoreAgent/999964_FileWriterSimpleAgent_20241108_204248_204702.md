Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs during random testing.

The problem is:
1. During random testing, scenes transition between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene
2. Eventually MainMenuScene chooses "Quit" and raises _QuitWholeGame
3. This exception needs to be caught in the test, similar to how we catch TransitionFromScene

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 73eea14c-7302-4785-95ea-3682f0d23a40
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "Scene did not transition or quit properly"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the exceptions we catch
2. Added a print statement to show when the game quits gracefully
3. Simplified the assertion since we only care about transitions in this test
4. Removed unnecessary mock of quit_whole_game since we want that to propagate up

This maintains the proper testing pattern while handling all possible ways the scene can end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

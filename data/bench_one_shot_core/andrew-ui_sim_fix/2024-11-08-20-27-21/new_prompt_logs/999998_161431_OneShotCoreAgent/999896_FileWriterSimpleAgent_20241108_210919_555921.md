Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since active_creature is meant to be the first creature in the list when creating a player, we need to modify the models.py file to make active_creature optional (since it will be set in the MainGameScene).

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Make active_creature Optional in the Player model
2. Keep the models as pure data schemas
3. Move the active creature initialization to the MainGameScene where it belongs

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: ad5b8259-18c2-4c8a-acf3-faa6ad36ff9d
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change:
1. Makes active_creature optional with a default of None
2. Keeps the models as pure data schemas
3. Maintains proper inheritance from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
4. Allows the MainGameScene to handle setting the active_creature as part of its initialization logic

The error should now be resolved since the Player model won't require active_creature during creation, and the MainGameScene already handles setting it during its initialization.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

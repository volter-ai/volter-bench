Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is running in random mode and transitioning between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene repeatedly until it hits quit, but we're not catching this expected exception.

The fix is to:
1. Update test_main_game_scene.py to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Also catch TransitionFromScene since we want to handle both ways a scene can end
3. Add proper mocking of transitions like in test_main_menu_scene.py
4. Add proper assertions to verify the scene behaved correctly

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 86faffdb-124d-41cb-9dc2-d583d59daeee
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                    assert mock_transition.called
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                    assert mock_quit.called
                else:
                    # Scene must exit via transition or quit
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called

                mock_transition.reset_mock()
                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper mocking of _transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game
2. Added catching of AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added catching of TransitionFromScene
4. Added assertions to verify the scene exited properly
5. Added proper cleanup of mocks between iterations

This maintains the architecture while properly testing that the scene behaves correctly within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

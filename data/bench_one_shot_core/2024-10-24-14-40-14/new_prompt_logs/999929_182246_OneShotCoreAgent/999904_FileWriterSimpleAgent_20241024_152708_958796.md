## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the tests to fail because the scene is not exiting in the expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle.

3. We'll ensure that the scene loop continues until an explicit transition or quit action is taken.

Here's the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The `run` method now has an outer loop that allows for multiple battles.
2. After each battle, it asks the player if they want to play again or quit.
3. If the player chooses to quit, it calls `self._quit_whole_game()`, ensuring proper termination.
4. If the player chooses to play again, it resets the creatures and starts a new battle.
5. The `reset_creatures` method now properly resets both the player's and opponent's creature HP.

These changes should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the main menu or by quitting the whole game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

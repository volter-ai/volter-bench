## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in MainGameScene continues until the battle is over.
3. We'll add a check to make sure the battle ends when all creatures of either player are knocked out.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the battle until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Checking for battle end conditions after each action in the `_resolve_turn` method.
4. Ensuring that `_transition_to_scene` is called at the end of the battle in the `_end_battle` method.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game when appropriate. The game loop will now continue until the battle is decisively ended, and the scene will transition correctly when the battle is over.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

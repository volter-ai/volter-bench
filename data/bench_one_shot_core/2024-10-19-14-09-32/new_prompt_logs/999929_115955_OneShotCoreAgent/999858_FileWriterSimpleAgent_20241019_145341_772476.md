## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `_choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to swap creatures when there are no available creatures to swap to. This can happen when all creatures except the active one are knocked out (have 0 HP). Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Modify the `_choose_swap` method to handle the case when there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. Update the `_player_choice_phase` method to skip the swap option if there are no available creatures to swap to.
3. Ensure that the battle ends when a player has no more creatures available to fight.

Here's the proposed solution, rewriting the `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 8e5b0587-1612-4927-a0e7-68748c988d2b

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `_has_creatures_to_swap` method to check if a player has any creatures available to swap.
2. Modifying the `_player_choice_phase` to only show the "Swap" option if there are creatures available to swap.
3. Updating the `_choose_swap` method to handle the case when there are no creatures available to swap, falling back to the attack option.
4. Adding a `_force_swap` method to handle creature fainting, which sets the `active_creature` to `None` if no creatures are available.
5. Updating the `_perform_attack` method to call `_force_swap` when a creature faints.

These changes ensure that the game handles situations where a player has no more creatures to swap, preventing the `_wait_for_choice` method from being called with an empty list of choices. The battle will end when a player has no more creatures available to fight.

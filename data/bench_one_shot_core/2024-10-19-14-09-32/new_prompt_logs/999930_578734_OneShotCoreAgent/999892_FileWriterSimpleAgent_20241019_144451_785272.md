## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address both the random order for equal speed in the resolution phase and the missing call to reset creatures after the battle ends. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method of `MainGameScene`, I'll implement a random order when the speeds are equal.
2. I'll call the `_reset_creatures` method at the end of the `_check_battle_end` method, just before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will align the implementation with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: c1b48add-375e-458e-8d11-00ddbdd88a71
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        while True:

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):

        else:
            # Equal speed, random order
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The random order for equal speed is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method. When the speeds are equal, there's a 50% chance for either creature to go first.
2. The `_reset_creatures` method is now called at the end of the `_check_battle_end` method, just before transitioning to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that the creatures' HP are reset after each battle, preparing them for potential future battles.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies and align the implementation with the described architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the two main problems: the speed tie-breaker and the handling of the 'Normal' type. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Speed tie-breaker:
   - In the `resolve_turn` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll add a check for equal speed.
   - If speeds are equal, we'll use `random.choice` to decide which creature goes first.

2. 'Normal' type handling:
   - We'll modify the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to explicitly return 1 for 'Normal' type skills.
   - This ensures that 'Normal' type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: e5760d8a-49da-4a49-8d2c-f16777555c3e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))

            player_skill = self.player_turn()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
        
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button])
        
        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            return skill_choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            else:
                first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

        self.execute_skill(*first, second[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type.lower() == "normal":
            return 1  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        
        weakness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return weakness_chart.get(skill_type.lower(), {}).get(creature_type.lower(), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `resolve_turn` method now handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first.
2. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'Normal' type, ensuring it's neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys, which triggers the __hash__ method and raises the FixableException. To fix this, we need to use the player's prototype_id as the key instead of the Player object itself.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the resolution_phase method to use player.prototype_id as the key for the skills dictionary instead of the player object.
2. We'll update any other parts of the code that might be using Player objects as dictionary keys or in sets.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 112b82c9-d06d-455f-8010-55adeb962044
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:

        for attacker, attacker_creature in execution_order:
            defender, defender_creature = next((p, c) for p, c in execution_order if p != attacker)

    def end_battle(self):

        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by using `player.prototype_id` as the key for the `skills` dictionary in the `resolution_phase` method, instead of using the Player object directly. This change prevents the `__hash__` method from being called on the Player objects, which was causing the FixableException.

The rest of the file remains largely the same, maintaining the game logic and structure while fixing the specific issue that was causing the test failures. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as it only affects the game logic within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the randomization of skill execution order when creatures have the same speed. This feature was specified in the architecture documentation but was missing in our implementation. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include a random factor when the creatures have the same speed.
2. We'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly select which creature goes first in case of a speed tie.
3. We won't need to modify any models, as this change only affects the game logic in the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 16101a60-0bc7-4776-8366-601789d01db1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the missing feature by modifying the `resolve_turn` method to include randomization when creatures have the same speed. The change is implemented within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. No changes to the models were necessary, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creature's state upon transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp when the battle ends.
2. We'll do this in the `check_battle_end` method, right before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll use the `from_prototype_id` method to recreate the creatures with their initial state.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c1dd13fb-06eb-4644-9f9a-901a05dd9c1e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices).thing

    def foe_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices).thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        # Reset player's creature
        new_player_creature = create_from_game_database(self.player_creature.prototype_id, Creature)
        self.player.creatures[0] = new_player_creature
        self.player_creature = new_player_creature

        # Reset opponent's creature
        new_opponent_creature = create_from_game_database(self.opponent_creature.prototype_id, Creature)
        self.opponent.creatures[0] = new_opponent_creature
        self.opponent_creature = new_opponent_creature
```

This solution adds a new `reset_creatures` method that recreates the creatures using their prototype IDs, effectively resetting their state to the initial values. This method is called in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene.

This approach maintains the separation of concerns, keeps the models as pure data schemas, and uses the engine's capabilities to reset the game state as required by the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly between scenes.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow.

2. We'll also add a check to see if the player wants to play again or quit the game after each battle. This will give the player control over continuing or ending the game.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 640be9d7-9b0d-4cfc-8d01-1a9fd9772d95
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `_post_battle_menu()` method that is called after each battle ends.
2. In the `_post_battle_menu()`, we give the player a choice to play again or quit.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition to a new MainGameScene (to play again) or back to the MainMenuScene.
4. We've removed the direct return from the `run()` method, ensuring that the scene always exits through a proper transition.

These changes should resolve both the issue of the MainGameScene not exiting properly and the whole game flow not transitioning correctly between scenes. The game will now have a clear path to either continue playing or return to the main menu after each battle, following the expected flow and adhering to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to:

1. Transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Properly handle the end of the battle by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

Here's how we'll fix the `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 710a3e29-735e-46f1-ae0a-d3b26a77afaf
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
        
        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} and deals {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        choices = [Button("Return to Main Menu"), Button("Quit Game")]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        
        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that is called after the battle ends.
2. In the `end_battle` method, we give the player a choice to return to the main menu or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
4. This ensures that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene behaves correctly within the game's architecture and the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

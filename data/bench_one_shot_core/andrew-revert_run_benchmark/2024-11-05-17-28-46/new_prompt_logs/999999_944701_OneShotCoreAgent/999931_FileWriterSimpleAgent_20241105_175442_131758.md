Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the damage calculation in the `MainGameScene` to perform calculations with floats before converting to integers, as specified in the architecture. This change will be implemented in the `execute_skill` method of the `MainGameScene` class.

Here's how I will fix the issue:

1. In the `execute_skill` method, I will change the damage calculation to use floats.
2. The final conversion to an integer will be done only at the end of the calculation.
3. I will use the `math.floor` function to ensure we're rounding down when converting to an integer, as this is typically how damage is calculated in games.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7c21a9be-5202-4907-88a0-54b26d67b984
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random
import math

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose a skill to use:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices).thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        factor = self.get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = math.floor(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by performing damage calculations with floats before converting to integers, as specified in the architecture. The `execute_skill` method now uses float values for the initial calculations and only converts to an integer at the final step using `math.floor`. This ensures that the damage calculation aligns with the specified requirements while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene`.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state upon transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. The solution will involve adding a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 9bb1c673-1dfd-42b4-b83f-639aa22edd06
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if quit_button == choice:
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._quit_whole_game()

            if use_skill_button == choice:
                skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
                skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
                self.apply_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            # Opponent turn
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_creature.skills[0]  # Simple AI: always use the first skill
            self.apply_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def apply_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation adds the `reset_creatures` method to the MainGameScene class. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene (in the `check_battle_end` method) and before quitting the game. It resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value, ensuring that the creatures' state is properly reset when leaving the battle scene.

This solution adheres to the engine's capabilities and maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas while handling game logic within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state upon exiting the MainGameScene, I will make the following changes:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this reset logic directly in the scene.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 8fa014d7-69a7-4243-bf58-bf6ef4c6cb85
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._player_turn()
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._bot_turn()

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == use_skill_button:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self._use_skill(self.player_creature, self.bot_creature, skill_choice.thing)
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def _bot_turn(self):
        bot_skill = self.bot_creature.skills[0]  # Always use the first skill for simplicity
        self._use_skill(self.bot_creature, self.player_creature, bot_skill)

    def _use_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds a new `_reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot to their maximum values. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene and also when the player chooses to quit the game.

The changes ensure that the creatures' state is reset upon exiting the MainGameScene, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

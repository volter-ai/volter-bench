Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.
2. We'll add a loop in the run method of MainGameScene to allow for multiple battles.
3. We'll ensure that the game can be quit from the MainGameScene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a main loop in the `run` method that allows for multiple battles and provides options to play again or quit after each battle.
2. Including a "Quit Game" option in the player's choices during battle.
3. Properly transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game based on the player's choice.
4. Resetting creature HP for new battles when the player chooses to play again.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The game loop now continues after a battle ends, giving the player the option to play again or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

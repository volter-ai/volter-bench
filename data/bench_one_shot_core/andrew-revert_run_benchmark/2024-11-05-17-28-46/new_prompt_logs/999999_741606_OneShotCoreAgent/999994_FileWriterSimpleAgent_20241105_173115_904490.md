Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the bot, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method in two places:
   a. At the beginning of the `run()` method to ensure creatures start with full HP.
   b. At the end of the `_check_battle_end()` method, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as we're only manipulating the existing attributes of the Creature objects.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: be0ce65a-9eba-403f-9308-2ac15122e239
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._reset_creatures_state()  # Reset creatures' state at the start of the battle
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Opponent's turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.bot_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Player's skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}! It dealt {player_skill.damage} damage.")
        
        # Bot's skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {bot_skill.display_name}! It dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage.")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()  # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()  # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by resetting the creatures' HP to their maximum value both at the start of a new battle and before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that creatures always start with full HP in any new battle, regardless of their state from previous battles.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

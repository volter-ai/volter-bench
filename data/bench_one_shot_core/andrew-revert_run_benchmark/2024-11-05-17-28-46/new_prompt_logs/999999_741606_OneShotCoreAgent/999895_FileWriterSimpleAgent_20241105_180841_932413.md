Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the battle_loop method to call this transition method when the battle is over.
3. We'll ensure that the scene doesn't terminate without proper transition or quitting.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f918bae1-7a83-4d35-b4f4-3daa7e1c949a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed or (creature1.speed == creature2.speed and random.choice([True, False])):
            return (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1)
        else:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender, defender_creature):

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")

        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle loop continues until a battle end condition is met.
2. When the battle ends, it calls the `end_battle` method.
3. The `end_battle` method resets the creatures, shows a message, and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.

This implementation should resolve both issues:
1. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The test for MainGameScene should now pass because the scene will exit in an expected manner (by transitioning to MainMenuScene).

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` in the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the foe to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method at the end of the battle, right before transitioning out of the scene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3cbff871-1e0e-45d0-b347-49bc920e20ea
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn, {self.player.display_name}!")
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe turn
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"It's your turn, {self.foe.display_name}!")
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures_state()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(current_player, skill_choices).thing

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.foe_creature, player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def _apply_damage(self, creature, damage):
        creature.hp = max(0, creature.hp - damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures' HP has been restored.")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "All creatures' HP has been restored.")

```

This solution adds the `_reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the foe. The method is called at the end of the battle (in `_check_battle_end()`) and when the player chooses to quit during the battle. This ensures that the creatures' state is reset when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, as specified in the architecture documents.

The changes made are consistent with the engine's capabilities and the existing model structure. We didn't need to modify the `models.py` file because the Creature class already has the necessary attributes (hp and max_hp) to support this functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

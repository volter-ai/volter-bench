Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the reset of the player's creatures' state after a battle, as specified in the architecture. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' state.
2. This method will be called at the end of the battle, before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The reset will restore the creatures' HP to their max_hp value.

Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this logic in the MainGameScene. Here's the updated MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: aa166c5b-d7b8-41c6-92f6-37eafe376a9b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        self.reset_creatures_state()
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
        continue_button = Button("Continue")
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [continue_button])
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures_state` method that restores all creatures' HP to their max_hp value.
2. Calling this method in the `end_battle` method, before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Showing a message to the player that all creatures have been restored to full health.

These changes ensure that the player's creatures' state is reset after each battle, as required by the architecture. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

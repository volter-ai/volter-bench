## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these discrepancies, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Implement explicit management of action execution order based on speed.
3. Add a method to reset creature state upon leaving the scene.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. Modify the `get_player_action` method to include a 'Back' option when choosing a skill or creature to swap.
2. Create a new method `execute_turn` that will handle the order of action execution based on creature speed.
3. Add a `reset_creatures` method to reset creature states, and call it in the `run` method before exiting the scene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 39cca27c-982d-4228-940f-5c81daacc87e

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now included in both the attack and swap action selection.
2. The `execute_turn` method now explicitly manages the order of action execution based on creature speed.
3. The `reset_creatures` method is added to reset creature states, and it's called before exiting the scene.

These modifications should bring the implementation in line with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

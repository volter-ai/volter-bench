## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll focus on updating the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Implement the logic for executing skills based on speed and resolving ties randomly.
3. Add the reset state of player's creatures when leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. No changes to the models are required as these are gameplay logic issues.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. The 'Back' option is now available in both the attack and swap choice phases.
2. The `resolve_actions` method now implements the logic for executing skills based on speed and resolving ties randomly.
3. The `reset_creatures_state` method is called at the end of the battle to reset the state of all creatures.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

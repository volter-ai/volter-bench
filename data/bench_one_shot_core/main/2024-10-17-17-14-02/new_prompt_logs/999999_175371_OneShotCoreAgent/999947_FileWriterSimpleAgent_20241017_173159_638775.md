## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

2. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to return True when the battle is over, and use this to break out of the main game loop.

3. We'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 0142169a-06c3-4552-9149-aa655f780773
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def _format_skills(self, skills):

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
        
        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self._get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "fire":

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. The main game loop now breaks when `_check_battle_end()` returns True.
2. After the battle ends, the scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly after the battle ends, either by winning or losing. The transition back to the MainMenuScene provides a natural flow for the game, allowing the player to start a new battle or quit the game.

The test should now pass because the scene will properly exit by transitioning to another scene, which will trigger the mocked `_transition_to_scene` method in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this functionality within the scene itself.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max HP.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: eedc25c7-8146-4b17-bd8a-f23a4e9d96cd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, target):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.creatures[0].attack + skill.base_damage - target.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.creatures[0].sp_attack / target.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        effectiveness = self.calculate_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, target.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * effectiveness)
        
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def calculate_effectiveness(self, skill_type, target_type):
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "normal": {"fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(target_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

In this updated version of `main_game_scene.py`, we've added the `reset_creatures` method at the end of the class. This method iterates through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max HP.

We call this `reset_creatures` method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `run` method:

# Excerpt ID: 346c314d-b11c-4c6d-a3ff-33a1c0d6c5d8
```python
    def run(self):
        # ... (previous code remains the same)

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This ensures that all creatures are restored to full health before the player returns to the main menu, addressing the issue raised in the QA pass. The functionality is implemented within the scene, keeping the models as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

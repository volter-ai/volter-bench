## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `get_swap_action` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures except the active one have fainted, leaving no available creatures to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `get_swap_action` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. We'll update the `get_player_action` method to handle the case where `get_swap_action` returns `None`.
4. We'll also update the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to handle the case where no action is available.

Here's the implementation of these changes:

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{player.display_name} was forced to swap to {new_creature.display_name}!")
```

These changes should resolve the issue while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `MainGameScene` now handles the case where no swap actions are available, and it also checks if any actions are available before executing a turn. This should prevent the `_wait_for_choice` method from being called with an empty list of choices.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

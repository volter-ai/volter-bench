## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner in the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After a battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of just breaking the loop.
2. We'll add a "Return to Main Menu" option after each turn, allowing the player to exit the battle at any time.

Here's how we'll implement these changes in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 316e78b2-cc09-48cc-a535-90ef3b79560c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_choice = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            if isinstance(player_choice, Button) and player_choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a "Return to Main Menu" option in the player's choices.
2. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends or when the player chooses to return to the main menu.
3. Ensuring that the scene always exits properly by calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly in all scenarios.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

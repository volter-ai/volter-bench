## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which is required by the engine to properly end a scene.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll add a choice for the player to either return to the main menu or quit the game.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll call either `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` or `_quit_whole_game()`.
3. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until one of these transitions occurs.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 069691e1-0342-47e4-9849-db271db6e5dd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` class addresses the issue by:

1. Adding an `_end_game_choice` method that presents the player with options to return to the main menu or quit the game after a battle ends.
2. Modifying the `run` method to call `_end_game_choice` when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always transitions or quits properly.
3. Returning from the `run` method after handling the end game choice, which prevents the scene from continuing to run after it should have ended.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, resolving the FixableException that was being raised.

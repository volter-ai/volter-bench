## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase for both attack and swap choices.
2. Implement random order handling for actions with the same speed.
3. Add a method to reset creature states when leaving the `MainGameScene`.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: fd981ec2-e6ee-46eb-9122-a87d097121dd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. Added a 'Back' option in both the `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main choice phase.
2. Implemented random order handling for actions with the same speed in the `_resolution_phase` method.
3. Added a `_reset_creature_states` method to reset the HP of all creatures and clear the active creatures when leaving the `MainGameScene`.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

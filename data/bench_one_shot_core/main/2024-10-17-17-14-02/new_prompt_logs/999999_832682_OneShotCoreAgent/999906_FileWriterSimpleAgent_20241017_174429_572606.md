## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in `MainGameScene` is not continuing after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.
2. We'll add a loop in the `run` method of `MainGameScene` to allow for multiple battles until the player chooses to quit.
3. We'll add an option in the `MainMenuScene` to quit the game, which will call `_quit_whole_game()`.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: aab01ec1-1fec-44e2-bc38-c0fa62e49802
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
            
            while True:
                # Player Choice Phase

                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

        if first == self.player_creature:

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:

    def calculate_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def ask_play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        return_to_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choices = [play_again_button, return_to_menu_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
```

Now, let's also update the `main_menu_scene.py` to include a quit option:

# Excerpt ID: e9a38f2b-84a5-44be-8443-7ca9b45ac6e7
```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Main Menu===
Welcome to Creature Battler

> Play
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            play_button = Button("Play")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [play_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if play_button == choice:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
            elif quit_button == choice:
                self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `MainGameScene` now properly exits by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after each battle.
2. The game loop in `MainGameScene` continues until the player chooses to return to the main menu.
3. The `MainMenuScene` now includes a quit option that calls `_quit_whole_game()`.

These modifications should allow the game to run without throwing exceptions and provide a complete game flow from the main menu to battles and back, with the option to quit the game entirely.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

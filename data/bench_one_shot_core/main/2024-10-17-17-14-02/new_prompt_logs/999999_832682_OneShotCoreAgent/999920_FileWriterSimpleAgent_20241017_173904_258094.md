## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the feedback. I understand that the implementation is missing the random choice for skill execution order when creatures have the same speed. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement the random choice for skill execution order when creatures have the same speed, we'll modify the `_resolve_turns` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal, and if so, use Python's `random.choice` function to determine which creature goes first. This aligns with the architecture requirements and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the fix implemented:

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding a random choice for skill execution order when creatures have the same speed. The `_resolve_turns` method now includes a condition to handle equal speeds, using `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first. This change aligns with the architecture requirements and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll add a choice for the player to either play again or quit the game.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll ensure that the battle loop continues until a transition or quit action is taken.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: c651e083-5a17-4e9e-aac3-64f5cd35b16e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        while True:
            self.battle_loop()
            if not self.play_again():
                break
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self.bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def bot_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} uses {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            return True
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
        return False
```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Wrapping the battle_loop in a while True loop that continues until the player chooses not to play again.
2. Adding a play_again method that gives the player the choice to play another battle or quit the game.
3. Properly transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the player decides not to play again.
4. Calling _quit_whole_game when the player chooses to quit.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game entirely. This should resolve both the test failures and the FixableException that was being raised.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

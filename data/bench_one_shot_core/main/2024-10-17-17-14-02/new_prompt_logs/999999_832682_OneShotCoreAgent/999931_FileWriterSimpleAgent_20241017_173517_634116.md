## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the damage calculation where we're not using floats before converting to an integer, as specified in the architecture documentation. To fix this, we need to modify the `_execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll change the damage calculation to use floats throughout the process.
2. We'll only convert the final damage to an integer at the very end of the calculation.

This change will be made in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 48ab0cb5-8eaa-409f-a440-595da8784503
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while True:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _is_battle_over(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _player_choice_phase(self):

    def _determine_order(self, player_choice, opponent_choice):

        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_choice), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_choice)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:

            else:
                return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_choice), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_choice)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill_choice: SelectThing):
        defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
        defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
        skill: Skill = skill_choice.thing

        # Use floats for all calculations
        raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender_creature.defense)
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)  # Convert to int only at the end

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
```

The main changes are in the `_execute_skill` method:

1. We now explicitly convert the `attack`, `base_damage`, and `defense` values to floats.
2. We perform all calculations using these float values.
3. We only convert the `final_damage` to an integer at the very end of the calculation.

Additionally, in the `_get_type_factor` method, we've changed all the return values to explicitly use float notation (e.g., `1.0` instead of `1`) to ensure consistency with float calculations.

These changes ensure that we're using floats throughout the damage calculation process, as specified in the architecture documentation, before converting to an integer for the final damage value. This should resolve the discrepancy noted in the QA pass.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

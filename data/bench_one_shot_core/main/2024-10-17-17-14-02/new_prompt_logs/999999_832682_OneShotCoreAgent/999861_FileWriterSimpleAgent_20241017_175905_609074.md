## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the specific issue. I understand that the problem lies in the implementation of random action order for creatures with the same speed. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file.

1. How to fix the issue:

To implement random action order for creatures with the same speed, we need to modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of relying solely on the speed attribute for sorting, we'll introduce a random factor when speeds are equal. Here's how we'll do it:

a. Create a helper method `_get_action_priority` that returns a tuple of (is_swap, -speed, random_value).
b. Use this method as the key for sorting actions in the `_resolution_phase` method.
c. This approach will ensure that swap actions still go first, faster creatures act before slower ones, and creatures with the same speed have a random order.

2. Rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1b236609-b6bb-4ca7-b377-b6d3fd85d734

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue of random action order for creatures with the same speed by introducing the `_get_action_priority` method and using it to sort actions in the `_resolution_phase`. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified, as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Implement random tie-breaking for actions with the same speed in the resolution phase.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the current architecture. Here's how I'll address each issue:

1. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, I'll add a 'Back' button and implement the logic to return to the main choice when 'Back' is selected.
2. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor for tie-breaking when speeds are equal.
3. I'll add a new method `_reset_creatures_state` that will be called when transitioning back to the main menu.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now provided in both the attack and swap choice phases.
2. Random tie-breaking for actions with the same speed is implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method.
3. The `_reset_creatures_state` method is added and called at the end of the battle to reset the state of all creatures.

The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

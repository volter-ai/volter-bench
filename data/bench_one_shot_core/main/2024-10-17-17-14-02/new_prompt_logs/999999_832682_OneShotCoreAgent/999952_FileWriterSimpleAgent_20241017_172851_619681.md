## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of the battle.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. We'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes, giving the player the option to play again or quit the game.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll modify the main game loop to call this new method when the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):

    def _player_turn(self):

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This should resolve both issues mentioned in the QA/testing report:

1. The scene now exits properly by calling `_transition_to_scene` at the end of the battle.
2. The game loop now breaks and calls the `_end_battle` method, which handles the transition, ensuring that the scene doesn't terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas, and it uses the proper methods provided by the AbstractGameScene class to handle scene transitions.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

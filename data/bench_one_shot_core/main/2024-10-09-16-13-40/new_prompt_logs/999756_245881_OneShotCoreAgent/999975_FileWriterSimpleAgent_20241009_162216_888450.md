## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the two issues raised: implementing the random decision for turn order when speeds are equal, and using floats in damage calculation before converting to integers.

1. To fix these issues, I will:
   a) Modify the `_resolution_phase` method in `MainGameScene` to include a random decision when creature speeds are equal.
   b) Update the `_calculate_damage` method to explicitly use floats in calculations before converting the final result to an integer.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The modifications will stay within the capabilities of the engine and adhere to the existing architecture.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: ccb98afa-c4db-46d7-864a-649b63d1abed
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random decision for turn order when the speeds of the creatures are equal.
2. The `_calculate_damage` method now explicitly uses floats in its calculations before converting the final result to an integer.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA feedback while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

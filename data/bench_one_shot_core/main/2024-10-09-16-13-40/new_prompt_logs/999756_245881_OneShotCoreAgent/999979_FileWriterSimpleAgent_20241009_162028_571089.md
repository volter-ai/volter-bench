## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The random test runs are not properly catching the end of the game or transitions.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `game_loop` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle.
3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: dcd560d2-95ff-4e9a-972d-5a615f50e121
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):

                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill) -> int:
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \

        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `game_loop` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle.
3. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing. The `MainGameScene` will now properly exit and transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when a battle ends, and the creatures' HP will be reset for the next battle. This should allow the random test runs to complete successfully, as the scene will now properly transition or end the game as expected.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not explicitly removing skills from a queue during the Resolution Phase, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Add a queue for skills in the `MainGameScene` class.
2. Modify the player and foe choice phases to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queue and remove them after execution.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models. Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 269f5fe5-5fe2-46b3-82f3-527d3d1b34cd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, choice.thing))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.foe, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            acting_player, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            if acting_player == self.player:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.foe_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Introducing a `skill_queue` using `collections.deque()` to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. Modifying the `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them.
3. Updating the `resolution_phase` method to process skills from the queue and remove them after execution using `popleft()`.

These changes ensure that skills are explicitly removed from the queue during the Resolution Phase, adhering to the described architecture while maintaining the existing model structure and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both discrepancies in the MainGameScene implementation.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Random decision-making for skill execution order:
   We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to use random.choice when the creature speeds are equal.

   b. Using floats for damage calculation:
   We'll update the _execute_skill method to use floats for the damage calculation and only convert to an integer at the final step.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class within the main_game_scene.py file. The modifications will align the implementation with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: f749f3f2-ab7e-48a2-b64d-83a2b3b23b03

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The _resolution_phase method now uses random.choice to determine which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. The _execute_skill method now uses floats for the damage calculation, only converting to an integer at the final step.

These modifications should align the implementation with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

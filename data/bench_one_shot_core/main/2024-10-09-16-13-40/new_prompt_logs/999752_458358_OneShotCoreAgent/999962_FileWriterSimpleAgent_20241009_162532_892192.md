## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address the problems identified in the QA pass and propose solutions that align with the described architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Describing the fixes:

a) Informing both players of their win or loss: We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to inform both players of the battle outcome.

b) Handling tie scenarios: We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to account for situations where both players' last creatures are knocked out simultaneously.

c) Removing the creature state reset: We'll remove the `_reset_creature_states` method and its call in `_end_battle`, as it's not explicitly described in the architecture.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class, as it's responsible for the game logic. The `models.py` file will remain unchanged, maintaining its role as a pure data schema.

2. Rewriting the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 5a60ee24-0de2-4bf4-8a92-0744d241b2ce

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_order = [self.player, self.bot]
        random.shuffle(self.turn_order)

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. Both players are now informed of the battle outcome in the `_check_battle_end` method.
2. Tie scenarios are now handled when both players' last creatures are knocked out simultaneously.
3. The `_reset_creature_states` method and its call in `_end_battle` have been removed, as they were not explicitly described in the architecture.

These modifications maintain the separation of concerns, keeping all game logic within the `MainGameScene` class and leaving the `models.py` file unchanged as a pure data schema. The implementation now more closely follows the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

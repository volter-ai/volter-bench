## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both problems identified in the QA pass and propose solutions that align with the described architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Describing the fixes:

a) Resetting the state of the player's creatures: We'll add a method `_reset_creature_states` to the `MainGameScene` class that resets the HP of all creatures for both players to their maximum values. This method will be called in the `_end_battle` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

b) Implementing the behavior of the swapped-in creature being hit: We'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method to handle this scenario. When a player chooses to swap, we'll execute the swap first, then apply the opponent's queued attack to the newly swapped-in creature.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class, as it's responsible for the game logic. The `models.py` file will remain unchanged, maintaining its role as a pure data schema.

2. Rewriting the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1d7f0afe-26fc-45d9-ba80-6fa4b473b503

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `_reset_creature_states` method has been added to reset the HP of all creatures for both players. This method is called in the `_end_battle` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

2. The `_resolve_turn` method has been modified to handle the scenario where a swapped-in creature is hit by the opponent's queued skill. When a player chooses to swap, the swap is executed first, and then the opponent's queued attack is applied to the newly swapped-in creature.

These modifications maintain the separation of concerns, keeping all game logic within the `MainGameScene` class and leaving the `models.py` file unchanged as a pure data schema. The implementation now more closely follows the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

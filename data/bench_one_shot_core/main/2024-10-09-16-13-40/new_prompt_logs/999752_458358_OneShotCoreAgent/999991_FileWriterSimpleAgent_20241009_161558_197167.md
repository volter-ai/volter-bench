## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Modify the resolution phase in the MainGameScene to handle equal speed creatures fairly.
2. Update the skill description in the JSON file to match the architecture document.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the resolution_phase method to randomly determine which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. We'll update the skill.json file to correct the description of the "Tackle" skill.

Let's rewrite the necessary files with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b7f9d8a0-f550-4c12-b228-f54cd9ea90ce
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly determine who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
                if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        # Add a button to return to the main menu
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        
        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

# Excerpt ID: 2c8e284d-d128-4016-ac17-7cff9785caea
```json main_game/content/skill.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "tackle": {
      "display_name": "Tackle",
      "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "base_damage": 3
    }
  }
}
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the resolution_phase method in MainGameScene to handle equal speed creatures fairly by randomly determining which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. Updating the skill description in the skill.json file to match the architecture document.

With these modifications, the MainGameScene should now properly handle cases where creatures have equal speed, and the skill description in the JSON file matches the architecture document. This should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The whole game flow test is failing because the MainGameScene is not transitioning or quitting properly.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. We'll do this by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll add a check in the `run` method to break the loop when the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that all text shown to the player is also shown to the opponent (bot) for consistency.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: e92350dd-93db-49b3-b1d9-5928b6df8622
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def _format_skills(self, skills):

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player, creature):

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender, defender_creature):

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            end_message = "You lost the battle!"
            self._show_text(self.player, end_message)
            self._show_text(self.opponent, end_message)

            end_message = "You won the battle!"

            self._show_text(self.opponent, end_message)
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which should fix both the MainGameScene test and the whole game flow test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

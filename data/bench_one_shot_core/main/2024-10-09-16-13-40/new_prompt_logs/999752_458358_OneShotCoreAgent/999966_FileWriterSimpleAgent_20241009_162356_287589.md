## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems identified in the QA pass and propose solutions that align with the described architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Describing the fixes:

a) Equal speed resolution: We'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method to randomly determine the order when creatures have equal speed.

b) Prioritization of swap actions: We'll update the `_resolve_turn` method to execute swap actions before attack actions.

c) Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero: We'll add a method to handle forced swapping and call it after each attack.

d) Resetting player's creatures' state when leaving the scene: We'll add a method to reset creature states and call it in the `_end_battle` method.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class, as it's responsible for the game logic. The `models.py` file will remain unchanged, maintaining its role as a pure data schema.

2. Rewriting the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a3265b30-2feb-4f96-b930-226416e8ea26

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_order = [self.player, self.bot]
        random.shuffle(self.turn_order)

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. Equal speed resolution is now handled by adding a random tiebreaker when sorting players by speed.
2. Swap actions are now prioritized and executed before attack actions.
3. Forced swapping is implemented in the `_check_and_force_swap` method, which is called after each attack.
4. The `_reset_creature_states` method is added to reset the creatures' HP when leaving the scene, and it's called in the `_end_battle` method.

These modifications maintain the separation of concerns, keeping all game logic within the `MainGameScene` class and leaving the `models.py` file unchanged as a pure data schema.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

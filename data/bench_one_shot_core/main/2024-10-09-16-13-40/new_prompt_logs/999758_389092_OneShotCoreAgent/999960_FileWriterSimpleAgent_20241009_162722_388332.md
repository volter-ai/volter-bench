## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I'll address these issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Remove the 'Lick' skill from the game, as it's not specified in the architecture.
2. Clarify the damage calculation process, ensuring that we're using integer arithmetic as specified in the architecture.
3. Simplify the bot's decision-making process to align with the architecture's specifications.

To implement these changes, we need to modify two files: `main_game/content/skill.json` and `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`. Here's how we'll update them:

1. In `skill.json`, we'll remove the 'Lick' skill and ensure only the specified skills (Tackle, Fireball) are present.
2. In `main_game_scene.py`, we'll update the damage calculation to use integer arithmetic throughout and clarify the process.
3. We'll simplify the bot's decision-making in the `foe_choice_phase` method.

Let's start with the `skill.json` file:

# Excerpt ID: b15b56ba-85d9-4e6a-b746-ddb23baa6154
```json main_game/content/skill.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "tackle": {
      "display_name": "Tackle",
      "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "normal",
      "is_physical": true,
      "base_damage": 7
    },
    "fireball": {
      "display_name": "Fireball",
      "description": "Throw fire at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "fire",
      "is_physical": false,
      "base_damage": 5
    }
  }
}
```

Now, let's update the `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 5577542a-5527-4acf-95b5-c12afe0c2da0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self.return_to_main_menu()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)

        if not self.check_battle_end():

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)
        else:

                return (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender, defender_creature):

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack * skill.base_damage) // defender_creature.sp_defense

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = (weakness_factor * raw_damage) // 1  # Integer division to ensure integer result

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):

        effectiveness = {

            "water": {"fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "leaf": {"fire": 1, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Resetting your creatures' state and returning to the main menu...")
        self.reset_creatures_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The 'Lick' skill has been removed from the `skill.json` file.
2. The damage calculation in `execute_skill` now uses integer arithmetic throughout, as specified in the architecture. We use integer division (`//`) to ensure integer results.
3. The bot's decision-making process in `foe_choice_phase` has been simplified to randomly choose a skill, which aligns with the architecture's lack of specific instructions for bot behavior.

These modifications maintain the separation of concerns, keep the models as pure data schemas, and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The changes are confined to the `MainGameScene` class and the `skill.json` file, and do not affect the models or other parts of the game architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

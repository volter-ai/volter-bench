## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' state.
2. We'll call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement the reset logic within the scene.

Here's how we'll implement this solution:

1. Add a new method called `reset_creatures_state()` in the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max HP.
3. Call this method in the `return_to_main_menu()` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: a49b493c-5b69-4228-ba1f-5162448f9b2d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)
        else:

        else:

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Resetting creatures' state and returning to the main menu...")
        self.reset_creatures_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures_state()` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value.
2. Calling this method in the `return_to_main_menu()` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These changes ensure that the state of the player's creatures (and the opponent's creatures) is reset when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, as required by the architecture documentation.

The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns:

- It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.
- It uses the appropriate methods provided by the AbstractGameScene class to handle scene transitions.
- The reset logic is implemented within the scene, not in the models.

This implementation should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing while adhering to the given architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Update the type relationships to correctly handle the 'Leaf' and 'Normal' types.
2. Show the opponent's creature's list of available skills during the Foe Choice Phase.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Update the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method to include the correct type relationships for 'Leaf' and 'Normal' types.
2. Modify the `_foe_choice_phase` method to show the opponent's creature's skills before making a choice.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 10f1c782-c151-4aae-88cf-f29b8e84b9a6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

        self._handle_battle_end()

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        # Show opponent's creature's skills
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name}'s available skills:")
        for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"- {skill.display_name}")
        
        # Opponent chooses a skill
        chosen_skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):

            return creature2, creature1

            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other type
        if skill_type == "normal" or defender_type == "normal":
            return 1
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_calculate_weakness_factor` method now correctly handles the 'Normal' type by returning a factor of 1 (neither effective nor ineffective) when either the skill type or defender type is 'Normal'.
2. The 'Leaf' type relationships are already correctly implemented in the `effectiveness` dictionary.
3. The `_foe_choice_phase` method now shows the opponent's creature's list of available skills before making a choice, improving transparency in the game flow.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and model structure while addressing the identified issues. The changes are within the capabilities of the engine and should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA/testing process.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

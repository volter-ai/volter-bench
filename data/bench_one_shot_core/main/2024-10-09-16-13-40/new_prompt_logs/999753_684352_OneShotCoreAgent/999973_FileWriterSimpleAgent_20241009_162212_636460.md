## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose a solution that adheres to the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Update the weakness-resistance factor calculation to handle the 'normal' type correctly.
2. Implement explicit float handling for special attack damage calculations.
3. Add random turn order for creatures with the same speed.
4. Clarify the reset of player's creatures state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.
5. Correct the damage calculation for physical attacks to match the specified formula.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.initial_player_creature_state = self.get_creature_state(self.player_creature)
        self.initial_opponent_creature_state = self.get_creature_state(self.opponent_creature)

    def __str__(self):

        for key, value in state.items():
            setattr(creature, key, value)
```

This solution addresses all the issues raised:

1. The `get_weakness_factor` method now correctly handles the 'normal' type, always returning 1.0 for it.
2. The damage calculation for both physical and special attacks now explicitly uses float values before converting to integers.
3. Random turn order for creatures with the same speed is implemented in the `resolution_phase` method.
4. The reset of player's creatures state is clarified with the `reset_creatures_state` method, which is called before transitioning out of the scene.
5. The damage calculation for physical attacks now matches the specified formula: `[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`

These changes adhere to the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method in MainGameScene to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. We'll update the game loop to break when the battle ends.
3. After the game loop, we'll add logic to transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game, depending on the battle outcome.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 8f89f065-ad5c-459d-ace2-a6412328dda4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()
        self.handle_battle_end()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.opponent_skill = next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order()
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0])
        if second[0].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0])

    def determine_turn_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again = Button("Play Again")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choices = [play_again, quit_game]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method that is called after the game loop ends.
2. In `handle_battle_end`, we give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the game. This should resolve the test failures and make the game flow more robust.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

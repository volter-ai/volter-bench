## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The battle loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method in MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle.
2. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 639987a8-cc76-4201-95fd-70794378f2cb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.opponent_skill = next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order()
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0])
        if second[0].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0])

    def determine_turn_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `battle_loop` method exits when the battle ends.
2. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
3. Making sure that `check_battle_end` returns a boolean value.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions to the next scene when the battle is over. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which was the root cause of the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem of the `chosen_action` attribute being unserializable. This attribute is causing warnings and potentially causing the test to fail. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll remove the `chosen_action` attribute from the Player model, as it's not part of the data schema and is being used as a temporary storage during the game logic.

2. Instead of storing the chosen action on the Player model, we'll modify the MainGameScene to handle the chosen actions within the scene logic.

3. We'll update the player_choice_phase method in MainGameScene to return the chosen action instead of storing it on the Player.

4. We'll adjust the resolution_phase method to accept the chosen actions as parameters.

Here's the proposed solution:

            return True
        return False
```

This solution removes the `chosen_action` attribute from the Player model and handles the action selection and resolution entirely within the MainGameScene. The `player_choice_phase` now returns the chosen action instead of storing it on the Player, and the `resolution_phase` takes these actions as parameters.

Additionally, we've added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls in the `check_battle_end` method to properly end the game when a winner is determined. This should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene.

These changes should resolve the unserializable attribute warnings and the scene termination issue while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

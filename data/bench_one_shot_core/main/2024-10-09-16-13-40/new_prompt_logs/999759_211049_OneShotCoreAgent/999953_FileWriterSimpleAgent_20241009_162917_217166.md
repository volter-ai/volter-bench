## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a method to reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Implement the behavior where the creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. Add a `reset_creatures_state` method that will be called at the end of the `run` method to reset all creatures' HP to their max HP.
2. Modify the `resolution_phase` method to handle the case where a creature is swapped in and immediately gets hit by the opponent's queued skill.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `reset_creatures_state` method is now called at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their max HP when leaving the MainGameScene.

2. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now handle the case where a creature is swapped in. If the opponent has queued an attack skill, the swapped-in creature immediately gets hit by that skill before any other actions are resolved.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the issues raised in the QA pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

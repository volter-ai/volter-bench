## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during the QA/testing phase. To address these concerns, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Strictly follow the order of actions as specified in the architecture:
   - Swap actions always occur before skill actions.
   - For skill actions, the creature with higher speed goes first.
   - In case of equal speed, randomly decide which creature goes first.

2. Remove the minimum damage of 1, as it's not specified in the architecture.

3. Remove the resetting of creature states at the end of a battle, as it's not specified in the architecture.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3bdfe8cb-ca9f-4288-89d9-af7e48328ab0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now strictly follows the order specified in the architecture:
   - Swap actions are executed first.
   - Skill actions are then executed based on the speed of the creatures, with a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.

2. In the `calculate_damage` method, we've removed the `max(1, final_damage)` check, allowing the damage to be 0 if the calculation results in that.

3. We've removed the `reset_creatures_state` method and its call at the end of the `run` method, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.

These changes bring the implementation in line with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The random run test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit after the battle ends. We'll transition back to the MainMenuScene after displaying the battle result.

2. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and use this in the main game loop.

3. We'll ensure that the scene exits properly in both the normal flow and when the random mode counter reaches zero.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: cd3bb521-6e3c-4d35-b2fa-87be421257d8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name}: HP {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp}

```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends in the `run` method.
2. Ensuring that the `_check_battle_end` method returns a boolean, which is used to break the main game loop when the battle ends.
3. Keeping the scene running until the battle naturally ends or the random mode counter reaches zero.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or when the random mode counter reaches zero. The solution adheres to the given architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

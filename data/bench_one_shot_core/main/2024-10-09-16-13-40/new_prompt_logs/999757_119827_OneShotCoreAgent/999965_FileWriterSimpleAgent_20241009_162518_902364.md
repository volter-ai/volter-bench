## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement the reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Implement the behavior of the swapped creature getting hit by its opponent's queued skill.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d6fbf637-cb1d-451f-b3bf-8fde5d45f0f9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name}: HP {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp}

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Implementing the reset of the player's creatures' state in the `_reset_creatures` method, which is called at the end of the `run` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.
2. Implementing the behavior of the swapped creature getting hit by its opponent's queued skill in the `_resolution_phase` method. When a swap occurs, we check if the opponent has a queued attack and immediately perform that attack on the newly swapped-in creature.

These changes should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA testing while adhering to the given architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The solution maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas and implementing all game logic within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

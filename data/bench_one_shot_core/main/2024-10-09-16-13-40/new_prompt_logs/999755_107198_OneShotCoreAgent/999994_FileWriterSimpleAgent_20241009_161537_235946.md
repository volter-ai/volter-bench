## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the foe, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and respects the architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 035429ee-031a-4e06-9c10-7c5b53fcdc05
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds the `reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. It's called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the MainGameScene, as required by the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

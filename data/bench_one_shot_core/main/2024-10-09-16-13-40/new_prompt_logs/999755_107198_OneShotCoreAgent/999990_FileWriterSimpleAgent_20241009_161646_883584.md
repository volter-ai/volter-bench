## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA report, we need to make the following changes to align the implementation more closely with the architecture documentation:

1. Display the foe's available skills during the Foe Choice Phase.
2. Implement a visible queue management for skills.
3. Remove the extra feature of resetting creatures' health after the battle, as it's not mentioned in the original architecture.

Here's how we'll fix these issues in the MainGameScene:

1. We'll modify the `__str__` method to include the foe's skills.
2. We'll create a `skill_queue` list to manage the queued skills.
3. We'll update the choice phases to add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
4. We'll modify the resolution phase to use the skill queue.
5. We'll remove the `reset_creatures_state` method and its call.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 120c71ba-0a3b-4016-9069-75bafcb687e2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

Foe's skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.foe_creature.skills])}

Skill Queue:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.skill_queue])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You chose {choice.thing.display_name}!")

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe chose {choice.thing.display_name}!")

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.foe_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `__str__` method now includes the foe's available skills.
2. A `skill_queue` list is implemented to manage the queued skills visibly.
3. The choice phases now add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
4. The resolution phase uses the skill queue to execute skills in order.
5. The extra feature of resetting creatures' health after the battle has been removed.

These changes bring the implementation more in line with the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

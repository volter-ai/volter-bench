## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Explicitly convert the final damage calculation from float to integer using the `int()` function.
2. Modify the `_end_battle` method to reset only the player's creatures, not the bot's.
3. Remove the turn counter as it's not mentioned in the architecture.
4. Add a comment explaining the handling of equal speed scenarios.

These changes will be made while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between data models and game logic.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The final damage calculation now explicitly converts the result to an integer using `int()`.
2. The `_end_battle` method now resets only the player's creatures, not the bot's.
3. The turn counter has been removed as it's not mentioned in the architecture.
4. A comment has been added to explain the handling of equal speed scenarios.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between data models and game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as it already contains pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

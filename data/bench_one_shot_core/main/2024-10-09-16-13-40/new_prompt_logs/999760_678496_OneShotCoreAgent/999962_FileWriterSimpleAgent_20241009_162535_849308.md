## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Implement random selection for equal speed scenarios in the Resolution Phase.
3. Make the conversion from float to integer explicit in damage calculation.
4. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.

These changes will be made while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between data models and game logic.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The 'Back' option is now included in both the main choice phase and the sub-choice phases (Attack and Swap).
2. Equal speed scenarios are now handled by randomly shuffling the actions when speeds are equal.
3. The conversion from float to integer in damage calculation is now explicit.
4. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is now implemented in the `_check_forced_swap` method, which is called after each action in the resolution phase.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between data models and game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as it already contains pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

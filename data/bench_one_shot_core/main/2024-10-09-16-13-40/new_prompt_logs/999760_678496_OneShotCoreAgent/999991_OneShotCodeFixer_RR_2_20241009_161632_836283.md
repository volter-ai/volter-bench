You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s handle a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.

This game is a small, free homage to the game Pokémon...  Sort of! Just don't use the word Pokémon anywhere in the game!
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. Each skill is checked and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the damage stat on the skill. Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed.

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```






Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements. Here's the plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations
   - Define `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`
   - Ensure proper ordering of class definitions to avoid circular dependencies

2. Create JSON files for content:
   - `main_game/content/skill.json`: Define the "Tackle" skill
   - `main_game/content/creature.json`: Define the "Bubwool" creature
   - `main_game/content/player.json`: Define the "Default Player"

3. Update `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement the `MainMenuScene` class with options to play or quit
   - Use `_transition_to_scene` to move to the `MainGameScene`

4. Create `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement the `MainGameScene` class with battle logic
   - Include player and foe choice phases, and resolution phase
   - Handle battle end conditions and transitions

5. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`
   - Implement `create_player` and `create_bot` methods

6. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Now, I'll proceed with writing out each file according to this plan.

These files implement the creature battler game according to the given specifications and guidelines. The game includes a main menu scene and a main game scene where players can battle against a bot using their creatures and skills. The implementation follows the provided architecture and adheres to the guidelines for models and scenes.

Content: To address the issue of skill queuing in the Resolution Phase, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to include explicit skill queuing and dequeuing. Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the queued skills.
2. Modify the `player_turn` and `foe_turn` methods to queue the selected skills instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the `resolve_turn` method to dequeue and execute the skills from the `skill_queue`.

This approach will align the implementation more closely with the architecture's requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by explicitly queuing skills during the player and foe turns, and then dequeuing and executing them during the resolution phase. The `skill_queue` is implemented as a list, which allows for easy addition and removal of skills. This change brings the implementation in line with the architecture's requirements while maintaining the overall functionality of the game.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The implementation closely follows the described architecture, but it lacks explicit handling for the 'knocked out' state of creatures when their HP reaches zero, and it does not address the scenario of simultaneous defeats. These discrepancies indicate that the code does not fully align with the architecture specifications.",

}



Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Role: assistant
Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Add a 'knocked_out' boolean attribute to the Creature model to explicitly track the creature's state.
2. Modify the MainGameScene to check for the 'knocked_out' state after each attack and handle it appropriately.
3. Implement logic to handle simultaneous defeats by checking both creatures' states after resolving all queued skills.

Here's the proposed solution:

1. First, we need to update the `models.py` file to include the 'knocked_out' attribute:

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]
    knocked_out: bool = False

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

2. Now, let's update the `main_game_scene.py` file to implement these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. We've added a 'knocked_out' boolean attribute to the Creature model.
2. The MainGameScene now checks for the 'knocked_out' state before allowing a creature to act or receive damage.
3. We've implemented a `check_knocked_out` method to handle the transition to the knocked-out state.
4. The `check_battle_end` method now handles the case of simultaneous defeats (draw).
5. The `reset_creatures` method now resets the 'knocked_out' state along with the HP.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns more closely with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The scene is not calling `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene` when it should, causing the test to fail.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will either transition to a new scene or quit the game.
2. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method to break out of the loop when the battle ends.
3. We'll update the `run` method to call the new end-of-battle handling method after the battle loop ends.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3cfd463f-50e3-4ccf-ac29-3effa1ce1090
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._handle_battle_end()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while not self._check_battle_end():
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = max(0, attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        # Ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])
        
        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Modifying the `battle_loop` to continue until the battle ends (using `_check_battle_end`).
2. Adding a `_handle_battle_end` method that displays the battle result and asks the player if they want to play again or quit.
3. Updating the `run` method to call `_handle_battle_end` after the battle loop finishes.
4. Ensuring that the scene always ends with either a transition to another scene or by quitting the game.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits or transitions when the battle ends.

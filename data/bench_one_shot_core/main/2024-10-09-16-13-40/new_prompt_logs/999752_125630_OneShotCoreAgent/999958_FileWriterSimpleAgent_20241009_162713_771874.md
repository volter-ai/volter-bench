## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue. The current implementation doesn't handle the case where a swapped-in creature gets hit by the opponent's queued skill. To fix this, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll change the order of resolution to always execute swap actions before attack actions.
2. If a player swaps, we'll immediately apply the opponent's queued attack to the swapped-in creature if the opponent chose to attack.
3. We'll then resolve any remaining attacks.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a48d2c2f-eafb-439c-adda-03ae2f40fc3a

        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Separating the resolution of swap actions and attack actions.
2. Executing all swap actions first.
3. If a player swaps and the opponent chose to attack, immediately executing the opponent's attack on the swapped-in creature.
4. Then executing any remaining attacks.

This ensures that swapped-in creatures get hit by the opponent's queued skill, as specified in the architecture documentation. The changes are confined to the `MainGameScene` class and do not require modifications to the models, maintaining the pure data schema nature of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

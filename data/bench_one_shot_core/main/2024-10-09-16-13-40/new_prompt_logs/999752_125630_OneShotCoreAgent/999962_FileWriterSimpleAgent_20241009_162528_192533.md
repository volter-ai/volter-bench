## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random resolution of equal speeds by adding a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.
2. Explicitly convert damage from float to integer in the damage calculation.
3. Add a method to reset the player's creatures' state after leaving the MainGameScene.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7b7b6fe7-ef94-4775-ab86-fd614d3c90bd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_action = None
        self.bot_action = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp})

        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. Random resolution of equal speeds: In the `resolution_phase` method, we now sort players based on both speed and a random factor. This ensures that when speeds are equal, the order is determined randomly.

2. Explicit conversion of damage to integer: In the `calculate_damage` method, we now explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using `int()`.

3. Reset of player's creatures' state: We've added a new `reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP and sets the active creature back to the first creature in the list. This method is called after the battle ends and before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes maintain the structure of the game and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the specific issues raised in the QA pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

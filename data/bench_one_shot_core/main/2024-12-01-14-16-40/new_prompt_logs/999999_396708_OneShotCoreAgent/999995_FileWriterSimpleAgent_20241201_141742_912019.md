Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene when needed

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: 7efba16f-f730-46d1-bf72-dd359b854f85
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    damage: int
    category: str = "Skill"

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]
    category: str = "Creature"

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    category: str = "Player"
```

# Excerpt ID: c2c63d69-f5a5-4ddb-9a9a-82cdda19bba1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Bot choice phase
            self._show_text(self.bot, "Enemy turn!")
            bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, bot_skill)

            # Check win conditions
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the reset logic directly into MainGameScene's run() method
3. Kept models as pure data schemas
4. Maintained all game logic within the scene

This should resolve the test failures while maintaining proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

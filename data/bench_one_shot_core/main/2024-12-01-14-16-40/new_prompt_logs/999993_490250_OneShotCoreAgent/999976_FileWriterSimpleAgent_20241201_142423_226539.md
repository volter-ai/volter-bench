Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me describe the fix:

1. Looking at the architecture docs, specifically `main_game_scene.md`, it states:
"When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

2. The fix needs to:
- Reset HP of all creatures to their max_hp value
- This should happen before the scene ends
- Since models are pure data schemas, we do this in the scene code
- We need to reset both player and opponent creatures

3. Implementation approach:
- Add a reset_creatures method in MainGameScene
- Call it before _quit_whole_game()
- Reset HP to max_hp for all creatures

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added reset_creatures() method to handle resetting creature HP
2. Called reset_creatures() before _quit_whole_game() in run()
3. Kept models as pure data schemas by handling state reset in the scene
4. Maintained proper scene flow control

This ensures creatures are reset to their initial state before the scene ends, as required by the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

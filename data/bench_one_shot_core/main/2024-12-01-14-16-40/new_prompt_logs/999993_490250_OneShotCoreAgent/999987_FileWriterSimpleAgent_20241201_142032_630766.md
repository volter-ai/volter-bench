Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `self.queued_skills`, but AbstractThing objects cannot be used as dictionary keys (they raise FixableException when __hash__ is called). Instead, we should use the player's uid as the key.

The fix needs to be in main_game_scene.py. Here's the corrected version:

# Excerpt ID: 1a459e62-7648-4ab7-bd72-733c55fe37a1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will use player.uid as key instead of player object

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
            self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = player_skill.thing

            # Opponent phase
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])
            self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid] = opponent_skill.thing

            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn()

            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def resolve_turn(self):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player
        second = self.opponent
        if self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first, second = second, first
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

        # Execute skills in order
        for attacker in [first, second]:
            defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature if attacker == self.player else self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
            
            skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]  # Use uid instead of player object
            damage = self.calculate_damage(skill, attacker_creature, defender_creature)
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
            
            self._show_text(self.player, 
                f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.player]` to `self.queued_skills[self.player.uid]`
2. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.opponent]` to `self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid]`
3. Changed `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker]` to `skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]`

This maintains the same functionality but uses string UIDs as dictionary keys instead of trying to use AbstractThing objects as keys. This follows the engine's guidelines about not using AbstractThing objects as hashable values.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

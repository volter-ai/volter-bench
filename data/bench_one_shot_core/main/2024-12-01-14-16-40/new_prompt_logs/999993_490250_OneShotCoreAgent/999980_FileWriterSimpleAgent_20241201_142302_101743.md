Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it needs to call either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()` when the battle ends, rather than just breaking from the loop.

Looking at the architecture, since this is a simple game, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends to properly terminate the game session.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when `check_battle_end()` returns True. This ensures the game properly terminates when the battle is over, rather than just breaking from the loop.

This follows the engine's architecture by:
1. Using the proper scene termination method
2. Maintaining the game flow control within the scene
3. Not modifying any models or core engine functionality
4. Properly signaling game completion to the engine

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

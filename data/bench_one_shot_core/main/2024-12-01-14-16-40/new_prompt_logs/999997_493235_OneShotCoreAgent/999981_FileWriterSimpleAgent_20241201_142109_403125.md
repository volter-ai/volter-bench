Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're getting a dict instead of a Skill object for the opponent's skill choice. This is happening because we're using DictionaryChoice.value directly without converting it back to a Skill object.

The fix is to modify the opponent choice handling in MainGameScene to match how we handle the player's choice - by finding the corresponding Skill object from the creature's skills list.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 711019c6-9d57-492c-a53b-4843c7184471
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
            
        # Calculate type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},

        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)
        second_creature.hp = max(0, second_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        if second_creature.hp <= 0:
            return

            skill_choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, 
                [DictionaryChoice(s.display_name) for s in self.opponent_creature.skills])
            opponent_skill = next(s for s in self.opponent_creature.skills if s.display_name == opponent_choice.display_name)

            # Resolution phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed opponent skill selection to match player skill selection pattern
2. Removed direct use of .value from DictionaryChoice
3. Added proper lookup of Skill object from creature's skills list

This maintains the proper model relationships while fixing the dict vs object issue that was causing the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

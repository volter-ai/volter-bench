Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in our test. The test is running into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, eventually hitting quit_whole_game(). We need to:

- Modify the test to properly catch and handle both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
- Add proper mocking of scene transitions to prevent infinite loops
- Follow the pattern shown in test_main_menu_scene.py where transitions are mocked

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 95b1ef1e-10cb-4f69-a267-38b9c4fd66e7
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods to catch either way the scene might end
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting via quit_whole_game")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for all possible exit paths (TransitionFromScene, RandomModeGracefulExit, and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame)
2. Added mocking of both transition and quit methods to prevent infinite loops
3. Added proper cleanup in the finally block
4. Added better logging to help debug test runs
5. Followed the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py for consistency

This ensures the test can properly handle the scene transitions and exits without getting stuck in an infinite loop between scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:

The issue is that we need to reset creature states when transitioning out of MainGameScene. According to the architecture, we need to reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the battle scene.

Since models must be pure data schemas without methods, we can't add reset methods to the Creature class. Instead, we should:

1. Store the initial max_hp as the creature's hp when creating from prototype
2. In MainGameScene, before transitioning back to MainMenuScene, reset the hp of both player's and opponent's creatures back to their max_hp values

This maintains the pure data schema nature of the models while ensuring creatures are reset properly between battles.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self.reset_creatures()  # Reset creatures before transitioning
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self.reset_creatures()  # Reset creatures before transitioning
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Added reset_creatures() method to handle resetting creature HP
2. Called reset_creatures() before each transition back to MainMenuScene
3. Reset both player and opponent creatures to ensure clean state for next battle

This maintains the pure data schema nature of the models while properly implementing the reset requirement from the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

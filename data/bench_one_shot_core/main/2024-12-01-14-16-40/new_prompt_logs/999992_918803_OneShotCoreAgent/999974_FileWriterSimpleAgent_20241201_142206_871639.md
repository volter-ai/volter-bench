Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because main.py is trying to import MainGameScene but the file doesn't exist yet. We need to:
- Remove the MainGameScene import from main.py until we implement it
- Only register scenes that actually exist
- Start with just the MainMenuScene working first, then add MainGameScene later

2. Here's the fixed main.py:

# Excerpt ID: c89699bc-1549-4ddb-a33f-6ff040ba6a24
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Only register scenes that exist for now
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This fixes the immediate error by removing the non-existent import. Once we implement MainGameScene, we can add back:
1. The import at the top
2. The scene registration in __init__

This follows the principle of only importing and registering components that actually exist. The tests should now run since they only depend on MainMenuScene which is fully implemented.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing MainGameScene next?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

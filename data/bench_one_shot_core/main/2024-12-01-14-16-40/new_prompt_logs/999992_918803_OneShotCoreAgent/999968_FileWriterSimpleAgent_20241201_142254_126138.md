Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is not registered in the App class, but MainMenuScene tries to transition to it. The fix requires:
- Importing MainGameScene in main.py
- Registering MainGameScene in App's __init__ method
- Keeping the scene registration consistent with the scene transitions

2. Here's the fixed main.py:

# Excerpt ID: 6a060a33-8ec7-45b8-b803-683f72816425
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Register both scenes - MainMenuScene as entry point and MainGameScene for battle
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This fix:
1. Imports MainGameScene properly
2. Registers MainGameScene in App's __init__ method
3. Maintains the scene transition flow from MainMenuScene -> MainGameScene
4. Keeps all the model and architecture patterns intact
5. Works within the engine's capabilities

The error should now be resolved since the scene transition system will find MainGameScene properly registered when MainMenuScene attempts to transition to it.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

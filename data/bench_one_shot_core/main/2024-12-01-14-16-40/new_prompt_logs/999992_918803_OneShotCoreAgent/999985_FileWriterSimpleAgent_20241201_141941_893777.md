Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception that occurs when the game ends normally. The test should catch this exception as a valid end state, just like it catches `RandomModeGracefulExit`.

Looking at the test output, we can see the game is working correctly - battles happen, transitions work, and eventually the quit command is chosen in the main menu. We just need to handle this graceful exit in our test.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 9084d9ee-abf6-4dba-a785-836e99c10c46
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle might take more turns

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
```

The changes:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access the `_QuitWholeGame` exception
2. Added an except clause to catch `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added print statement to show when game ends gracefully

This fix:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Doesn't modify any models
- Properly handles the expected game termination
- Maintains the random testing approach
- Allows the test to pass when the game ends either through random mode timeout or through normal quit

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because DictionaryChoice is being used incorrectly. The error shows "got an unexpected keyword argument 'id'" which means we're trying to construct it wrong. Looking at the engine code:

- DictionaryChoice is meant to store simple key-value pairs
- We should use its `value` property to store the action data
- We shouldn't try to validate it as a model since it's a simple choice container

The fix requires:
- Modify MainGameScene to use DictionaryChoice correctly
- Store the action data in the value property directly
- Remove the model_validate call which is causing the error

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Removed model_validate calls
2. Properly construct DictionaryChoice with display_name
3. Set the value property directly instead of trying to validate it
4. Kept all the game logic and flow the same
5. Maintained proper use of engine components

This should resolve the TypeError while keeping all the functionality intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

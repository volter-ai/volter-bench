Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue with Normal type handling.

The issue is in the `get_type_multiplier` method in `main_game_scene.py`. Currently, it defaults to 1.0 for any type not in the effectiveness dictionary, which technically works for Normal type but isn't explicitly handling it as specified in the architecture.

According to the docs:
> "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

I'll modify the `get_type_multiplier` method to explicitly handle Normal type skills, making it clear in the code that Normal type has no special effectiveness against any type.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key change is in the `get_type_multiplier` method, where I've added explicit handling of the "normal" type at the start of the method. This makes it clear in the code that normal type skills are intentionally neutral (multiplier of 1.0) against all defender types, rather than just falling through to the default case.

This change:
1. Explicitly implements the architecture specification for Normal type
2. Makes the code's intent clearer
3. Maintains all other functionality
4. Stays within the engine's capabilities
5. Doesn't require any changes to the models or other parts of the code

The fix is isolated to the scene logic where it belongs, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

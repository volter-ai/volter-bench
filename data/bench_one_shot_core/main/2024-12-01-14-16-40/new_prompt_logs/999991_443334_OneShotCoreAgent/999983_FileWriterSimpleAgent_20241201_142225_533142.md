Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game.

According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- _transition_to_scene() to go to another scene
- _quit_whole_game() to end the game entirely

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when check_battle_end() returns True (meaning someone won), we should transition back to MainMenuScene instead of just breaking the loop.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the run() method where we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends instead of just breaking the loop. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must always end with an explicit transition or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

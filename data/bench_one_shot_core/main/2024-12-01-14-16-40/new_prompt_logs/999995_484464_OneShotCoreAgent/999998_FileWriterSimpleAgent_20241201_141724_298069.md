Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help create the creature battler game. Let me plan out the implementation:

1. First, we need the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (base damage)
- Creature (hp, max_hp, attack, defense, speed, skills collection)
- Player (creatures collection)

2. We need JSON files in content/ for each model:
- skill.json (with tackle prototype)
- creature.json (with bubwool and scizard prototypes)
- player.json (with default player and basic opponent prototypes)

3. We need two scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene)
- MainGameScene (needs to be created with battle logic)

4. Tests for both scenes using random mode

Let's implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines:
1. Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
2. Models reference other models directly, not by string IDs
3. Models are ordered by dependencies
4. Scene logic is contained in scenes
5. Scenes use transition methods
6. Scene tests use random mode
7. Scene __str__ methods show all relevant info
8. Models are created using from_prototype_id
9. Bots are created with create_bot and treated same as players

The game implements the full creature battle system with:
- Turn-based combat
- Speed-based turn order
- Damage calculation
- HP tracking
- Win/loss conditions
- Menu system

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the missing `active_creature` in the Player model. The error occurs because the `Player` model expects an `active_creature` attribute, but it's not being set when creating a player from the prototype.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `Player` model in `models.py` to make `active_creature` an optional field. This way, we can create a player without immediately setting an active creature.

2. We'll update the `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

Here's the updated `models.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: e04f82f7-cf2c-4e8c-953d-99946609c210
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes `active_creature` an optional field with a default value of `None`. This allows us to create a `Player` instance without specifying an `active_creature` initially.

Now, we need to update the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` at the start of the battle. Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: d0d2e812-16d0-4bce-9e43-c12aeaf9daa2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        for player in [self.player, self.bot]:

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes should resolve the issue by making the `active_creature` field optional in the `Player` model and ensuring it's set at the beginning of the battle in the `MainGameScene`. The rest of the game logic remains the same, but now it can handle the case where a player might not have an active creature initially.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the `AttributeError` occurring when trying to access the `display_name` attribute of a `SelectThing` object. This error is happening because we're treating both `Button` and `SelectThing` objects the same way, but they have different structures.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to handle `Button` and `SelectThing` objects differently.
2. Instead of checking for `display_name`, we'll check if the choice is an instance of `Button` for the "Back" option.
3. For `SelectThing` objects, we'll access the `thing` attribute directly.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

```

This updated implementation addresses the `AttributeError` by:

1. Using `isinstance()` to check if the choice is a `Button` or `SelectThing`.
2. Accessing the `display_name` attribute only for `Button` objects.
3. Accessing the `thing` attribute for `SelectThing` objects.

These changes should resolve the `AttributeError` while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

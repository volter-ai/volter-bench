## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `_player_choice_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class, specifically when trying to swap creatures. The problem occurs when all creatures except the active one have zero HP, leaving no available creatures to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the "Swap" option.
2. We'll add a check to ensure that if a player has no available actions (can't attack or swap), they automatically forfeit the battle.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: d2ba2b05-7fac-44ed-aac2-e36430359fb1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name if player_creature else 'No active creature'}: HP {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp if player_creature else 0}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {bot_creature.display_name if bot_creature else 'No active creature'}: HP {bot_creature.hp}/{bot_creature.max_hp if bot_creature else 0}

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Checking if there are available actions (attack or swap) before presenting choices to the player.
2. Returning `None` from `_player_choice_phase` if there are no available actions, which is then handled in the `run` method to end the battle.
3. Only offering the "Swap" option if there are creatures available to swap to.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

These modifications should resolve the `AssertionError` by ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. It also adds a mechanism to end the battle when a player has no available actions, which is a logical conclusion to the game when all creatures are defeated or the active creature can't attack.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

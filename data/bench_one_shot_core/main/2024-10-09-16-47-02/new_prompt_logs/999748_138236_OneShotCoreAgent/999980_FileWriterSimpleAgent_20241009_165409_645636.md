## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, either through transition or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll modify the `run` method to use this new end-of-battle handling.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f76cbac7-e337-4e42-8dba-78dc453cadf2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        # Reset creature HP
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        
        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean instead of handling the end-of-battle logic.
2. Adding a new `end_battle` method that handles showing the battle result, resetting creature HP, and transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Updating the `run` method to call `end_battle` when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.

These modifications should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the problem of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The battle will now always end by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, allowing the game to continue running or be exited from the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the necessary fixes.

1. Describing the fixes:

a) Adding 'Normal' type to weakness-resistance factor calculation:
We'll update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to include the 'Normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

b) Addressing potential floating-point precision issues in special attack damage calculation:
We'll use `round()` function to ensure consistent rounding of the special attack damage calculation.

c) Ensuring equal probability for random selection when speeds are equal:
We'll use `random.randint(0, 1)` instead of `random.choice([True, False])` to guarantee equal probability over many trials.

d) Addressing the 'normal' type for skills:
We'll keep the 'normal' type as it's part of the skill prototypes, but we'll ensure it's properly handled in the weakness-resistance calculation.

e) Resetting opponent's creature HP:
We'll remove the opponent's creature HP reset at the end of the battle to align with the architecture specifications.

2. Rewriting the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: b4d6e85a-9945-454c-ad64-aec86598c1fb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5},
            "normal": {}  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        # Reset only the player's creature HP
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        
        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The 'Normal' type is now included in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
2. The special attack damage calculation now uses `round()` to avoid floating-point precision issues.
3. `random.randint(0, 1)` is used instead of `random.choice([True, False])` for equal probability in speed tie-breaks.
4. The 'normal' type is properly handled in the weakness-resistance calculation.
5. The opponent's creature HP is no longer reset at the end of the battle.

These changes maintain the core functionality while addressing the discrepancies noted in the QA report, aligning the implementation more closely with the specified architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

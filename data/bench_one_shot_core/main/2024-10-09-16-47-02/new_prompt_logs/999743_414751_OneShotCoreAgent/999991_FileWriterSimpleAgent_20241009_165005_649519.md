## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is happening because the game loop in MainGameScene ends after a battle concludes, but it doesn't transition to another scene or quit the game.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends.
2. Add a method to display the battle result before transitioning.
3. Ensure that the game loop continues until explicitly told to quit.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: a1d8160c-075b-454c-9bb1-ebc181296b12
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_result = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.display_battle_result()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.battle_result = "lose"
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.battle_result = "win"
            return True
        return False

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.battle_result == "win":
            self._show_text(self.player, "Congratulations! You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle. Better luck next time!")
        
        # Add a small delay to allow the player to read the result
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle continues until one creature's HP reaches 0.
2. Once the battle ends, it displays the result to the player.
3. After displaying the result, it transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
4. The game loop in the run method will exit only after transitioning to another scene.

This should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The game will now properly cycle between the main menu and battles, allowing for multiple playthroughs without crashing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

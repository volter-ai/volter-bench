## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both discrepancies in the MainGameScene implementation. Here's how I plan to fix them:

1. For the resolution phase, I'll add a check for equal speeds and use random.choice to determine the order when speeds are equal.
2. For skill execution, I'll use floats throughout the damage calculation process and only convert to an integer at the final step.

Here's the updated MainGameScene implementation:

# Excerpt ID: c9a99db1-42d8-4596-9f52-c3102726e67f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):

        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Equal speeds, randomly choose order
            creatures_skills = [(self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures_skills, 2)

        self._execute_skill(*first, second[0])

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):

        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(True)

        return False

    def _end_battle(self, player_won):
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")

        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address both issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we now check for equal speeds and use `random.sample` to determine the order when speeds are equal.
2. In the `_execute_skill` method, we now use floats for all calculations up until the final damage calculation, where we convert to an integer.

The rest of the implementation remains the same, maintaining consistency with the models and architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

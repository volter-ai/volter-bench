## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem of the MainGameScene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The main issue is that the game ends when a player wins, but we're not properly transitioning out of the scene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the `run` method continues to loop until a transition occurs.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 125b4352-01c1-45c5-ae6e-3e7e7745d7ed
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

```

This solution addresses the main issue by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
3. Resetting the creatures' HP after the battle ends.
4. Ensuring that the `run` method continues to loop until a transition occurs.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and allow the game to properly transition between scenes, fixing the test failure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The main problem is that the `MainGameScene` is not properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle ends. This causes the scene to terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is an antipattern in our game engine.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll add a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after showing the battle result.
2. We'll also add a short delay using `time.sleep()` before transitioning, to allow the player to see the battle result.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 21818dd0-1649-470b-ad9f-e65f04b255a0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)

        if not self.check_battle_end():

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1), (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, creature1, skill1, self.opponent, creature2), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2, self.player, creature1)
            else:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Give the player time to see the result
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Give the player time to see the result
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, either in victory or defeat. The added `time.sleep(2)` gives the player a moment to see the battle result before transitioning.

This change should resolve the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error and allow the game to continue running properly in both the random test runs and the full game flow test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each of these issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation between data models and game logic. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. Randomly resolving equal speeds: I'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use `random.shuffle()` on the list of actions before sorting by speed. This will randomize the order of actions with equal speed.

2. Converting final damage to an integer: I'll explicitly convert the final damage to an integer in the `_calculate_damage` method.

3. Adding a specific message for the losing player: I'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to show separate messages for the winning and losing players.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 11c327c1-10a0-4390-895b-1dc8ff3f4f22

        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now uses `random.shuffle()` to randomize the order of actions before sorting by speed, which will resolve equal speeds randomly.
2. The `_calculate_damage` method now explicitly converts the final damage to an integer using `int()`.
3. The `_check_battle_end` method now shows separate messages for the winning and losing players.

These modifications maintain the separation between data models and game logic, and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `Player` and `Creature` models remain pure data schemas, while all game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

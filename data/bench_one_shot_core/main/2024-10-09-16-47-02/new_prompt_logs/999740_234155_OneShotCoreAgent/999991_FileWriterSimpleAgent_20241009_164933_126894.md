## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I understand the issues raised during QA/testing, and I'll address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Implement random order selection when creatures have the same speed:
   - In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to check if the creatures have the same speed.
   - If they do, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first.

2. Add an explicit welcome message in the `MainMenuScene`:
   - We'll modify the `run` method of `MainMenuScene` to show a welcome message using `self._show_text` before entering the game loop.

Now, let's rewrite the necessary files with these changes:

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to Creature Battler!")
        self.game_loop()

        while True:
            play_button = Button("Play")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [play_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if play_button == choice:

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:

        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The `resolution_phase` method in `MainGameScene` now includes logic to randomly determine the order of attacks when creatures have the same speed.
2. The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` now shows an explicit welcome message using `self._show_text` before entering the game loop.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA feedback while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The implementation now fully aligns with the described architecture and requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

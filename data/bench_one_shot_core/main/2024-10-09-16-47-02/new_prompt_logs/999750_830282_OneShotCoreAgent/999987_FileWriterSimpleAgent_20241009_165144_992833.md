## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the Resolution Phase in the MainGameScene to implement the random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal. This change will align with the specified architecture and improve the fairness and variability of battles.

Here's how I will fix the issue:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method of the MainGameScene, I will add a condition to check if the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal.
2. If the speeds are equal, I will use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. I will then execute the skills based on this random decision when speeds are equal, maintaining the existing logic for cases where speeds are not equal.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

```

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene now includes the random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal, as specified in the architecture. The `_resolution_phase` method now has three conditions:

1. When the player's creature is faster
2. When the opponent's creature is faster
3. When the speeds are equal (new condition)

In the case of equal speeds, it randomly chooses which creature goes first using `random.choice()`. This change should address the issue raised during QA/testing and improve the fairness and variability of battles when creatures have the same speed.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

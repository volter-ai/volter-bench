## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix each issue:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Implement action execution based on creature speed.
3. Add random turn order for creatures with the same speed.
4. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. The `models.py` file won't need modification as it already contains the necessary data schemas without methods or properties.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. The 'Back' option is now available in both the main choice phase and the attack/swap sub-menus.
2. Action execution is now based on creature speed, with faster creatures acting first.
3. Random turn order is implemented for creatures with the same speed.
4. The state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the scene in the `end_game` method.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as it already contains the necessary data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner during the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After a battle ends (when a creature faints), we'll add logic to either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until an exit condition is met, rather than breaking out of the loop prematurely.

Here's how we'll implement these changes in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: e2ba3090-a1f8-4058-9f07-f0629fe330bd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while True:
            battle_result = self._battle_round()
            if battle_result:
                self._end_battle(battle_result)
                break

    def _battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
        return self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
        for attacker, defender, skill in [first, second]:
            damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
            defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} and deals {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")
            if defender.hp == 0:
                winner = self.player if defender == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} fainted! {winner.display_name} wins!")
                return winner
        return None

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed or (creature1.speed == creature2.speed and random.choice([True, False])):
            return (creature1, creature2, skill1), (creature2, creature1, skill2)
        else:
            return (creature2, creature1, skill2), (creature1, creature2, skill1)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        effectiveness = self._get_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * effectiveness)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _end_battle(self, winner):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle ended! {winner.display_name} is victorious!")
        choices = [
            Button("Play Again"),
            Button("Quit")
        ]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        if choice.display_name == "Play Again":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle continues until there's a winner.
2. After the battle ends, the player is given a choice to play again or quit.
3. Based on the player's choice, the game either transitions back to the MainMenuScene or quits entirely.

This implementation should resolve both issues:
- The scene will always exit properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
- The random run test should now pass, as the scene will exit in an expected manner.

The changes maintain the existing architecture and work within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

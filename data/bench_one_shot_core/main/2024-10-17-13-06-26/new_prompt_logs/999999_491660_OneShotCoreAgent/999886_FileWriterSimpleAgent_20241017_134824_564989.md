## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Add logic for executing skills based on speed and resolving ties randomly.
3. Handle swapping creatures before skill execution.
4. Implement logic for a swapped-in creature getting hit by the opponent's queued skill.
5. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. Add a 'Back' option to the attack and swap menus.
2. Create a new method `resolve_turn` to handle the speed-based skill execution and random tie-breaking.
3. Modify the `execute_action` method to handle swapping before skill execution.
4. Update the `execute_swap` method to apply damage from a queued skill if applicable.
5. Add a `reset_creatures` method to be called when leaving the scene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

This implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the attack and swap menus.
2. The `resolve_turn` method now handles skill execution based on speed and resolves ties randomly.
3. The `execute_action` method now handles swapping before skill execution.
4. The logic for a swapped-in creature getting hit by the opponent's queued skill is implemented in the `execute_action` method.
5. The `reset_creatures` method is called at the end of the battle to reset the state of all creatures.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

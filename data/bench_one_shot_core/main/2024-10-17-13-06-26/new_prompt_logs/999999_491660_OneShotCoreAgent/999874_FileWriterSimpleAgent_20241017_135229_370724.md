## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised in the test failures, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to properly handle the end of the game. The main problems are:

1. The scene is not exiting in an expected manner (not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`).
2. The scene is terminating without properly signaling the end of the game.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until the battle ends.
2. We'll add a call to `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends.
3. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a tuple indicating whether the battle has ended and who the winner is.
4. We'll use this information to display the final result and quit the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop continues until a winner is determined.
2. Properly handling the end of the game by calling `self._quit_whole_game()`.
3. Displaying the final result to the player before ending the game.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified, as it already contains the necessary data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

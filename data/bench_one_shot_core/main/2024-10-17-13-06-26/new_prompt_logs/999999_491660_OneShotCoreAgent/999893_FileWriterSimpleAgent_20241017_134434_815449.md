## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to properly handle the end of the battle by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` or quitting the game.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a proper exit condition is met.
3. We'll add a check for when all creatures of either player are defeated, and end the game accordingly.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 0cf0c2ce-ad02-4278-ab8e-68fa0b00119c

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Properly handling the end of the battle in the `check_battle_end` method.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that presents the player with options to play again or quit the game.
3. Using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to return to the main menu if the player chooses to play again.
4. Using `self._quit_whole_game()` to exit the game if the player chooses to quit.

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve the issues raised in the test failures and adhere to the engine's requirements for scene transitions and game flow.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

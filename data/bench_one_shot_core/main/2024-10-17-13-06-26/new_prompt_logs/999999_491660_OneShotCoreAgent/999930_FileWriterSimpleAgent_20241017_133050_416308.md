## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning or quitting correctly after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _check_battle_end method to transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game when the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the run method in MainGameScene continues to loop until the battle ends and the scene transitions or quits.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and the game flow continues as expected. Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: b1dd5ece-cf09-4414-8abe-1124d677e6ae
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            self._player_choice_phase()
            if not self.battle_ended:
                self._foe_choice_phase()
            if not self.battle_ended:
                self._resolution_phase()

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill = choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.opponent_skill = choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self.battle_ended:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self.battle_ended:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        factor = self._get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")
        self._check_battle_end()

    def _get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type: str, creature_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle continues in a loop until it ends.
2. When the battle ends, it properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The scene doesn't exit unexpectedly, addressing the "scene was not exited in an expected manner" error.
4. The game flow continues correctly after the battle ends.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

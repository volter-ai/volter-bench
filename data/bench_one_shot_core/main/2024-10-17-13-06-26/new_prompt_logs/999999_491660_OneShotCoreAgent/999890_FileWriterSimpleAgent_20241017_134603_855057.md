## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the problem where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `get_swap_action` method of the `MainGameScene` class when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `get_player_action` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the "Swap" option.
2. We'll add a method to check for available creatures.
3. We'll update the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to handle the case where no action is possible (i.e., when the active creature is fainted and there are no creatures to swap to).

Here's the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `has_available_creatures` method to check if a player has any creatures available for swapping.
2. Modifying the `get_player_action` method to only offer choices that are actually available (Attack if the active creature has HP, Swap if there are available creatures).
3. Updating the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to handle cases where no action is possible.
4. Ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices.

These changes should resolve the AssertionError and allow the game to progress even when a player has no valid actions available. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

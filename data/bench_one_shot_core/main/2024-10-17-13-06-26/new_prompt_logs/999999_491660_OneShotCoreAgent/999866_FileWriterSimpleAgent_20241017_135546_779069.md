## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not explicitly prioritizing swaps over skills in the resolution phase, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. I will separate the swap actions from the skill actions in the resolution phase.
2. I will execute all swap actions first, before executing any skill actions.
3. I will maintain the speed-based ordering for skill actions, with random tiebreakers for equal speeds.

This solution aligns with the specified logic in the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified as it already contains the necessary data schemas without methods or properties.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by explicitly prioritizing swap actions over skill actions in the resolution phase. The `resolve_actions` method now executes all swap actions first, followed by skill actions based on creature speed. This aligns with the specified logic in the architecture while maintaining the existing structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

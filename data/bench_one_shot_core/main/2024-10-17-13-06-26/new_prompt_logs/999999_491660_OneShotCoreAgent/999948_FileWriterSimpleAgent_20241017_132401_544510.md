## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`, which is required by the engine to properly end or transition between scenes.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the `MainMenuScene` or quit the whole game.
3. We'll wrap the main battle loop in a while True loop to ensure the scene doesn't terminate unexpectedly.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

This updated `MainGameScene` class addresses the issue by:

1. Wrapping the main battle loop in a while True loop to ensure the scene doesn't terminate unexpectedly.
2. After each battle ends, it prompts the player to choose between playing again or quitting.
3. If the player chooses to quit, it calls `self._quit_whole_game()`, which properly ends the game.
4. If the player chooses to play again, it resets the creatures' HP and starts a new battle.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game, which should resolve the test failures and meet the engine's requirements.

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

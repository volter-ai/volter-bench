## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the battle_loop to call this transition method when the battle is over.
3. We'll ensure that the run method continues to loop until the battle is over.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 5e75d4f8-0a59-4817-9098-8d7fc16d2707
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.battle_over = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        while not self.battle_over:
            self.battle_loop()
        self.end_battle()

    def battle_loop(self):
        # Player turn
        player_skill = self.choose_skill(self.player, self.player_creature)
        
        # Bot turn
        bot_skill = self.choose_skill(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
        
        # Resolution phase
        self.resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
        
        self.battle_over = self.check_battle_end()

    def choose_skill(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} uses {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `run` method now continues to loop until the battle is over.
2. We've added an `end_battle` method that resets the creatures and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The `battle_loop` method now sets the `battle_over` flag when the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the scene properly exits and transitions after the battle ends, which should resolve both the assertion error in the test_main_game_scene.py and the FixableException in test_whole_game.py.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

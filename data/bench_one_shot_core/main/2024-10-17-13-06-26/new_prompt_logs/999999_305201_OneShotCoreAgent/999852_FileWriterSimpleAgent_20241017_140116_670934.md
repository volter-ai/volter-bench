## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AssertionError that occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with no choices. This error is happening in the `_choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem is likely due to all creatures being knocked out or having zero HP, leaving no valid choices for swapping.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_choose_swap` method, we'll add a check to see if there are any available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, we'll handle the case where `_choose_swap` returns `None`.
4. If swapping is not possible, we'll force the player to choose an attack instead.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        self._perform_swap(player, new_creature)
        return True
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. If there are no creatures available to swap, the player is forced to choose an attack instead. This should resolve the AssertionError and allow the game to continue even when a player has no valid swap options.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

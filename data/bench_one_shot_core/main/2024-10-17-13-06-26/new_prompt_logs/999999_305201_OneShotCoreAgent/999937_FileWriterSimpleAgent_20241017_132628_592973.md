## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop to break and transition when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 9bee5ba8-cfa6-4c7f-97a1-83bb523f03dd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures_hp(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Breaking the game loop when the battle ends.
3. Resetting the creatures' HP after each battle to prepare for potential future battles.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The game flow should now be more robust and consistent with the expected behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue. The resolution phase is not correctly prioritizing swaps over attacks as specified in the architecture documents. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated `main_game_scene.py` file.

1. How to fix the issue:

We need to modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class to prioritize swaps over attacks, regardless of the creatures' speed. Here's how we'll do it:

a) Separate the actions into swaps and attacks.
b) Execute all swaps first, in the order they were chosen.
c) Then execute attacks, ordered by the speed of the active creatures.

This approach will ensure that swaps are always executed before attacks, as specified in the architecture documents.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: be03db80-10af-4aeb-8cc6-6fd19698bbaa

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by modifying the `resolve_turn` method to prioritize swaps over attacks, as specified in the architecture documents. Swaps are now executed first, followed by attacks ordered by creature speed. This ensures that the resolution phase aligns with the described architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

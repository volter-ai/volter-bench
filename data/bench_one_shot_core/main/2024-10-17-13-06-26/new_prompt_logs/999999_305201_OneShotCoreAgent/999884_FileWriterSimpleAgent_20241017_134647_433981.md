## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `get_swap_choice` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures are either knocked out or already active, leaving no available creatures to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. Modify the `get_swap_choice` method to handle the case where there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list.
3. Update the `get_player_action` method to handle the case where `get_swap_choice` returns `None`.
4. If swapping is not possible, we'll force the player to choose the "Attack" option.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

    def initialize_battle(self):

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        effectiveness = {

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if all(c.hp == 0 for c in self.player.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif all(c.hp == 0 for c in self.opponent.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issue where `_wait_for_choice` was being called with no choices. Now, if there are no creatures available to swap, the player will be forced to attack instead. This should prevent the AssertionError we were seeing in the tests.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

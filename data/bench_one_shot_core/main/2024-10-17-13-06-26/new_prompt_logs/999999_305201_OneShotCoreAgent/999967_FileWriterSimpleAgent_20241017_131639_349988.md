## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.
2. We'll add a loop in the run method of MainGameScene to allow for multiple battles.
3. We'll ensure that the game can be quit from the MainGameScene if needed.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 059dafdd-eb48-4648-b65f-e0728d3e7576
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
            battle_result = self.battle_loop()
            
            if battle_result == "quit":
                self._quit_whole_game()
                return
            
            play_again = self.ask_play_again()
            if not play_again:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            
            # Reset creatures for the next battle
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

                return "quit"

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                return "battle_end"

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices.append(quit_button)
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        
        if choice == quit_button:
            return "quit"
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")

    def ask_play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        main_menu_button = Button("Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, main_menu_button])
        return choice == play_again_button
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a main loop in the `run` method that allows for multiple battles.
2. Introducing a "Quit" option in the player's choices during battle.
3. Adding an `ask_play_again` method to give the player the option to play another battle or return to the main menu.
4. Properly transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game based on the player's choices.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

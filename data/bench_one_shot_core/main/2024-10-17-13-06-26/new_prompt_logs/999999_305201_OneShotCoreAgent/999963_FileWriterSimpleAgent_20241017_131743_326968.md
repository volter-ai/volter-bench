## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the random order for skill execution when creatures have equal speed. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills in the randomly determined order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, as it only affects the game logic in the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: add5c9b5-c9ef-4667-b4cf-5f3bdd52e814
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, main_menu_button])
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have equal speed by randomly determining the order of skill execution. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the random decision for creatures with the same speed during the resolution phase. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. In the `MainGameScene` class, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed.
2. We'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
3. We'll keep the existing logic for when one creature is faster than the other.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as it only affects the game logic in the scene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            return "player_win"
        return None
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed. When the speeds are equal, it randomly chooses which creature goes first and informs the player of this decision. The rest of the battle logic remains the same, ensuring that the implementation aligns with the described architecture and meets the specified requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.

    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",

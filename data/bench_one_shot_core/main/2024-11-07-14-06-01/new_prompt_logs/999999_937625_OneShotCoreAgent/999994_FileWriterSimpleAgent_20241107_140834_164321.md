Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes:

1. Display the opponent's skills explicitly in the `__str__` method of the MainGameScene.
2. Add a method to reset the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class. Here's the updated file:

# Excerpt ID: b0535186-2aed-4537-b198-04433845c318
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

Opponent's skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if quit_button == choice:
                self._quit_whole_game()

            if use_skill_button == choice:
                skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
                skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
                self.apply_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            # Opponent turn
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_creature.skills[0]  # Simple AI: always use the first skill
            self.apply_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def apply_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The opponent's skills are now explicitly displayed in the `__str__` method, which is called when showing the scene to the player.
2. A new `reset_creatures_state` method has been added, which is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum values.

These modifications ensure that the implementation fully meets the specified requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the resolution phase in the MainGameScene where equal speed creatures are not handled correctly.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the solution:

   - Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
   - Implement the skill execution based on the determined order.

This solution aligns with the architecture document and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d11cb1a0-c25b-4da3-8503-82cc389708c9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            creatures = [(self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, k=2)
        
        self._execute_skill(first[0], second[0], first[1])
        if second[0].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second[0], first[0], second[1])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended! What would you like to do?")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case of equal speed creatures. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.sample()` to randomly decide which creature goes first. This implementation now aligns with the architecture document's specification.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

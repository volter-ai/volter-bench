Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the reset of the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method to the MainGameScene that resets the state of both the player's and opponent's creatures.
2. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The reset will restore the creatures' HP to their max HP.

Since we can't add methods to the models (as they must be pure data schemas), we'll implement this logic within the MainGameScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 490f72cf-16a1-45d1-8858-86342c7adacd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds the `_reset_creatures_state` method to the MainGameScene. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that all creatures (both the player's and the opponent's) have their HP reset to their maximum value.

This solution adheres to the architecture guidelines by:
1. Keeping the models as pure data schemas without methods.
2. Implementing the reset logic within the scene, which is responsible for game logic.
3. Resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, as required by the architecture documentation.

This change should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing while maintaining the integrity of the game's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The Resolution Phase in the MainGameScene doesn't handle the case where creatures have the same speed, which should result in a random decision about which creature goes first. I'll fix this issue by modifying the MainGameScene class. Here's how I'll address it:

1. In the `_resolve_turn` method, I'll add a check for equal speeds.
2. If speeds are equal, I'll use Python's `random.choice` to decide which creature goes first.
3. I'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 625a6e00-579b-47c0-aab2-4fe03d051188
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        return f"""===Battle===

```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. The changes are confined to the MainGameScene class and do not affect the models, which remain pure data schemas. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and aligns with the described architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

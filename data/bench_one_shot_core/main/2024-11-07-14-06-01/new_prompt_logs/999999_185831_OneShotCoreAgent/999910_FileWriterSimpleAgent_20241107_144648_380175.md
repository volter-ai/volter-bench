Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to use a while loop that continues until the battle is over.
3. We'll add a `battle_ended` flag to control the main loop.
4. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: d18cfbe9-9c93-428f-ad84-64bc69ff13c6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS

{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.check_battle_end()

        self.reset_creatures()
        self.return_to_main_menu()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. The main loop continues until `battle_ended` is set to True, which happens when either the player's creature or the opponent's creature is defeated. After resetting the creatures' HP, the scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene.

This solution adheres to the engine's architecture and capabilities, and it doesn't modify any models. It should resolve both issues mentioned in the QA/testing output.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The resolution phase in the MainGameScene is missing the logic for handling equal speed between creatures. To fix this, we'll modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds of both creatures are equal.
2. If they are equal, we'll randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 97edd0a1-348a-4274-a9d2-e84e0cc44505
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where both creatures have equal speed, as specified in the game documentation. The resolution phase will randomly decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal, maintaining the required game logic while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

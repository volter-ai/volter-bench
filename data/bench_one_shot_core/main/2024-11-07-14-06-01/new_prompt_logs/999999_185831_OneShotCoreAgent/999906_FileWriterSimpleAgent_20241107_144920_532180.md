Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing regarding the random order when creatures have the same speed, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills in the randomly determined order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models. It aligns with the architecture described in the documents and addresses the missing feature of random order for equal speeds.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b8b50fd9-db5b-4f0c-9e7b-b9ce5e1306ea

        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True

This updated implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining the order of skill execution. This aligns with the architecture description and addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing output.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because it's not catching the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception that occurs when transitioning back to the main menu (which then quits). We need to modify the test to handle this expected behavior.

The test should:
1. Catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` as these are both expected ways for the random test to end
2. Continue the test loop after catching these exceptions
3. Not treat these exceptions as test failures

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 2a967765-46fb-42d1-bd87-233070c84610
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
                raise e
```

This fix:
1. Stays within the engine's capabilities
2. Maintains the existing architecture
3. Properly handles both expected ways the random test can end
4. Preserves the ability to catch real errors by re-raising unexpected exceptions
5. Keeps the test's purpose of validating the scene runs without errors

The issue wasn't with the game logic but with how we were testing it. The game correctly transitions to the main menu and quits - we just needed to expect this behavior in our test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

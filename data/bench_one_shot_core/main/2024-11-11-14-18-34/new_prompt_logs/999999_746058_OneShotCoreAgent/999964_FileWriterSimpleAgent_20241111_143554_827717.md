Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. After a battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to allow the player to play again
2. This maintains the game loop and follows the engine's scene transition requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 930f1b2f-eaa3-4997-949a-7e7ce1194c76
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            # Execute skills
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu after battle
                return

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(*second)
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu after battle
                    return

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        p1, c1, _ = action1
        p2, c2, _ = action2
        
        if c1.speed > c2.speed:
            return action1, action2
        elif c2.speed > c1.speed:
            return action2, action1
        else:
            return (action1, action2) if random.random() < 0.5 else (action2, action1)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
        defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        
        # Apply damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
            f"Dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. When `_check_battle_end()` returns True, we now call `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` before returning
2. This ensures the scene properly transitions rather than just ending
3. The transition returns the player to the main menu where they can choose to play again or quit
4. This maintains proper scene flow according to the engine's requirements

The rest of the implementation remains the same since the issue was specifically with scene transition handling in the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The test is failing because the MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene when the game ends, but the test isn't handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the main menu's quit button is selected in random mode.

Solution Plan:
- Modify test_main_game_scene.py to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception
- This matches how test_whole_game.py handles it
- No changes needed to models or scene logic
- Stays within engine capabilities by properly handling the expected exception

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 11df3eba-64f1-41eb-980c-062e5ae75736
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully via main menu in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added descriptive print message for when the quit occurs

This matches the engine's expected behavior where:
- Scenes can transition to other scenes
- The main menu can quit the game
- Tests should handle both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
- No changes needed to the actual game logic or models

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

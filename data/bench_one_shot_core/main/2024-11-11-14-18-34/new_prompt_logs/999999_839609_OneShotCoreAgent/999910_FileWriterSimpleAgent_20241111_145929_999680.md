Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to get choices for swapping creatures. The error message shows we're calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list of choices. This happens when all available creatures are either:
- The currently active creature
- Have 0 HP

Looking at the logs, we can see this happens after several rounds of battle where creatures have fainted. The issue is in the `get_player_action` method of MainGameScene where we don't handle the case where there are no valid swap choices.

The solution is to:
1. Only show the "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. This maintains the engine's requirement that `_wait_for_choice` must always have choices
3. This is also more logical from a game design perspective - you shouldn't see a swap option if you have no creatures to swap to

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `has_valid_swaps` helper method to check if a player has creatures available to swap to
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show the Swap button if there are valid swaps available
3. Updated `__str__` to only show the Swap option when valid swaps exist

This maintains the engine's requirements while fixing the bug in a clean way that improves the game design.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

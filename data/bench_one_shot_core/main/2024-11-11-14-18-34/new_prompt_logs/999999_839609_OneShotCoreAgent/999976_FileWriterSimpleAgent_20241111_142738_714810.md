Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that `_show_text()` is missing a required positional argument 'text'. Looking at the engine code, `_show_text` requires both a player and text argument. In the MainGameScene, we're calling it with just the text.

The fix is simple: we need to specify which player should receive the text message. In a battle scene, both the player and bot should receive game messages, so we should call `_show_text` for both participants.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: ec5ad1af-c286-467d-b99b-604a213d88df
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        battle_start_text = f"Battle Start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.bot.display_name}"
        self._show_text(self.player, battle_start_text)
        self._show_text(self.bot, battle_start_text)
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self.determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.bot, self.bot_creature, bot_skill)
            )
            
            # Execute moves
            for attacker, creature, skill in [first, second]:
                if attacker == self.player:
                    defender = self.bot
                    defender_creature = self.bot_creature
                else:
                    defender = self.player
                    defender_creature = self.player_creature
                    
                damage = skill.base_damage + creature.attack - defender_creature.defense
                defender_creature.hp -= max(1, damage)
                
                attack_text = f"{creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!"
                damage_text = f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!"
                
                # Show messages to both players
                self._show_text(self.player, attack_text)
                self._show_text(self.bot, attack_text)
                self._show_text(self.player, damage_text)
                self._show_text(self.bot, damage_text)
                
                if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                    result_text = "You lost!" if defender_creature == self.player_creature else "You won!"
                    self._show_text(self.player, result_text)
                    self._show_text(self.bot, result_text)
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

    def determine_order(self, move1, move2):
        p1_creature = move1[1]
        p2_creature = move2[1]
        
        if p1_creature.speed > p2_creature.speed:
            return move1, move2
        elif p2_creature.speed > p1_creature.speed:
            return move2, move1
        else:
            return random.choice([(move1, move2), (move2, move1)])
```

The key changes are:
1. Added the player argument to all `_show_text` calls
2. Show all game messages to both players (human and bot)
3. Made the code more consistent by using player/bot variables throughout

This maintains the engine's architecture while fixing the argument error and properly handling both participants in the battle scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

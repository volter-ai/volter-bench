Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the MainGameScene test. The test is entering an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, and when it finally hits quit, the exception isn't caught properly.

The test needs to:
1. Mock the transition_to_scene method to prevent actual scene transitions
2. Mock quit_whole_game to prevent actual game termination
3. Catch both the RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 1caf1e01-457a-4ea7-a565-54a9731da4ea
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called

                mock_transition.reset_mock()
                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:

1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added proper mocking of scene transitions to prevent infinite loops
4. Added proper cleanup of mocks between test iterations

This maintains the same testing approach but properly handles all the ways the scene can exit, preventing the infinite recursion that was causing the test to fail.

The test now properly verifies that the MainGameScene either:
- Transitions to another scene
- Quits the game
- Ends due to random mode counter reaching zero

All while staying within the engine's architecture and not modifying any of the models or core game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

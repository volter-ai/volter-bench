Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset_creatures` method to the Player model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset_creatures` method from Player model
2. Move this logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Update the scene to handle resetting creature HP directly

The fix requires modifying both the models.py and main_game_scene.py files. The models should only contain data definitions, while all logic should be in scenes.

2. Here are the corrected files:

    def _reset_creatures(self, player: Player):
        """Reset creatures to starting state"""
        for creature in player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
            if player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._reset_creatures(self.player)
                self._reset_creatures(self.bot)
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            # Bot turn  
            bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
            if bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._reset_creatures(self.player)
                self._reset_creatures(self.bot)
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            # Player choice phase
            skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            player_skill = player_creature.skills[skill_choices.index(player_choice)]

            # Bot choice phase
            bot_skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in bot_creature.skills]
            bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, bot_skill_choices)
            bot_skill = bot_creature.skills[bot_skill_choices.index(bot_choice)]

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset_creatures` method from Player model
2. Added `_reset_creatures` method to MainGameScene
3. Updated the scene to call `_reset_creatures` for both players before transitioning
4. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while properly separating data models from game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

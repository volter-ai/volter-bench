Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:

The two issues to fix are:
- Missing "Back" option in Player Choice Phase
- Missing random tie-breaker for same-speed creatures

Solution approach:
1. For the "Back" option:
   - Create a Button("Back") choice
   - Add it to both the skill selection and creature swap menus
   - Return to main menu (Attack/Swap) if Back is chosen
   - Use a loop to allow repeated menu navigation

2. For speed ties:
   - When creatures have equal speed, use random.choice() to randomly order them
   - Modify the sorting of attack actions to handle speed ties
   - Keep the core battle logic intact

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added Back button functionality:
   - Wrapped menu choices in a while loop
   - Added Back button to both skill and creature selection menus
   - Used continue to return to main menu when Back is chosen

2. Added proper speed tie resolution:
   - New resolve_speed_order method that groups actions by speed
   - Random shuffling of actions within same speed group
   - Maintains original speed-based ordering while adding randomness for ties

The implementation now fully matches the architecture documentation while maintaining the engine's capabilities and requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine's design, when `_quit_whole_game()` is called, it raises a `_QuitWholeGame` exception that should be caught and handled gracefully.

The fix is to:
- Update the test to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions
- Keep the game logic intact since it's working correctly (the battle plays out and ends properly)
- Follow the pattern shown in test_main_menu_scene.py where these exceptions are expected and handled

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: b8f7de48-a250-476d-bd0b-470da7848215
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for this complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully via _quit_whole_game. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access `_QuitWholeGame`
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added catch-all exception handler to fail the test if any unexpected exceptions occur
4. Added more descriptive print messages for debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game termination scenarios in the test. The game logic remains unchanged since it was working correctly - we just needed to properly catch the expected exception in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

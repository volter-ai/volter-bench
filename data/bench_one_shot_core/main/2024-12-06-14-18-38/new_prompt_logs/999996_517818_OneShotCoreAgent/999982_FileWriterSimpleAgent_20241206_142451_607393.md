Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Creature with stats and skills collection
- Skill with damage and type attributes 
- Player with creatures collection
- Models must be in dependency order: Skill -> Creature -> Player

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json with the skill prototypes
- creature.json with creature prototypes
- player.json with player prototypes

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene: Simple menu with Play/Quit options
- MainGameScene: Complex battle scene with phases
  - Track current phase
  - Handle skill selection
  - Calculate damage based on types/stats
  - Check win conditions
  - Reset state on exit

4. Create tests:
- test_main_menu_scene.py: Already provided
- test_main_game_scene.py: Similar structure testing random choices

Let me implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines:
1. Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
2. Models reference other models directly, not by string IDs
3. Models are in dependency order: Skill -> Creature -> Player
4. Scenes handle all game logic
5. Scene transitions use proper methods
6. Tests use random mode to verify scene behavior
7. Scene __str__ methods show all relevant information
8. Models are created using from_prototype_id
9. Bots are created with create_bot and treated same as players

The game implements the full creature battle system with:
- Turn-based combat
- Physical/Special attacks
- Type effectiveness system
- HP tracking and win conditions
- State reset on scene exit

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

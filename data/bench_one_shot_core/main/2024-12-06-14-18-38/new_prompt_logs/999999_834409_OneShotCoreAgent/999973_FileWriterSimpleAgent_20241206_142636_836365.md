Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that in MainGameScene, we're storing Button objects from choices instead of the actual Skill objects. When we try to access skill.is_physical, it fails because we only have the Button.

The fix is to:
1. Use SelectThing instead of Button for skill choices, since we need to reference the actual Skill objects
2. Access the selected skill through the .thing property of the SelectThing choice

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.phase = "player_choice"
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None
        
        # Reset creatures to full HP
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):

                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner} wins!")
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed Button to SelectThing for skill choices
2. Store the actual Skill object using choice.thing instead of storing the Button
3. No other changes needed since we now have proper Skill objects

This maintains the architecture and model guidelines while fixing the issue. The models remain pure data schemas and we're properly using the engine's SelectThing capability to reference model objects.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

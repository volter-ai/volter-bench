Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the MainGameScene test doesn't properly handle the _QuitWholeGame exception. When MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene and the random bot chooses "Quit", the test crashes instead of catching the exception.

The solution is to modify the test to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception, similar to how we handle TransitionFromScene. This matches the engine's design where scenes must either transition or quit, and tests must handle both cases.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 58edf1ab-aea0-44d3-ab2e-f1ea26df408a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
                print(f"Battle completed normally in run {i}")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game quits gracefully

This maintains the engine's architecture where:
- Scenes must explicitly transition or quit
- Tests must handle both transition and quit cases
- Random testing can properly exercise all paths through the game

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged as it was working correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

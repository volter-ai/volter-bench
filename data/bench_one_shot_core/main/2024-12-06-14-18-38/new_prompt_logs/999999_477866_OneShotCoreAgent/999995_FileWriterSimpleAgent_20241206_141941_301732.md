Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a method `reset_creatures()` to the Player model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset_creatures` method from the Player model
2. Move this logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Keep models as pure data schemas
4. Update the MainGameScene to handle creature HP reset directly

Here are the files that need to be fixed:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start of battle
        self._reset_creatures(self.player)
        self._reset_creatures(self.bot)

        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)

            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_player_turn(self, current_player: Player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        
        # Find selected skill
        for skill in creature.skills:
            if skill.display_name == choice.display_name:
                return skill

    def _reset_creatures(self, player: Player):
        """Reset all creatures to max HP"""
        for creature in player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the `reset_creatures` method from Player model
2. Added `_reset_creatures` as a scene method in MainGameScene
3. Updated the scene to use the new method
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas
5. Maintained the same functionality but in the correct architectural location

This should resolve the test failures while maintaining proper separation of concerns and following the engine's guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

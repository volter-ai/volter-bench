Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's `_execute_action` method where it tries to reference an undefined variable `player_action`. The issue is that we're trying to determine if the current action belongs to the player or bot by comparing it to `player_action`, but this variable isn't in scope.

The fix is to modify the `_execute_action` method to take an additional parameter indicating which player the action belongs to. This maintains clean architecture by:
- Keeping models as pure data schemas
- Not adding methods to models
- Using the scene to handle game logic
- Staying within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `is_player_action` parameter to `_execute_action`
2. Modified `_resolve_actions` to track which action belongs to which player
3. Removed the problematic comparison with `player_action` and replaced it with the explicit `is_player_action` flag

This maintains clean architecture while fixing the NameError issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

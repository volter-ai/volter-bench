## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Add speed handling during the Resolution Phase.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures upon leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how I'll address each issue:

1. For the 'Back' option, I'll add it to the skill selection and creature swap menus, allowing players to return to the main action selection.
2. For speed handling, I'll compare the speed of the active creatures to determine the order of actions in the Resolution Phase.
3. To reset the creature state, I'll add a method to restore all creatures' HP to their max_hp before exiting the scene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address all the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the attack and swap action selection menus.
2. Speed handling is implemented in the `resolve_actions` method, which sorts actions based on the creatures' speed before executing them.
3. The `reset_creatures_state` method is added and called in the `end_battle` method to restore all creatures' HP to their max_hp before exiting the scene.

These modifications maintain the existing model structure and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `MainGameScene` now more closely aligns with the architecture documentation and addresses the issues raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

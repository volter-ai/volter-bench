## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the `MainGameScene` to explicitly manage skills in a queue as described in the architecture. Here's how I plan to fix this:

1. Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. Modify the `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods to add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them.
3. Update the `resolution_phase` method to process skills from the queue one by one.

This approach will align the implementation with the architecture description while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 05f56d7e-5ad8-4eda-9339-fc65a23ac9a3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.opponent_creature.skills)}

Skill Queue: {', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.skill_queue)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                attacker, defender = self.player, self.opponent
                attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
            else:
                attacker, defender = self.opponent, self.player
                attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature

            self._show_text(attacker, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(defender, f"Opponent used {skill.display_name}!")

            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage

            self._show_text(attacker, f"You dealt {skill.damage} damage!")
            self._show_text(defender, f"Opponent dealt {skill.damage} damage!")

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

This updated implementation explicitly manages skills in a queue as described in the architecture. The `skill_queue` is added as an attribute to the `MainGameScene` class, and the `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods now add chosen skills to this queue. The `resolution_phase` method processes skills from the queue one by one, ensuring that the game logic aligns with the architecture description.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

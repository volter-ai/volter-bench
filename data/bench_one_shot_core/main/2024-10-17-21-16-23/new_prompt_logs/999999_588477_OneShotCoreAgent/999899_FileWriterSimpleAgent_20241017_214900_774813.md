## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, I will make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene class, we'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. We'll call this reset method at the end of the run() method in MainGameScene, just before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6cee2c8b-43a9-41c2-91ff-78dbc1130934
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
        self.reset_creatures_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, target):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.creatures[0].attack + skill.base_damage - target.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.creatures[0].sp_attack / target.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        effectiveness = self.calculate_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, target.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * effectiveness)
        
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def calculate_effectiveness(self, skill_type, target_type):
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "normal": {"fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(target_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds a new method `reset_creatures_state()` which resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset for the next battle.

This change addresses the issue raised in the QA pass while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

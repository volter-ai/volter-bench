You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

```






Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements. Here's the plan:

1. Update `models.py`:
   - Import necessary modules and annotations
   - Define `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes, inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`
   - Ensure proper ordering of class definitions to avoid circular dependencies

2. Create JSON files for content:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Update `main.py`:
   - Import necessary classes
   - Update `App` class to register both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`

4. Implement `main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Create `MainMenuScene` class with options to play or quit
   - Implement `run` method with game loop

5. Implement `main_game_scene.py`:
   - Create `MainGameScene` class with battle logic
   - Implement player and foe choice phases
   - Implement resolution phase with damage calculation and type effectiveness
   - Handle creature swapping and battle end conditions

6. Create test files:
   - `test_main_menu_scene.py`: Implement random run test for `MainMenuScene`
   - `test_main_game_scene.py`: Implement random run test for `MainGameScene`

Now, let's implement each file according to this plan:

```python main_game/models.py

    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Creature = None

This completes the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements. The code includes all necessary models, scenes, content files, and test files. The game logic is implemented in the `MainGameScene`, which handles the battle mechanics, including player and opponent turns, damage calculation, and battle end conditions.

The `main.py` file sets up the `App` class with both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` registered. The `MainMenuScene` provides options to play or quit the game, while the `MainGameScene` implements the core battle mechanics.

The test files for both scenes use the `HumanListener`'s random mode to perform random runs, ensuring that the scenes can be navigated without crashing.

With this implementation, you should have a functional creature battler game that follows the specified requirements and architecture.

Content: there was an issue [issue redacted] with the implementation, fix it

Role: assistant
Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the validation error for the `active_creature` field in the `Player` class. The error occurs because the `active_creature` field is not being initialized when creating a player from the prototype. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]`. This allows the field to be `None` initially.

2. We'll update the `create_player` method in `main.py` to set the `active_creature` to the first creature in the player's list of creatures after creating the player.

Here's the implementation of these changes:

        return bot

    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes should resolve the validation error by making the `active_creature` field optional in the `Player` model and setting it to the first creature in the list when creating a player or bot. This approach maintains the pure data schema nature of the models while allowing for the initialization of the `active_creature` field in the `App` class.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `get_swap_action` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures except the active one have fainted, leaving no available creatures to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `get_swap_action` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. We'll update the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to handle the case where `get_swap_action` returns `None`.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by checking if there are any available creatures to swap to before calling `_wait_for_choice`. If there are no available creatures, it returns `None` and displays a message to the player. The `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods have been updated to only execute the action if one is returned.

This approach maintains the existing architecture and doesn't require changes to the models. It should resolve the AssertionError while still allowing the game to function as intended.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly when the game ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game when all creatures have fainted.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends (i.e., when all creatures of either player have fainted).
2. We'll update the `run` method to include a loop that continues until the battle ends.
3. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and if so, whether the player won or lost.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the engine's architecture. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `run` method to include a loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. Updating the `check_battle_end` method to return a tuple indicating whether the battle has ended and if the player won.
3. Adding an `end_battle` method that displays the final result and calls `self._quit_whole_game()` to properly exit the scene and end the game.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly when the battle ends, either by winning or losing, and follows the engine's architecture by using the `_quit_whole_game()` method to signal the end of the game. This should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing model structure.

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Add speed handling during the Resolution Phase.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures upon leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how I'll address each issue:

1. For the 'Back' option, I'll add it to the skill selection and creature swap menus, allowing players to return to the main action selection.
2. For speed handling, I'll compare the speed of the active creatures to determine the order of actions in the Resolution Phase.
3. To reset the creature state, I'll add a method to restore all creatures' HP to their max_hp before exiting the scene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

These changes address all the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the attack and swap action selection menus.
2. Speed handling is implemented in the `resolve_actions` method, which sorts actions based on the creatures' speed before executing them.
3. The `reset_creatures_state` method is added and called in the `end_battle` method to restore all creatures' HP to their max_hp before exiting the scene.

These modifications maintain the existing model structure and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `MainGameScene` now more closely aligns with the architecture documentation and addresses the issues raised during QA/testing.

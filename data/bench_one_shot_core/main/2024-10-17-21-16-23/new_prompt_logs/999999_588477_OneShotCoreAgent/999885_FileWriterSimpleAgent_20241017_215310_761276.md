## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase of the MainGameScene. This option should allow players to return to the previous set of choices when selecting an attack or swap action. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include a 'Back' option when choosing between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.
2. We'll update the `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods to include a 'Back' option that allows returning to the main choice.
3. We'll implement a loop in the `_player_choice_phase` method to handle the 'Back' functionality.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models won't be affected by this change, as it only involves modifying the scene logic.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This implementation adds the 'Back' option to both the attack and swap choices, allowing players to return to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'. The `_player_choice_phase` method now uses a loop to handle the 'Back' functionality, ensuring that players can navigate through their choices as described in the architecture document.

These changes address the missing 'Back' option issue while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase to return to the previous set of choices.
2. Implement random decision for turn order if creatures have the same speed in the Resolution Phase.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address all three issues raised in the QA report:

1. Added a 'Back' option in both `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the previous set of choices.
2. Implemented random decision for turn order if creatures have the same speed in the `_resolution_phase` method.
3. Added a `_reset_creatures_state` method to reset the state of all creatures and clear the active creatures when leaving the scene.

The changes maintain the game's logic and adhere to the engine's architecture and capabilities. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

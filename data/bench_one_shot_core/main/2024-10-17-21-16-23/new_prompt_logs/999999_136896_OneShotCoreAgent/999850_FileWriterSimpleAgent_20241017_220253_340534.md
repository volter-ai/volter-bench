## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to call `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the `run` method of `MainGameScene` continues to loop until the battle ends.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and transitions back to the main menu, adhering to the engine's architecture and capabilities.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 60db9de6-0c8b-40fe-9d3d-5a899eb6e92a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

        new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing
        self._perform_swap(player, new_creature)
        return True
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue looping until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to set `battle_ended` to True and transition to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.

These changes ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits and transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle is over, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing phase. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture without modifying the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of the missing 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll add a 'Back' option to the attack and swap choice menus.
2. We'll implement a loop in the `_player_choice_phase` method that allows the player to go back to the main choice menu.
3. We'll ensure that the 'Back' option is available in both the attack and swap menus.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing the 'Back' option in both the attack and swap choice menus. The `_player_choice_phase` method now uses a loop to allow the player to go back to the main choice menu if they select the 'Back' option in either the attack or swap menus.

The changes maintain the current architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, with all game logic contained within the scene class. This implementation should now fully align with the described architecture, including the 'Back' option functionality in the Player Choice Phase.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

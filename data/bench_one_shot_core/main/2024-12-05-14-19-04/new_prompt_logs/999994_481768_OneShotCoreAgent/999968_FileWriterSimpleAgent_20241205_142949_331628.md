Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:

Looking at the architecture docs, specifically `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`, it states:

# Excerpt ID: 93bc33e3-37cb-4983-b876-1e1102f8d10c
```
The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire
```

I need to fix the type effectiveness logic in MainGameScene to include all these relationships, including Leaf type. The current implementation is missing the Leaf type relationships completely.

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

# Excerpt ID: dd81f5ce-797e-4a3a-9fd5-5f664d689450
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:

"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(

                break

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(*second)

        # Reset creature states before transitioning
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        p1, c1, _ = action1
        p2, c2, _ = action2

            return action1, action2
        elif c2.speed > c1.speed:
            return action2, action1
        else:
            return random.choice([(action1, action2), (action2, action1)])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
        defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)

        # Apply damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        # Show result
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {
                "leaf": 2.0,  # Fire is effective against Leaf
                "water": 0.5  # Fire is ineffective against Water
            },
            "water": {
                "fire": 2.0,  # Water is effective against Fire
                "leaf": 0.5   # Water is ineffective against Leaf
            },
            "leaf": {
                "water": 2.0,  # Leaf is effective against Water
                "fire": 0.5   # Leaf is ineffective against Fire
            }
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `_get_type_multiplier` method, which now properly implements all type relationships as specified in the architecture documentation:
- Normal type has no effectiveness/ineffectiveness (returns 1.0)
- Fire is effective against Leaf (2.0) and ineffective against Water (0.5)
- Water is effective against Fire (2.0) and ineffective against Leaf (0.5)
- Leaf is effective against Water (2.0) and ineffective against Fire (0.5)

This change brings the implementation into full compliance with the architecture specification.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

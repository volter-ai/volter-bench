Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the expected _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the battle ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught, as indicated by the error message.

Looking at other test files in the codebase, we need to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (which happens when random moves run out) and _QuitWholeGame (which happens when the game ends normally).

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 4ef72e9d-59b7-49b5-a3e3-23941c04fa44
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added try/except block to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statements to help debug which exception was caught

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected exceptions that can occur during testing. The MainGameScene itself is working correctly by raising _QuitWholeGame when the battle ends - we just needed to catch it in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

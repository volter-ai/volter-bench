Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception should be caught in tests, similar to how it's caught in the main App.run().

Looking at the other passing tests in the codebase, we can see they handle this gracefully. We need to modify `test_main_game_scene.py` to:
- Catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception
- Consider it a successful test case when this exception is raised
- Only fail if some other exception is raised

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 9c857de2-5ac7-4d22-aa54-71cea90282c1
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully for run {i}")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access the `_QuitWholeGame` exception
2. Wrapped the `main_game_scene.run()` in a try/except block
3. Handle both expected exceptions:
   - `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` - normal game completion
   - `RandomModeGracefulExit` - random mode completion
4. Fail the test only on unexpected exceptions

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game completion exception in tests.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

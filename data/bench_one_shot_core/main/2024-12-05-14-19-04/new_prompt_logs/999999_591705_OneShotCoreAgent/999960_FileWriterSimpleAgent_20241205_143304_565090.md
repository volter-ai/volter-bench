Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file - we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine architecture, this exception is expected and should be caught, as indicated by the error message.

Looking at the other test files that passed, we need to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` in our test.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ed26f49d-1a54-4f47-a1ba-bc9b6d7f55e0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

The changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access the `_QuitWholeGame` exception
2. Added a second except clause to catch `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added appropriate logging message for the graceful exit case

This fix:
- Stays within the engine's architecture by properly handling its expected exceptions
- Doesn't require changes to the models or game logic
- Maintains the test's purpose of ensuring the scene can run multiple times without crashing
- Properly handles both ways the scene can end (random mode timeout or game completion)

The MainGameScene itself is working correctly by raising `_QuitWholeGame` when the battle ends - we just needed to catch it in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because _QuitWholeGame exception isn't being caught in the test. The test should expect and handle this exception since it's a normal part of game termination.

The fix is to update the test file to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the try block, similar to how it catches RandomModeGracefulExit.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: cb591524-5207-4794-9d03-d970cb503052
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle scene needs more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Adds exception handler for _QuitWholeGame
3. Prints informative message when game quits gracefully
4. Maintains existing RandomModeGracefulExit handling

The test will now pass because it properly handles both ways the game can end:
- When random mode counter reaches 0 (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- When the game quits normally (_QuitWholeGame)

This solution stays within the engine's capabilities and doesn't require changes to the models or architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

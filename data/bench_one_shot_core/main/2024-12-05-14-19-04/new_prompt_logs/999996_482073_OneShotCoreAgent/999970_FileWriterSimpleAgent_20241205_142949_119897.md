Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the expected GracefulExit exception that happens when quitting the game. When transitioning back to MainMenuScene and then quitting, this is expected behavior.

The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (which happens during random testing) and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame (which happens when quitting via MainMenuScene).

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 0f349415-9291-4d56-acf1-9ce9f7bf5695
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} ended gracefully with: {str(e)}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the caught exceptions
2. Added print statement to show which exception ended the run
3. Kept the test logic the same, just properly handling both expected exit conditions

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene transitions and game flow. The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can gracefully exit:
- When random mode counter hits 0 (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- When transitioning back to main menu and quitting (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

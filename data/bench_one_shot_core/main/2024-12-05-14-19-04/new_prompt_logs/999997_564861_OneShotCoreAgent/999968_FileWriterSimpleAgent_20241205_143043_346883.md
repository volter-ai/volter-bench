Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because _QuitWholeGame exception isn't being caught in the test. When the battle ends, MainGameScene calls _quit_whole_game() which raises this exception. According to the engine's design, this is expected behavior and should be caught in the test alongside RandomModeGracefulExit.

The fix should:
- Catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in the test
- Keep the same model structure
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Maintain the same battle logic

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 450ec95e-b263-4608-aee6-6eaab6a6b797
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle ended naturally, ending run {i}")
            finally:
                # Reset creature HP for next iteration
                for creature in player.creatures:
                    creature.hp = creature.max_hp
                for creature in main_game_scene.bot.creatures:
                    creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added descriptive print message for battle end case
4. Maintained all other test functionality including HP reset

This ensures we properly handle both ways the scene can end:
- When random mode counter reaches 0 (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- When the battle naturally concludes (_QuitWholeGame)

The MainGameScene remains unchanged as it was correctly raising the exception - we just needed to catch it properly in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene's game loop is terminating without properly transitioning or quitting. This happens because:

1. When a player wins, we transition to MainMenuScene
2. When that MainMenuScene transitions back to MainGameScene, the creatures are still in their damaged state
3. This causes the check_battle_end() to immediately return true, breaking the loop without a proper transition

The fix should:
1. Reset creature HP when starting a new battle
2. Properly quit the game when a player wins instead of going back to menu
3. Stay within engine capabilities using _quit_whole_game()

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added HP reset in __init__ to ensure fresh battles
2. Removed transition_to_scene from handle_fainted_creature
3. Added _quit_whole_game() when battle ends
4. Properly return after _quit_whole_game() to ensure clean exit

This maintains the game's mechanics while properly ending the game when a battle concludes, staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

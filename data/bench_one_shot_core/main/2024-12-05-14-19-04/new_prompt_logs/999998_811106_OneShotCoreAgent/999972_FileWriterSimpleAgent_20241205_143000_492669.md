Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid choices available. This happens because:
- We're not checking if there are any valid creatures to swap to before offering the swap option
- The get_swap_choice method creates an empty choices list when no valid swaps exist

The fix should:
- Only show the "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
- Keep the battle mechanics intact while preventing the empty choices error
- Stay within the engine's capabilities by using the existing choice system

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return not (player_has_creatures and opponent_has_creatures)
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `has_valid_swaps` method to check if a player has creatures available to swap to
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show the Swap button if valid swaps exist
3. Updated `__str__` to only show the Swap option when valid swaps exist
4. The swap choice will now never be empty since we check before offering it

This maintains the game's mechanics while preventing the empty choices error, and stays within the engine's capabilities by using the existing choice system.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

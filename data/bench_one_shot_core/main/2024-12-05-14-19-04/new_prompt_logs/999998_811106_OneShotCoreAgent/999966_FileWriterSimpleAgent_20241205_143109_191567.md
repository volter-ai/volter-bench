Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. The test is designed to catch TransitionFromScene, but we changed the game to use _quit_whole_game() instead.

We need to:
1. Keep using _quit_whole_game() in the MainGameScene (it's the right way to end the game)
2. Update the test to handle both possible ways the scene might end:
   - Via transition (which raises TransitionFromScene)
   - Via game end (which raises _QuitWholeGame)

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 206cc1dc-bca2-4716-ba5a-c3217961460e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting scene via game end")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called

                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Kept the existing transition and random mode handlers
4. Added appropriate print statements for debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both ways the scene might end. The test will now pass whether the scene ends via transition or via game end.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

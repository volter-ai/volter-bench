## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. Currently, the scene continues running even after a player wins or loses, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After a player wins or loses, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the scene exits properly after the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1248ab63-291e-4c92-97b0-ca28c75bbf4d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self.end_battle("You lost the battle!")
                break
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self.end_battle("You won the battle!")
                break

            self.player_turn()
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.opponent_turn()

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self.use_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing)
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def opponent_turn(self):
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self.use_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def use_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_weakness_factor(skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def end_battle(self, message: str):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated version of `main_game_scene.py` includes the following changes:

1. We've added an `end_battle` method that displays the final battle message and transitions back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. In the `run` method, we now call `end_battle` when either the player or the opponent's creature's HP reaches 0.
3. The battle loop will break after calling `end_battle`, ensuring that the scene exits properly.

These changes should resolve the issue in the test. The scene will now exit as expected when the battle ends, either by transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game if the player chooses to quit during their turn. This should satisfy the test's assertion that either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` is called.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not implementing the random execution order when creatures have the same speed, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a method to determine the order of skill execution based on the creatures' speed, including a random decision when speeds are equal.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. Add a new method `determine_execution_order` to compare speeds and randomly decide the order if they're equal.
2. Modify the `run` method to use this new method for determining the order of skill execution.
3. Refactor the turn logic to accommodate this new order of execution.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 4ef7a792-4716-4043-904c-bf22110e2e3c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This updated version of `main_game_scene.py` includes the following changes:

1. We've added a `determine_execution_order` method that compares the speeds of the creatures and randomly decides the order if they're equal.
2. The `run` method now includes separate methods for `player_turn`, `opponent_turn`, and `resolution_phase`.
3. In the `resolution_phase`, we use the `determine_execution_order` method to decide which creature's skill should be executed first.
4. We've renamed `use_skill` to `execute_skill` for clarity, and it now takes a creature and a skill as parameters.
5. We check if the second creature is still alive before executing its skill in the resolution phase.

These changes implement the random execution order when creatures have the same speed, as required by the game architecture. The rest of the implementation remains largely the same, maintaining the existing functionality while addressing the specific issue raised in the QA pass.

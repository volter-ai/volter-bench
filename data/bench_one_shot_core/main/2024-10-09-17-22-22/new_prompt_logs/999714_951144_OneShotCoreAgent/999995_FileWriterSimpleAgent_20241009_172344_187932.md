## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` test is failing because the game is not properly ending or transitioning after the `MainGameScene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the main menu.

Here's the proposed solution for the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 315fcc0c-af2c-4b5d-a006-ec659d2f134f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._end_battle()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.foe_creature.hp <= 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop ends when a creature's HP reaches zero.
2. Adding an `_end_battle` method that shows the battle result and transitions back to the main menu.
3. Using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to properly exit the `MainGameScene` and return to the main menu.

These modifications should resolve both the `TestMainGameSceneRandomRun.test_main_game_scene_random_run` and `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` test failures. The scene now properly exits by transitioning to another scene, which should satisfy the engine's requirements and fix the `FixableException` that was being raised.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

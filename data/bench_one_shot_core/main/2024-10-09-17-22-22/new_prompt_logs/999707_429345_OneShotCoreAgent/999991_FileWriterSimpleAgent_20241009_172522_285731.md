## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is happening because the battle ends without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_check_battle_end` method of MainGameScene, we'll add a transition to MainMenuScene after showing the battle result.
2. We'll also add a short delay using `time.sleep()` to allow the player to see the battle result before transitioning.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 8ecb9100-4518-4c58-8cbf-8e1846118ee9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Give the player time to see the result
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Give the player time to see the result
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the main issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. The added `time.sleep(2)` gives the player a moment to see the battle result before transitioning.

The changes are minimal and maintain the existing architecture and model structure. We're still using the engine's capabilities and following the guidelines for models and scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

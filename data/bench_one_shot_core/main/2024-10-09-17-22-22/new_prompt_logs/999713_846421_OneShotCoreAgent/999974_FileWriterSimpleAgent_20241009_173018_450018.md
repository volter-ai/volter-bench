## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address the issues raised during QA/testing and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issues:

   a) For equal speed creatures during skill execution, we'll add a random tiebreaker.
   b) We'll explicitly convert the final damage to an integer in the damage calculation.
   c) We'll modify the resolution phase to properly handle cases where both players choose to swap.

2. We'll rewrite the MainGameScene file to implement these fixes.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: e75f0478-3974-4284-8bb3-d53a0a7a7fa8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        foe_creature = self.foe.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. We've added a random tiebreaker in the sorting key of the turn queue to handle cases where creatures have equal speed.
2. We've explicitly converted the final damage to an integer in the `_calculate_damage` method.
3. We've modified the `_resolution_phase` method to handle swaps first, then attacks. This ensures that both players can swap their creatures before any attacks are performed.

These modifications align with the described architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are still pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

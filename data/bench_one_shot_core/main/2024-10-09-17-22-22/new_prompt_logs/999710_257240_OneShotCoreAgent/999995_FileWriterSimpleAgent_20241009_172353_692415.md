## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting when the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. We'll update the main game loop to break when the battle ends.
3. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and transitions to another scene, addressing both test failures.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: eb5a2421-f7ab-4c04-9794-52d12ed0c7cf
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target, skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `_check_battle_end` method returns a boolean.
2. Breaking the main game loop when the battle ends.
3. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These changes should resolve both test failures:
- The MainGameScene will now exit properly when the battle ends.
- The game will transition to another scene (MainMenuScene) after the battle, avoiding the FixableException.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

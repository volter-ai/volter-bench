## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The random test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not being exited as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends (either when the player wins or loses).
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in MainGameScene continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Here's how we'll implement these changes in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 46689d4e-3dd8-4150-9742-f7df837c631d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player, creature):
        self._show_text(player, f"Choose a skill for {creature.display_name}")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, player, creature):
        self._show_text(player, f"{player.display_name} is choosing a skill...")
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, creature.skills)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} on {defender.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends in the `_check_battle_end` method.
2. Ensuring that the game loop continues until a transition occurs, which will now happen when the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve both the issue of the MainGameScene not exiting properly and the random test failure. The scene will now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the game to continue or end as expected.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Implementing random decision for equal speeds:
We'll modify the resolution_phase method in MainGameScene to use random.choice when the speeds are equal.

b) Explicitly converting final damage to an integer:
We'll update the execute_skill method to ensure the final damage is converted to an integer using the int() function.

c) Resetting the state of player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene:
We'll add a reset_creatures method to the MainGameScene class and call it before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: ac922908-947d-4fd2-ad69-4db20c1027cd

        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all three issues raised in the QA report:

1. The random decision for equal speeds is now implemented in the resolution_phase method.
2. The final damage is explicitly converted to an integer in the execute_skill method.
3. The state of the player's creatures (and the opponent's creatures) is reset using the new reset_creatures method, which is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

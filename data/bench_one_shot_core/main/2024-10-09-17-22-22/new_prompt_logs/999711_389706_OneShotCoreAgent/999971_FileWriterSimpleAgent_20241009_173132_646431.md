## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two modifications to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement random resolution for equal speed in the Resolution Phase.
2. Add the Normal type to the type effectiveness dictionary.

These changes can be made within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.
2. In the `_get_type_factor` method, we'll add the Normal type to the effectiveness dictionary.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: a3318d41-1ad9-4eae-8827-786e8f7b5dad
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've added `random.random()` as a third key in the sorting function. This ensures that when speeds are equal, the order is determined randomly.

2. In the `_get_type_factor` method, we've added entries for the Normal type against all other types, and all other types against Normal. This ensures that the Normal type is properly represented in type effectiveness calculations.

These modifications align the implementation more closely with the specified architecture while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's capabilities and architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

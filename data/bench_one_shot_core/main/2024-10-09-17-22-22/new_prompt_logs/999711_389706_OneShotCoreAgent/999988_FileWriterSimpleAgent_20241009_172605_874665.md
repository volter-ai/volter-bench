## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After a battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of just ending the scene.
2. We'll add a short delay after showing the battle result before transitioning, to ensure the player can see the result.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 766705c9-f99d-4329-b950-f67b2c38c99a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while True:
            if self._battle_round():
                time.sleep(2)  # Short delay to show the battle result
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
        return self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        if self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):
            return True
        if self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill):
            return True
        return False

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):

            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} and deals {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")
        
        if defender.hp == 0:
            winner = self.player if defender == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire":
            if defender_type == "leaf":
                return 2
            elif defender_type == "water":
                return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water":
            if defender_type == "fire":
                return 2
            elif defender_type == "leaf":
                return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender_type == "water":
                return 2
            elif defender_type == "fire":
                return 0.5
        return 1
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that:

1. The MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.
2. There's a short delay (2 seconds) before transitioning, allowing the player to see the battle result.
3. The scene no longer terminates without calling `transition_to_scene` or `quit_whole_game`.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and model structure while addressing the specific issues raised in the QA/testing phase. The changes are confined to the MainGameScene, which is responsible for the battle logic and flow.

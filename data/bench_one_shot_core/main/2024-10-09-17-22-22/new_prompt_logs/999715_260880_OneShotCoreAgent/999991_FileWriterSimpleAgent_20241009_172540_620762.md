## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle end condition is not properly handled.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended and return to the main menu.
3. We'll ensure that the `run` method continues to loop until the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 36ec7bb5-7004-4307-a58b-145f175a9216
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            if self.player_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            if self.opponent_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s turn!")
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        return self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = max(1, int(weakness_factor * raw_damage))  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")
        return defender.hp == 0

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue looping until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating the `check_battle_end` method to set `battle_ended` to True when the battle is over.
4. Adding a `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` call at the end of the `run` method to return to the main menu after the battle ends.
5. Ensuring that at least 1 damage is dealt in each attack to prevent infinite loops.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game properly transitions between scenes and exits the battle when it's over.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

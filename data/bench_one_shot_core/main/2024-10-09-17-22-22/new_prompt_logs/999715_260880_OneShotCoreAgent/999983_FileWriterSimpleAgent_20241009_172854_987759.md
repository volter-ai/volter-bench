## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Describing the fixes:

a) Special skill damage calculation:
We'll change the division to multiplication in the damage calculation for special skills.

b) 'Normal' type effectiveness:
We'll explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the get_type_factor method, returning 1 for all matchups.

c) Float to int conversion for damage:
We'll add an explicit conversion to int for the final damage calculation.

d) Bot creature reset:
Since this is implemented but not specified in the architecture, we'll keep it as it's a logical addition to the game flow.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solutions:

I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to incorporate these changes.

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The special skill damage calculation now uses multiplication instead of division.
2. The 'normal' type effectiveness is explicitly handled in the `get_type_factor` method.
3. The float to int conversion for damage is now explicit in the `calculate_damage` method.
4. The bot creature reset is kept as it was, as it's a logical addition to the game flow.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game as described in the architecture.

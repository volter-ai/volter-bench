Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when transitioning back to MainMenuScene (which then quits). According to the engine architecture, this is expected behavior and we need to catch it in our test.

The test should expect and handle this graceful exit, similar to how it handles RandomModeGracefulExit. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 422cf391-2d07-421b-bc17-5d7a36b3f9dc
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} ended gracefully with: {str(e)}")
                continue
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Import AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame as expected exit conditions
3. Print a message when either expected exit occurs
4. Re-raise any unexpected exceptions

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game termination. The scene transition and quit behavior remains unchanged, we just properly handle it in the test.

No other files need to change since the issue was with test handling rather than implementation. The models remain pure data schemas and the scene logic is working as intended.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to get a bot's action in MainGameScene when there are no available creatures to swap to. This happens because we're trying to show swap choices even when there are no valid creatures to swap to.

The fix should:
- Check if there are available creatures before offering the "Swap" choice
- Only show "Attack" if there are no creatures to swap to
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities by using the existing choice system

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method where we now:
1. Check for available creatures before building the choice list
2. Only include "Swap" button if there are creatures to swap to
3. Always include "Attack" if the creature has skills
4. This ensures we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player or bot

The rest of the implementation remains the same, maintaining the pure data schema models and working within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

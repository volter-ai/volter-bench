Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me describe the fix:

1. The issue is that creature HP doesn't reset when leaving MainGameScene, which means subsequent battles start with damaged creatures
2. According to the docs, we need to reset creature state when transitioning out
3. The solution is to:
   - Store initial max_hp as the reset point
   - Reset HP to max_hp before transitioning to MainMenuScene
   - Do this for both player and opponent creatures
4. This should be done in MainGameScene since scenes handle game logic
5. We'll do this just before the scene transition in check_battle_end()

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

            self.reset_creature_states()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creature_states()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added reset_creature_states() method to handle resetting creature HP
2. Called reset_creature_states() before transitioning in check_battle_end()
3. This ensures creatures are restored to full HP before the next battle
4. Keeps models as pure data schemas since all logic is in the scene
5. Follows the engine's patterns by handling state changes in scene logic

This should resolve the issue while maintaining proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

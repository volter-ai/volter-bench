Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when transitioning back to MainMenuScene (which then quits the game).

The test should:
- Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
- Consider both exceptions as valid test completion paths
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Not modify the models or core game logic

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: acb4587c-82bf-4ddd-a877-c8bdb8ee1de3
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully via main menu quit. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all exception handler to fail the test if any unexpected exceptions occur
4. Added more descriptive print messages for debugging

This maintains the existing architecture while properly handling the expected game flow where completing a battle returns to the main menu which can then quit the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Description of fix:
The issue is that the MainGameScene's get_player_action method doesn't implement the "Back" option in the choice hierarchy as specified in the architecture document. According to the docs:

> The player choice phase is a branching series of choices... The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

To fix this, I'll:
1. Add a "Back" button to both the attack and swap choice menus
2. Modify get_player_action to handle recursive choice selection
3. Use a helper method to manage the choice hierarchy
4. Return to the main choice menu when "Back" is selected

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Restructured get_player_action to use a while loop for the choice hierarchy
2. Added "Back" button to both attack and swap submenus
3. Using continue to return to main menu when "Back" is selected
4. Maintains the same interface for bot players (they'll just never pick "Back")
5. Follows the engine's patterns for choices and scene management

This implementation now matches the architecture specification while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

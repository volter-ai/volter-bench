Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs when transitioning back to MainMenuScene (which then quits). 

In the test, we need to:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
2. Consider both exceptions as valid test outcomes
3. Follow the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py which handles these cases

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: fbd8c8f8-d350-4389-a23d-bdb5b86a858f
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully via MainMenuScene transition. Ending run {i}")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene ended without expected graceful exit")
```

The changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added else clause to fail if neither expected exception occurs
4. Kept the scene implementation intact since it's working correctly
5. Follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py for handling graceful exits

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene's behavior, including its transition back to MainMenuScene and subsequent quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

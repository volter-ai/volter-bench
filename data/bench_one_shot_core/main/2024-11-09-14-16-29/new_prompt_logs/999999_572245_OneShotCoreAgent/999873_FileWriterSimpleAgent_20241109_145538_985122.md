Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Description of fix:
The issue is in MainGameScene's resolve_turn method where we're not properly handling equal speed creatures. Currently, when speeds are equal, the player always goes first. According to the documentation:

"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The fix will:
- Add a speed comparison check in resolve_turn
- Use random.choice to randomly select which attacker goes first when speeds are equal
- Keep all other battle logic intact
- Stay within engine capabilities by using Python's built-in random module
- Not modify any models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key change is in the resolve_turn method where we now properly handle equal speeds by randomly selecting the first attacker. This brings the implementation in line with the documentation while maintaining all other functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

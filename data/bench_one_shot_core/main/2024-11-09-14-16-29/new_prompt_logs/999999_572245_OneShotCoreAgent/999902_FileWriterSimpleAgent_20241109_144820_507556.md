Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since active_creature is a required field in the model but shouldn't be in the initial JSON (as it's set during gameplay), we need to make it Optional in the model.

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Modify the Player model in models.py to make active_creature an Optional field using Optional[Creature]
2. Keep the field in the model but allow it to be None initially
3. The actual active creature will be set during gameplay in the MainGameScene

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: c775fdd7-fb1c-4f1d-b7bd-a1117e0778a9
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change:
1. Follows the pure data schema requirement
2. Maintains proper inheritance from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
3. Makes active_creature optional with a None default value
4. Allows the MainGameScene to set active_creature during gameplay
5. Keeps the model as a pure data schema without methods

The validation error should now be resolved since active_creature is allowed to be None when the Player is first created from the JSON data.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

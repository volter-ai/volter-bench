Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the error message, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at the test_main_menu_scene.py that passed, it's handling this by catching both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `GracefulExit` (which `_QuitWholeGame` inherits from).

I'll fix the test_main_game_scene.py file to properly handle both expected exit conditions:

# Excerpt ID: 45afe1cd-d96a-44ad-8911-b879e17457f5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except GracefulExit:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for GracefulExit
2. Added exception handler for GracefulExit
3. Added print statement to show when game ends gracefully

This fix:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Doesn't modify any models
- Properly handles both expected exit conditions (random mode timeout and game completion)
- Maintains test coverage of the battle scene
- Follows the pattern used in the working test_main_menu_scene.py

The test will now pass since it properly catches both ways the scene can end:
1. When random mode counter reaches 0 (RandomModeGracefulExit)
2. When the battle naturally concludes (GracefulExit via _QuitWholeGame)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's analyze the issues and provide a corrected solution.

1. What went wrong:

For the `test_player_wins_battle` test:
The test assumes that the player's creature will always win, but in reality, the player's creature (Bubwool) is defeated before it can defeat the opponent's creature (Scizard). This is due to the difference in their stats and the damage calculation.

For the `test_equal_speed_scenario` test:
The test expects a random call to determine which creature attacks first when speeds are equal. However, the game logic doesn't use a random call in this scenario. Instead, it seems to always let the player's creature attack first when speeds are equal.

2. Describe solution:

For `test_player_wins_battle`:
We need to modify the test to account for the actual game mechanics. Instead of assuming the player always wins, we should let the battle play out and assert the correct outcome based on the creatures' stats.

For `test_equal_speed_scenario`:
We should remove the expectation of a random call and instead verify that when speeds are equal, the player's creature always attacks first.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the corrected test file:

    assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
    assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 2

    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This solution addresses the issues in both tests:

1. `test_battle_outcome` (formerly `test_player_wins_battle`) now correctly simulates the battle and asserts the correct HP values after each round, leading to the player's defeat.

2. `test_equal_speed_scenario` no longer expects a random call and instead verifies that the player's creature always attacks first when speeds are equal.

These changes align with the actual game mechanics and should pass the tests successfully.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Fix the damage calculation for non-physical skills in the `_execute_skill` method of the `MainGameScene` class.
2. Explicitly reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_execute_skill` method, we'll adjust the calculation for non-physical skills to match the description in the game design document. The correct formula is:
# Excerpt ID: a7766ba9-f31f-4024-821e-76905f95df15
   ```
   [raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
   ```

2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' state (specifically their HP) to the initial values when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

        self.player_creature.hp = self.initial_player_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.initial_opponent_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA report:

1. The damage calculation for non-physical skills has been corrected in the `_execute_skill` method.
2. A new `_reset_creatures_state` method has been added, which is called before transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`. This method resets the HP of both the player's and opponent's creatures to their initial values.

These modifications ensure that the damage calculation is accurate and that the creatures' states are properly reset between battles, maintaining the integrity of the game state across multiple play sessions.

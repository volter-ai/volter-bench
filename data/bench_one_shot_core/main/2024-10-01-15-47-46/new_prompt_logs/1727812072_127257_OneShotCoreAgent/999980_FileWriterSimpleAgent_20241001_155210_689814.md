Content: I apologize for the oversight. Let's analyze the error and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The error occurs during the import process:

# Excerpt ID: bda964fa-1413-40b2-93ab-f521df17d809
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Player' from 'mini_game_engine.engine.lib' ([REDACT]/volter-monorepo/packages/mge2/mini_game_engine/engine/lib.py)
```

This error suggests that the `Player` class is not defined in the `mini_game_engine.engine.lib` module. The error is caused by a misunderstanding of the project structure. The `Player` class is actually defined in the `main_game/models.py` file, not in the engine library.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to correct the imports in the test file. We should import `Player` from `main_game.models` instead of `mini_game_engine.engine.lib`. We also need to import `AbstractPlayer` from the engine lib, as it's the base class for `Player`.

The expected gameplay trace doesn't change; we're just fixing the imports to match the actual project structure.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the corrected test file:

```

This solution corrects the imports and should resolve the ImportError. The rest of the test logic remains unchanged, as the error was solely due to incorrect imports.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the following problems:

1. The test is failing because the RandomModeGracefulExit exception is being raised, which is expected behavior but not properly handled in the test.
2. The test is running indefinitely, causing the random mode counter to reach zero and raise the exception.

To solve these issues, we will:

1. Modify the test_main_game_scene function to catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception and consider it a successful test completion.
2. Limit the number of iterations in the test to prevent it from running indefinitely.

Here's the proposed solution for the main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py file:

# Excerpt ID: c89e87f9-3782-4389-9cc7-e9018fda4074
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 50  # Limit the number of random choices
    
    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    
    try:
        scene.run()
    except RandomModeGracefulExit:
        # This exception is expected when the random mode counter reaches zero
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")

    # If we reach this point without any exceptions, the test is considered successful
    assert True
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Catching the RandomModeGracefulExit exception and considering it a successful test completion.
2. Setting a limit (50) on the number of random choices to prevent the test from running indefinitely.
3. Failing the test only if an unexpected exception occurs.

These changes should allow the test to run successfully while still exercising the game logic sufficiently. The test will now complete either when the battle ends naturally or when the random mode counter reaches zero, whichever comes first.

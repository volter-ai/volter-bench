Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Handle the 'normal' type correctly in damage calculations.
2. Use float division for special skill damage calculations to avoid integer division issues.
3. Add explicit checks to ensure damage does not go below zero.
4. Expand the reset of creature states to include all relevant attributes.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Update the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method to explicitly handle the 'normal' type.
2. Use float division in the special skill damage calculation in the `_execute_skill` method.
3. Add a `max(0, ...)` check when calculating the final damage in the `_execute_skill` method.
4. Expand the `_reset_creatures_state` method to reset all relevant attributes of the creatures.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `_calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'normal' type, returning 1.0 for all matchups.
2. Float division is used in the special skill damage calculation in the `_execute_skill` method to avoid integer division issues.
3. An explicit `max(0, ...)` check is added when calculating the final damage in the `_execute_skill` method to ensure damage is never negative.
4. The reset of creature states has been expanded to include all relevant attributes (hp, max_hp, attack, defense, sp_attack, sp_defense, speed) through the new `_get_creature_state` and `_set_creature_state` methods.

These modifications ensure that the battle mechanics are working as intended, with correct damage calculations for all types (including 'normal'), proper floating-point arithmetic for special skills, non-negative damage, and complete reset of creature states between battles. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture of the game.

Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

Play-through 1: Player wins due to type advantage
Setup: Player has Bubwool (water-type), Opponent has Scizard (fire-type)
1. Player chooses "Lick" skill
2. Opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
3. Bubwool goes first due to higher speed
4. Lick deals super-effective damage
5. Scizard uses Tackle
6. Player chooses "Lick" skill
7. Opponent chooses "Fireball" skill
8. Bubwool uses Lick, defeating Scizard
9. Battle ends, player wins

Play-through 2: Opponent wins due to equal speed and random choice
Setup: Modify Bubwool's speed to be equal to Scizard's
1. Player chooses "Tackle" skill
2. Opponent chooses "Fireball" skill
3. Random choice determines Scizard goes first
4. Scizard uses Fireball
5. Bubwool uses Tackle
6. Player chooses "Lick" skill
7. Opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
8. Random choice determines Scizard goes first again
9. Scizard uses Tackle, defeating Bubwool
10. Battle ends, opponent wins

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

```

This test file includes the original random test and two new test methods that simulate the described play-throughs. Each test method creates a scene, runs it with the ThreadedSceneRunner, and checks the game state at various points to ensure the battle progresses as expected.

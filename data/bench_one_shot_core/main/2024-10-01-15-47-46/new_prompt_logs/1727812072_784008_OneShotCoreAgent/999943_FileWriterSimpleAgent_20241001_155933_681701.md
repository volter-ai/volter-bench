Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address each point in the QA feedback and propose a solution that adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Resetting creature state: We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning out of the scene.

   b. Damage calculation for special attacks: We'll modify the damage calculation to ensure proper handling of floating-point precision.

   c. Speed tie handling: We'll implement a random tie-breaker when creatures have the same speed.

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to incorporate these changes.

Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        else:
            return random.choice([True, False])
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. We've added a `_reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max_hp before transitioning out of the scene.

2. In the `_execute_skill` method, we've modified the damage calculation for special attacks to round the result to two decimal places, ensuring better floating-point precision.

3. We've implemented a `_resolve_speed_tie` method that randomly chooses which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.

4. We've also ensured that the minimum damage dealt is 1, preventing any possibility of healing through negative damage.

These changes maintain the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the issues raised in the QA feedback.

Content: Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I understand the issues now and will address them according to the architecture and engine capabilities. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Remove the rounding of raw damage for non-physical skills, keeping it as a float.
2. Remove the implementation of minimum damage of 1.
3. Remove the display of damage dealt and current HP during the battle.

These changes will bring the implementation in line with the architecture specifications. Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these corrections:

# Excerpt ID: e9c113a1-0cd6-4d3f-86a7-4af0ca943fb1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name}\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name}\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self._resolve_speed_tie(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature):
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _resolve_speed_tie(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature) -> bool:
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return True
        elif creature1.speed < creature2.speed:
            return False
        else:
            return random.choice([True, False])
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. Removed rounding of raw damage for non-physical skills.
2. Removed the implementation of minimum damage of 1.
3. Removed the display of damage dealt and current HP during the battle.

The implementation now adheres more closely to the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The core game logic remains intact, but the display of information during the battle has been reduced to only show which creature used which skill, without revealing specific damage numbers or current HP.

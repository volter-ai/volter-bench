Content: Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I understand the issues now and will address them according to the architecture and engine capabilities. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Handle cases where both creatures have 0 HP by considering it a draw.
2. Ensure proper resetting of creature states when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.
3. Address potential floating-point precision issues in damage calculations by using integer arithmetic where possible.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):

        else:
            # Use integer division to avoid floating-point precision issues
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack * skill.base_damage) // defender_creature.sp_defense

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle ended in a draw!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _resolve_speed_tie(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature) -> bool:
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return True
        elif creature1.speed < creature2.speed:
            return False
        else:
            return random.choice([True, False])
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. We've added a check for the case where both creatures have 0 HP in the `_check_battle_end` method, considering it a draw.
2. The `_reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, ensuring that creature states are properly reset.
3. To address potential floating-point precision issues, we've modified the damage calculation for non-physical skills to use integer division.

These modifications maintain the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the potential issues and edge cases mentioned in the QA feedback. The core game logic remains intact, and we've ensured that the state is properly managed throughout the battle and when transitioning between scenes.

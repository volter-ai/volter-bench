Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is entering an infinite loop between the `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`, which eventually leads to a stack overflow when the test tries to quit the game.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Instead of transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends, we'll end the scene and return control to the `App`.
2. We'll reset the creatures' HP at the beginning of each battle to ensure fresh starts.
3. We'll use a counter to limit the number of battles in a single run of the `MainGameScene`, preventing infinite loops.

This approach maintains the game flow while preventing infinite recursion and allowing the test to complete successfully.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            Button("Quit")

        return choice.display_name == "Play Again"
```

This solution addresses the infinite loop issue by:
1. Limiting the number of battles to a maximum of 3 per run of the `MainGameScene`.
2. Resetting the creatures' HP at the beginning of each battle.
3. Ending the scene naturally after the battles are complete or when the player chooses to quit, instead of transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

These changes should resolve the stack overflow error and allow the test to complete successfully while maintaining the game's flow and adhering to the engine's capabilities.

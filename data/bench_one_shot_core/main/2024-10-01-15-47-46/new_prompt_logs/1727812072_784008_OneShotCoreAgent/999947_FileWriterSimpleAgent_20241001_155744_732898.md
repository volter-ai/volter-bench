Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `test_main_game_scene` function in the `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the test is not handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception that is raised when the game ends. We need to catch this exception and consider it a normal part of the game flow during testing.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll wrap the `app.transition_to_scene()` call in a try-except block that catches the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. When this exception is caught, we'll consider it a successful completion of a game round and continue with the next iteration.
3. We'll also add a counter to ensure that we actually play through at least one full game before the test passes.

This approach will allow the test to run through multiple game scenarios without breaking when the game naturally ends.

Here's the rewritten `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 671de8a2-52bd-4d77-aeb4-3d981a8dac23
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    completed_games = 0
    max_attempts = 10

    for _ in range(max_attempts):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception indicates a successful game completion
            completed_games += 1
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected and should be ignored
            pass

        if completed_games > 0:
            break  # We've successfully completed at least one game

    HumanListener.random_mode = False

    assert completed_games > 0, f"Failed to complete any games in {max_attempts} attempts"
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends naturally. The test now considers this exception as a successful completion of a game round. 

The test will attempt to play up to 10 games (configurable via `max_attempts`), and it will pass if at least one game is completed successfully. This approach allows for the natural flow of the game, including transitions between scenes and the game's end, without causing the test to fail.

The assertion at the end ensures that at least one game was completed, otherwise the test will fail with a descriptive message.

This modification keeps the test within the capabilities of the engine and respects the existing architecture without needing to change any models or core game logic.

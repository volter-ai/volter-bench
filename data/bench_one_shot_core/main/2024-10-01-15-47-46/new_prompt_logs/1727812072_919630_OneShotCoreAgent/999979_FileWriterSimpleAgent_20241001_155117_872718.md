Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

For the `test_player_wins_battle` test:
The test expected a second turn for the player, but the battle ended after the first turn. This is evident from the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: b004d19a-b3b7-4fe4-b003-672997821fb5
```
Your Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Opponent's Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Your Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!'}
Opponent's Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!
You won the battle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'You lost the battle!'}
```

The battle ended after the first turn because the opponent's creature's HP was reduced to 0. The test then tried to dequeue another wait_for_choice event, but instead received a scene_transition event.

For the `test_bot_wins_battle` test:
The test expected the player's creature's HP to be 0, but it was actually 10. This suggests that the initial HP setting was not applied correctly.

These errors are caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test didn't account for the battle ending immediately when a creature's HP reaches 0, and it didn't properly set up the initial state of the creatures.

2. Solution description:

To solve these issues, we need to:

1. Modify the setup of the creatures to ensure their HP is set correctly.
2. Adjust the expected sequence of events in the tests to match the actual game logic.
3. Check the scene transition at the end of each battle instead of trying to continue the battle after it has ended.

The expected gameplay trace will change slightly. For the player wins battle test, we'll only have one turn instead of two. For the bot wins battle test, we'll ensure the initial HP is set correctly.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the modified test file:

# Excerpt ID: 2831a1bd-deb1-4580-ab1b-77e45eb4a7fa
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_button
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import RandomModeGracefulExit, HumanListener, AbstractApp

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100
    player = app.create_player("test_player")

    iterations = 0

    def count_iterations(scene_name, **kwargs):
        nonlocal iterations
        iterations += 1
        if scene_name == "MainGameScene":
            raise RandomModeGracefulExit()

    app.transition_to_scene = count_iterations

    try:
        app.run(player)
    except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
        pass

    assert iterations > 0, "The game should run at least once"

class TestMainGameScene:
    def test_player_wins_battle(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        player.display_name = "Player 1"
        bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        bot.display_name = "Player 2"

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = bot
        scene.player_creature.hp = 10
        scene.opponent_creature.hp = 3

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Turn 1: Player chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 1: Bot chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 7
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 0

        # Check scene transition
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_bot_wins_battle(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        player.display_name = "Player 1"
        bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        bot.display_name = "Player 2"

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = bot
        scene.player_creature.hp = 3
        scene.opponent_creature.hp = 10

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Turn 1: Player chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 1: Bot chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 7

        # Check scene transition
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes address the issues by:
1. Removing the expectation of a second turn in the `test_player_wins_battle` test.
2. Ensuring that the HP values are set correctly before starting the scene.
3. Checking the final state of both creatures after the battle.
4. Verifying the scene transition at the end of each battle.

These modifications should make the tests pass and accurately reflect the game logic as described in the architecture document.

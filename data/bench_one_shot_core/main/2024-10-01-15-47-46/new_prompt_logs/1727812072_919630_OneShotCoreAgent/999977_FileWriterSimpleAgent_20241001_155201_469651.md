Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

For both tests, the main issue is that the creature's HP is not being updated as expected. Let's look at the `test_player_wins_battle` test:

# Excerpt ID: 2664616a-bdb2-42ff-a27a-ea4245a842c7
```
Player: Player 1 - Bubwool (HP: 10/10)
Opponent: Player 2 - Bubwool (HP: 3/10)
Available skills:
- Tackle
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Player: Player 1 - Bubwool (HP: 10/10)\nOpponent: Player 2 - Bubwool (HP: 3/10)\nAvailable skills:\n- Tackle'}
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Tackle)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
Your Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Opponent's Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Your Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!'}
Opponent's Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!
You won the battle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'You lost the battle!'}
```

The test sets the initial HP values correctly, but after the battle, the player's creature's HP is still 10 instead of the expected 7. This suggests that the damage is not being applied to the creatures in the game logic.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes that the HP values are being updated, but the actual game logic is not modifying the HP values of the creatures.

2. Solution description:

To solve this issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to actually update the HP of the creatures when damage is dealt. We can't modify the game logic in the test, so we need to update the `MainGameScene` class itself.

The expected gameplay trace will remain the same, but the actual HP values of the creatures will be updated correctly.

3. Solution implementation:

First, let's update the `MainGameScene` class:

# Excerpt ID: 897f5ed0-d3dd-4ff7-86bb-23513ef3ab4c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from collections import deque
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, AbstractApp, Player, Button

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name} - {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name} - {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
            "Available skills:\n" + "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self._show_text(self.opponent, str(self))

            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            self.skill_queue.append((self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill))

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill))

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: "Creature") -> "Skill":
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            self._execute_skills()

    def _execute_skills(self):
        attacker, attacker_creature, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender = self.opponent
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender = self.player
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"Your {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"Opponent's {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

Now, let's update the test file:

# Excerpt ID: 167ecc39-fd48-48e6-9f0f-c7e4dbf61e9c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_button
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import RandomModeGracefulExit, HumanListener, AbstractApp

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100
    player = app.create_player("test_player")

    iterations = 0

    def count_iterations(scene_name, **kwargs):
        nonlocal iterations
        iterations += 1
        if scene_name == "MainGameScene":
            raise RandomModeGracefulExit()

    app.transition_to_scene = count_iterations

    try:
        app.run(player)
    except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
        pass

    assert iterations > 0, "The game should run at least once"

class TestMainGameScene:
    def test_player_wins_battle(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        player.display_name = "Player 1"
        bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        bot.display_name = "Player 2"

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = bot
        scene.player_creature.hp = 10
        scene.opponent_creature.hp = 3

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Turn 1: Player chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 1: Bot chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 7
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 0

        # Check scene transition
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_bot_wins_battle(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        player.display_name = "Player 1"
        bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        bot.display_name = "Player 2"

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = bot
        scene.player_creature.hp = 3
        scene.opponent_creature.hp = 10

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Turn 1: Player chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Turn 1: Bot chooses Tackle
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot)
        tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert scene.opponent_creature.hp == 7

        # Check scene transition
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes address the issues by:
1. Updating the `_execute_skills` method in `MainGameScene` to actually modify the HP of the creatures.
2. Keeping the test logic the same, as it was correct in its expectations.

These modifications should make the tests pass and accurately reflect the game logic as described in the architecture document.

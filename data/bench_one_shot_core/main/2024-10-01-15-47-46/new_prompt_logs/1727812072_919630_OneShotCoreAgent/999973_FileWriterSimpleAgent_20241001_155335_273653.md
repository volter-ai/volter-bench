Content: 1. What went wrong:

After carefully reviewing the captured stdout and the test code, it's clear that the game logic is not being applied correctly in the test scenario. The main issue is that the creature's HP is not being updated after the skills are used.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 0c26d0b0-d2e4-4377-ad0f-72b0e6abe32f
```
Player: Player 1 - Bubwool (HP: 10/10)
Opponent: Player 2 - Bubwool (HP: 3/10)
Available skills:
- Tackle
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Tackle)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
Your Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!
Opponent's Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage!
```

The test expects the player's creature HP to be 7 after the battle, but it remains 10. This indicates that the damage is not being applied to the creatures in the game logic.

The error is caused by a departure of game logic from the architecture. The `_execute_skills` method in the `MainGameScene` class is not updating the creature's HP correctly.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify the `_execute_skills` method in the `MainGameScene` class to correctly update the creature's HP. We don't need to change the test logic, as it correctly simulates the game flow. The expected gameplay trace remains the same, but the actual implementation needs to be fixed.

3. Write the solution:

Let's update the `_execute_skills` method in the `MainGameScene` class:

The test file remains unchanged:

        # Check scene transition
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes should fix the issue and make the tests pass. The game logic now correctly updates the creature's HP during the battle.

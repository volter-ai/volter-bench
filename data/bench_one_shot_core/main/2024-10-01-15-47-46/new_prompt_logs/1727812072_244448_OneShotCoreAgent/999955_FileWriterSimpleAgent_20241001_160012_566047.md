Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll focus on fixing the `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` to align with the architecture and correct the damage calculation for special skills. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. Add an explicit welcome message to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. Remove any extra implementations not specified in the architecture.
3. Correct the damage calculation for special skills in the `MainGameScene`.

I'll rewrite both the `main_menu_scene.py` and `main_game_scene.py` files to implement these fixes.

        elif choice.display_name == "Quit":
            self._quit_whole_game()

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `MainMenuScene` now has an explicit welcome message shown using `_show_text`.
2. Extra implementations not specified in the architecture have been removed (e.g., the random decision for equal speed and the time delay).
3. The damage calculation for special skills in the `MainGameScene` has been corrected to use the ratio of sp. attack to sp. defense as specified in the architecture.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is kept within the scene classes.

Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

Play-through 1: Player wins quickly
Setup: Player's Bubwool has higher speed than opponent's Scizard
1. Player chooses Tackle
2. Opponent chooses Tackle
3. Bubwool attacks first due to higher speed
4. Scizard attacks
5. Player chooses Tackle
6. Opponent chooses Tackle
7. Bubwool attacks first and defeats Scizard
8. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Play-through 2: Opponent wins with a tie in speed
Setup: Modify Bubwool's speed to be equal to Scizard's
1. Player chooses Tackle
2. Opponent chooses Tackle
3. Random determines Scizard attacks first
4. Bubwool attacks
5. Player chooses Tackle
6. Opponent chooses Tackle
7. Random determines Bubwool attacks first
8. Scizard attacks and defeats Bubwool
9. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

```

This file contains the original random runner test and two new tests based on the play-throughs described earlier. The tests simulate the game events and check the expected outcomes, including the final health of the creatures and the transition to the MainMenuScene at the end of each battle.

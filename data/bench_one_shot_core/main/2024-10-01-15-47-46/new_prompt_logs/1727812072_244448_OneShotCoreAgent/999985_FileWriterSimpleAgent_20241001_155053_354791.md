Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Treat the scene as symmetric multiplayer by handling both players' actions in a more balanced way.
2. Show victory/defeat messages only to the relevant player.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to handle both players' actions symmetrically, treating the human player and the bot opponent equally.
2. We'll update the _show_text method calls to only show relevant messages to each player.
3. We'll refactor the battle logic to be more symmetric and clear.

These changes will align the implementation more closely with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1da8a1b4-e91a-4c15-86fa-72ced0771611
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, AbstractApp
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.players = [self.player, self.opponent]
        self.creatures = [self.player.creatures[0], self.opponent.creatures[0]]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.creatures[0].display_name} (HP: {self.creatures[0].hp}/{self.creatures[0].max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.creatures[1].display_name} (HP: {self.creatures[1].hp}/{self.creatures[1].max_hp})\n"
            f"Available skills:\n" + "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.creatures[0].skills])
        )

    def run(self):
        self._reset_creatures()
        self.battle_ended = False
        while not self.battle_ended:
            self._show_battle_state()
            skills = self._choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(skills)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _show_battle_state(self):

            self._show_text(player, f"Your creature: {creature.display_name} (HP: {creature.hp}/{creature.max_hp})")
            opponent = self.players[1] if player == self.players[0] else self.players[0]
            opponent_creature = self.creatures[1] if creature == self.creatures[0] else self.creatures[0]
            self._show_text(player, f"Opponent's creature: {opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {opponent_creature.hp}/{opponent_creature.max_hp})")

    def _choice_phase(self) -> list[Skill]:
        skills = []
        for player, creature in zip(self.players, self.creatures):
            choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
            skill = next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
            skills.append(skill)
        return skills

    def _resolution_phase(self, skills: list[Skill]):
        order = list(range(2))
        if self.creatures[0].speed < self.creatures[1].speed:
            order.reverse()
        elif self.creatures[0].speed == self.creatures[1].speed:
            random.shuffle(order)

        for i in order:
            if not self.battle_ended:
                attacker, defender = self.players[i], self.players[1-i]
                attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.creatures[i], self.creatures[1-i]
                self._execute_skill(attacker, attacker_creature, skills[i], defender, defender_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        message = f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!"
        self._show_text(attacker, message)
        self._show_text(defender, message)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        for i, creature in enumerate(self.creatures):
            if creature.hp == 0:
                winner, loser = self.players[1-i], self.players[i]
                self._show_text(winner, "You won the battle!")
                self._show_text(loser, "You lost the battle!")
                self.battle_ended = True
                return True
        return False
```

This rewritten MainGameScene addresses the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The scene now treats both players symmetrically, handling their actions in a balanced way.
2. Victory and defeat messages are shown only to the relevant player.
3. The battle logic has been refactored to be more symmetric and clear.

These changes align the implementation more closely with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The scene now demonstrates treating itself as a symmetric multiplayer scene, and the messages are shown appropriately to each player.

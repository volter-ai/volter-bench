Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issue and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test `test_opponent_wins` failed because the battle ended earlier than expected. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 732379c8-e04b-4f4d-9f76-27a022a8db8c
```
Your creature: Bubwool (HP: 10/10)
Opponent's creature: Scizard (HP: 11/11)
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Your creature: Scizard (HP: 11/11)'}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Opponent's creature: Bubwool (HP: 10/10)"}
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Tackle)])

BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Opponent's creature: Bubwool (HP: 4/10)"}
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Tackle)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
_wait_for_choice(Opponent, [Button(Tackle)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage to Scizard!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage to Scizard!'}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Scizard used Tackle and dealt 6 damage to Bubwool!'}
Scizard used Tackle and dealt 6 damage to Bubwool!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'You won the battle!'}
You lost the battle!
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumed that the battle would last for three turns, but it ended after two turns because the player's creature (Bubwool) was defeated. The test was expecting a third turn, but instead, it received a scene transition event, causing the ValueError.

The specific difference is that the test expected three turns, but the battle ended after two turns when Bubwool's HP reached 0.

2. Solution:

To solve this issue, we need to adjust our test to account for the possibility of the battle ending earlier than expected. We should modify the test to check for the battle end condition after each turn, rather than assuming a fixed number of turns.

3. Writing the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        assert scene.creatures[1].hp > 0, "Opponent's creature should have HP remaining"
        assert scene.battle_ended, "The battle should have ended"
```

In this updated version:

1. We've removed the third turn from the `test_opponent_wins` function since the battle ends after the second turn.
2. We've moved the assertions to check the battle outcome immediately after the second turn.
3. We've kept the same structure for both tests to ensure consistency, but the `test_opponent_wins` now correctly expects the battle to end after two turns.

These changes should resolve the issue while maintaining the integrity of the test and adhering to the game's logic.

Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll focus on fixing the `MainGameScene` in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. Implement the random decision for equal speeds in the resolution phase.
2. Modify the damage calculation to convert to integer at each step as specified.
3. Explicitly handle the 'normal' type as neither effective nor ineffective against other types.

These changes will be made while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):

                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            ], 2)

        self._execute_skill(*first)
        if second[3].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(*second)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = int(attacker_creature.attack) + int(skill.base_damage) - int(defender_creature.defense)
        else:

        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all three issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The random decision for equal speeds is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method. When the speeds are equal, it randomly selects the order of skill execution.

2. The damage calculation has been modified to convert to integer at each step as specified. In the `_execute_skill` method, we now use `int()` for each component of the damage calculation.

3. The 'normal' type is now explicitly handled as neither effective nor ineffective against other types in the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method. If either the skill type or the defender type is 'normal', the weakness factor is 1.0.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is kept within the scene class.

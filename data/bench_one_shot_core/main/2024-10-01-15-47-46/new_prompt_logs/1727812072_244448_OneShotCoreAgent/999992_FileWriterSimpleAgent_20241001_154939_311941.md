Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the infinite loop that's occurring when transitioning between scenes. The main problem is that the battle doesn't end properly, causing the game to cycle between the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene indefinitely. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a flag to indicate when the battle has ended.
2. We'll modify the _check_battle_end method to set this flag when a creature's HP reaches 0.
3. In the run method, we'll break the main loop when the battle has ended.
4. We'll reset the creatures' HP at the start of each battle to ensure fresh battles.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

            return True

```

These changes should resolve the infinite loop issue while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities. The main modifications are:

1. Added a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Implemented a `_reset_creatures` method to restore HP at the start of each battle.
3. Modified the `run` method to break the loop when `battle_ended` is True.
4. Updated `_check_battle_end` to set `battle_ended` when a creature's HP reaches 0.
5. Moved the transition to MainMenuScene outside the main battle loop.

These changes ensure that each battle starts fresh, ends properly when a creature's HP reaches 0, and returns to the main menu after the battle concludes.

Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the RandomModeGracefulExit exception that's being raised in the HumanListener. The tests are failing because they're not catching this specific exception. We can fix this by updating our test files to catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll update both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception.
2. We'll import RandomModeGracefulExit from mini_game_engine.engine.lib in these test files.
3. We'll keep the HumanListener.random_mode setting, as it's still useful for randomizing choices during testing.

This solution doesn't require any changes to the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

Let's rewrite both test files with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 5b9e76eb-01fb-4b51-a6fc-747d48144191
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the random mode run is over
            pass
```

# Excerpt ID: fb88f06c-9c4e-4777-acdd-c08af683f0d8
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the random mode run is over
            pass
```

These changes should resolve the issue by properly catching the RandomModeGracefulExit exception that's raised when the random mode run is over. The tests will now complete successfully, allowing for multiple runs of the scenes in random mode without failing due to the expected exception.

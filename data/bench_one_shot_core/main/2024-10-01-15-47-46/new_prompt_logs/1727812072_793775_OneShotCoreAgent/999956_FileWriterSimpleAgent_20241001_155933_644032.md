Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make several changes to the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how we'll fix each issue:

1. Special skill damage calculation: We'll modify the _perform_attack method to use multiplication instead of division for special skills.
2. Float operations: We'll ensure that all damage calculations use float operations before converting to integers.
3. Resetting player's creatures: We'll modify the _reset_creatures method to ensure it's called correctly when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will be implemented in the main_game_scene.py file. We don't need to modify the models.py file as these changes are related to game logic, not data structure.

Here's the updated main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. The `_perform_attack` method now uses multiplication instead of division for special skills.
2. All damage calculations now use float operations before converting to integers.
3. The `_reset_creatures` method is called at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that creatures' states are reset correctly when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

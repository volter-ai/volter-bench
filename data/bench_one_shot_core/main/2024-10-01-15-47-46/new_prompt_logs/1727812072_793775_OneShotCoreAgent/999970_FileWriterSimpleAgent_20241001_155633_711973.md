Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the AttributeError related to HumanListener.RandomModeGracefulExit. The error occurs because we're trying to catch an exception that doesn't exist. Instead, we should be catching the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception, which is raised when the game is terminated gracefully.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll update both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch the correct exception: AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame.
2. We'll import AbstractApp in these test files to access the correct exception.
3. We'll keep the HumanListener.random_mode setting, as it's still useful for randomizing choices during testing.

Let's rewrite both test files with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6a20f264-5195-4b60-b99a-4bb35eb9fe84
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends gracefully
            pass
```

# Excerpt ID: c01c79a9-bc8c-4f17-a5f3-63dd0d198a7b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends gracefully
            pass
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the tests to run successfully. We're now catching the correct exception (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) that's raised when the game is terminated gracefully, which can happen in both the MainGameScene and MainMenuScene.

The changes don't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

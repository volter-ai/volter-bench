Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to update our test files to properly handle the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception. This exception is being raised when the game ends gracefully, which is expected behavior, but our tests are not catching it correctly.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll update both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception.
2. We'll import AbstractApp from mini_game_engine.engine.lib in these test files to access the correct exception.
3. We'll keep the HumanListener.random_mode setting, as it's still useful for randomizing choices during testing.

This solution doesn't require any changes to the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

Let's rewrite both test files with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7d18f4e9-9b7c-4d9f-a3d4-8f4ba42f218d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends gracefully
            break
```

# Excerpt ID: de6852e9-3449-4571-b260-f0bd9a1fdd79
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends gracefully
            break
```

These changes should resolve the issue by properly catching the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends gracefully. The tests will now complete successfully, allowing for multiple runs of the scenes in random mode until the game ends gracefully.

The changes don't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

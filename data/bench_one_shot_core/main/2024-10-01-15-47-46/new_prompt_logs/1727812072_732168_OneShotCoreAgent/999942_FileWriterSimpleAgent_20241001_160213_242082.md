Content: I understand the issue raised during QA/testing. The problem is with the calculation of non-physical skill damage, which doesn't match the specified architecture. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. I will modify the `_execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class to correctly implement the non-physical skill damage calculation as specified in the architecture.

2. The formula for non-physical skill damage will be changed to:
# Excerpt ID: c2e6f75f-427a-4898-9cc7-4030ab67f45d
   ```
   [raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
   ```

3. I will ensure that all calculations are done using floats before converting the final result to an integer.

4. The rest of the implementation will remain unchanged to maintain consistency with the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1fea4dd8-3d34-46b7-855f-46d052847b48
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return "Main Game Scene"

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures_state()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed or \
           (self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            # Corrected non-physical skill damage calculation
            raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense)) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        # Convert float to integer for final damage
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        # Explicit handling of 'Normal' type being neutral against other types
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        # Weakness-resistance factor calculations
        if (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
           (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
           (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0  # Effective: skill does double damage
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5  # Ineffective: skill does half damage
        else:
            return 1.0  # Neutral: skill does normal damage

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        # Reset the state of all creatures for both players
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file addresses the issue raised in the QA report:

1. The calculation of non-physical skill damage in the `_execute_skill` method has been corrected to match the specified architecture:
# Excerpt ID: bc8d38a7-5d6e-4560-9082-570b6092fcb0
   ```python
   raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense)) * float(skill.base_damage)
   ```

2. All calculations are done using floats before converting the final result to an integer.

3. The rest of the implementation remains unchanged to maintain consistency with the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

These changes address the QA concerns while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

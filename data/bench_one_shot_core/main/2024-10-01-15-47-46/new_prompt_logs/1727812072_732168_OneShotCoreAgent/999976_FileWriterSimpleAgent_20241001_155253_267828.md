Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests for the MainMenuScene. Here are the play-throughs we'll simulate:

Play-through 1:
1. Create a player
2. Start the MainMenuScene
3. Player chooses "Play"
4. Scene transitions to MainGameScene

Play-through 2:
1. Create a player
2. Start the MainMenuScene
3. Player chooses "Quit"
4. Game quits

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

# Excerpt ID: 673ea7a1-daaf-4bad-917f-1faae90f0fb8
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, Button
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_button
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
        try:
            scene.run()
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends
            pass

class TestMainMenuScene:
    def test_play_game(self, app, player):
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_button = find_button(choices, "Play")
        runner.make_choice(play_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"

    def test_quit_game(self, app, player):
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        runner.dequeue_quit_whole_game()
```

This file includes both the original random runner test and the new functional tests for the MainMenuScene. The new tests cover both play-throughs: choosing to play the game and choosing to quit the game.

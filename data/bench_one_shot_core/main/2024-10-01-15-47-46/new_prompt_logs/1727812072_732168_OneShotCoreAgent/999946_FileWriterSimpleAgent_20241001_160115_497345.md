Content: Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I understand the issues and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix the problems:

1. Add a method to reset the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.
2. Add explicit comments for the weakness-resistance factor calculations.
3. Clearly show the conversion from float to integer for final damage.
4. Add explicit handling of the 'Normal' type being neutral against other types.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. The models will remain as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 592dc52f-9e70-4088-bb0e-563e9de881d3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return "Main Game Scene"

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures_state()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed or \
           (self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        # Convert float to integer for final damage
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        # Explicit handling of 'Normal' type being neutral against other types
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        # Weakness-resistance factor calculations
        if (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
           (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
           (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0  # Effective: skill does double damage
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5  # Ineffective: skill does half damage
        else:
            return 1.0  # Neutral: skill does normal damage

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        # Reset the state of all creatures for both players
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file addresses all the issues mentioned in the QA report:

1. A new `_reset_creatures_state` method has been added to reset the HP of all creatures when transitioning out of the scene.
2. Explicit comments have been added for the weakness-resistance factor calculations in the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method.
3. The conversion from float to integer for final damage is now clearly shown with a comment in the `_execute_skill` method.
4. Explicit handling of the 'Normal' type being neutral against other types has been added to the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method.

These changes address the QA concerns while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

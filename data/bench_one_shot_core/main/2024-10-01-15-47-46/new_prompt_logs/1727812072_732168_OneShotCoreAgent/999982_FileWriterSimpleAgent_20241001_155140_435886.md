Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

Play-through 1: Player wins due to speed advantage
Setup: Set player's creature speed to 5 (higher than opponent's)
1. Player chooses "Tackle"
2. Opponent chooses "Tackle"
3. Player's creature attacks first, dealing damage
4. Opponent's creature attacks, dealing damage
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until opponent's creature's HP reaches 0
6. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Play-through 2: Opponent wins due to random choice when speeds are equal
Setup: Set player's creature speed to 3 (equal to opponent's)
1. Player chooses "Tackle"
2. Opponent chooses "Tackle"
3. Random choice selects opponent to go first
4. Opponent's creature attacks, dealing damage
5. Player's creature attacks, dealing damage
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until player's creature's HP reaches 0
7. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

This file includes the original random runner test and adds two new tests based on the play-throughs described earlier. The tests simulate full play-throughs of the MainGameScene, testing different scenarios and outcomes.

Content: Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I understand the issues and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix the problems:

1. Reset the player's creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.
2. Implement correct handling for creatures with the same speed.
3. Use floats for intermediate damage calculations before converting to an integer.
4. Remove the extra implementations not mentioned in the architecture (delay and additional output).

I will rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to address these issues. Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 73244f0c-f3db-48d2-a2b1-9ddc5cb2e6ed
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:

            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creature_states()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:

        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
                if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creature_states(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file addresses all the issues mentioned:

1. The `_reset_creature_states` method is called before transitioning out of the scene, resetting all creatures' HP to their max HP.
2. The `_resolution_phase` method now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly choosing which creature goes first.
3. The damage calculation in `_execute_skill` now explicitly uses floats for intermediate calculations before converting to an integer.
4. Extra implementations (delay and additional output about damage dealt) have been removed.

These changes adhere to the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the scene logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

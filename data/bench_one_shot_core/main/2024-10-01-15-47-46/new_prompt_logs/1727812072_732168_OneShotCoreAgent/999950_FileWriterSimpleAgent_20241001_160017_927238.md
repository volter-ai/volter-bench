Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these concerns, I'll focus on aligning the implementation more closely with the described architecture. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Remove the special handling for the 'Normal' type in damage calculations, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.
2. Simplify the speed tie handling to match the architecture description.
3. Remove the creature state resetting, as it wasn't mentioned in the architecture.
4. Remove the string representation and skill usage output, as they weren't explicitly mentioned in the architecture.

I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to address these issues. Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f8795e12-766f-4b87-ac1c-0f5fd7c3362d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return "Main Game Scene"

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed or \
           (self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
           (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
           (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file addresses the issues mentioned in the QA report:

1. The 'Normal' type is no longer given special treatment in damage calculations.
2. Speed ties are now handled with a simple random check, as described in the architecture.
3. Creature state resetting has been removed.
4. The detailed string representation and skill usage output have been removed.

These changes bring the implementation more in line with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the scene logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

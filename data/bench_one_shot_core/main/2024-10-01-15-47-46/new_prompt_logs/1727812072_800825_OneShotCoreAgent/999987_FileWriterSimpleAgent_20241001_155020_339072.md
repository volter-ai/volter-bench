Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

Play-through 1: Player wins
1. Set up the scene with a player and a bot opponent
2. Player chooses "Tackle"
3. Bot chooses "Tackle"
4. Resolution phase occurs
5. Player chooses "Tackle"
6. Bot chooses "Tackle"
7. Resolution phase occurs
8. Player chooses "Tackle"
9. Bot chooses "Tackle"
10. Resolution phase occurs
11. Player wins (opponent's HP reaches 0)
12. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Play-through 2: Player loses
1. Set up the scene with a player and a bot opponent
2. Modify player's creature to have 1 HP
3. Player chooses "Tackle"
4. Bot chooses "Tackle"
5. Resolution phase occurs
6. Player loses (player's HP reaches 0)
7. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Play-through 3: Player quits
1. Set up the scene with a player and a bot opponent
2. Player chooses "Quit"
3. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

    def test_player_quits(self, app, player, opponent):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = opponent
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This file contains the original random test and three new tests based on the play-throughs described earlier. Each test simulates a different scenario: the player winning, the player losing, and the player quitting the game. The tests use the ThreadedSceneRunner to control the flow of the game and make assertions about the game state and scene transitions.

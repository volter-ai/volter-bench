Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again. We'll address this by adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll show the result message.
2. Then, we'll add a choice for the player to either play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the `MainMenuScene` or quit the whole game.

This approach maintains the game loop and ensures that the scene always ends with a proper transition or game termination.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution adds the `_end_game_choice` method, which is called after the battle ends. It gives the player the option to play again or quit the game. Depending on the player's choice, it either transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` or quits the whole game. This ensures that the scene always ends with a proper transition or game termination, fixing the issue raised in the test failures.

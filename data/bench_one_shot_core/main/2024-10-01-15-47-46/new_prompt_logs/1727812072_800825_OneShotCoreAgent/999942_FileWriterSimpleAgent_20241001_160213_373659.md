Content: I understand. Let's analyze each test and provide solutions.

1. What went wrong:

For all three tests (test_player_wins_type_advantage, test_opponent_wins_higher_stats, and test_equal_speed_scenario), the main issue is that the tests are not properly handling the end of the battle. The tests are expecting more choice events after the battle has already ended and transitioned to the MainMenuScene.

Let's look at the test_player_wins_type_advantage as an example:

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 740d9c36-fe4b-499d-9c3c-fada4b4777d6
```
Player: Default Player
Creature: Bubwool (HP: 24/32)
Opponent: Basic Opponent
Creature: Scizard (HP: 16/40)

_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Lick)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Tackle), Button(Fireball)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
Bubwool used Lick!
It dealt 24 damage to Scizard!
You won the battle!
```

The test is trying to dequeue another wait_for_choice event after the battle has ended, which causes the ValueError:

# Excerpt ID: 971eccf8-e2a8-4f35-b228-5096d68dd1a3
```python
while True:
    choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
```

This is a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The battle ends as soon as one creature's HP reaches 0, and the scene transitions to the MainMenuScene. The test should check for this transition instead of expecting more choices.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify our tests to properly handle the end of the battle. Instead of using a while True loop, we should explicitly handle each turn and check for the scene transition after each turn. We'll need to:

1. Remove the while True loops.
2. Explicitly handle each turn of the battle.
3. After each turn, check if the battle has ended by trying to dequeue a scene transition event.
4. If a scene transition occurs, assert that it's to the MainMenuScene and end the test.
5. If no scene transition occurs, continue to the next turn.

This approach will allow us to test the full battle sequence without assuming an indefinite number of turns.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.opponent = opponent
        scene.player_creature.speed = 11  # Set to match opponent's speed
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        for _ in range(4):  # Maximum 4 turns
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(opponent)
            tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                break
            except ValueError:
                continue

        assert (scene.player_creature.hp <= 0 or scene.opponent_creature.hp <= 0)
```

These changes address the issues in each test:

1. Removed the while True loops and replaced them with explicit turn handling.
2. After each turn, we now check for a scene transition.
3. If a scene transition occurs, we assert that it's to the MainMenuScene and end the test.
4. If no scene transition occurs, we continue to the next turn.
5. We've limited the number of turns to a maximum of 4 for the opponent_wins and equal_speed scenarios to prevent infinite loops.

All tests now properly simulate a full play-through of the scene and end with a transition to the MainMenuScene.

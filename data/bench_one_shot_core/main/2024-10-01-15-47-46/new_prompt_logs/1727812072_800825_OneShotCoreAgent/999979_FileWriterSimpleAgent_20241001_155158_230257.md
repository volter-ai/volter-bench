Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests for the MainMenuScene. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

1. Play-through 1:
   - Setup: Create a player using app.create_player
   - Start the MainMenuScene
   - Player chooses "Play"
   - Assert that the scene transitions to MainGameScene

2. Play-through 2:
   - Setup: Create a player using app.create_player
   - Start the MainMenuScene
   - Player chooses "Quit"
   - Assert that the game quits

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

# Excerpt ID: e92d8ff3-cf20-4765-8a6f-4ce2b4059957
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_button

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.run(player)
        except HumanListener.RandomModeGracefulExit:
            pass

class TestMainMenuScene:
    def test_play_game(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_button = find_button(choices, "Play")
        runner.make_choice(play_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"

    def test_quit_game(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        runner.dequeue_quit_whole_game()
```

This file contains the original random test and two new tests for the MainMenuScene. The first test simulates a player choosing to play the game, and the second test simulates a player choosing to quit the game. Both tests use the ThreadedSceneRunner to control the flow of the game and assert the expected outcomes.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again. We'll address this by:

1. Adding a loop in the `run` method that continues until the player chooses to quit.
2. After each battle, we'll give the player a choice to play again or quit.
3. If the player chooses to play again, we'll reset the creatures and start a new battle.
4. If the player chooses to quit, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.

This approach will ensure that the scene always ends with a proper transition, adhering to the engine's capabilities and maintaining the game's flow.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        ])
        return choice.display_name == "Play Again"
```

This solution ensures that the `MainGameScene` always ends with a transition back to the `MainMenuScene`, fixing the issue raised in the test failures. The main game loop continues until the player chooses to quit, at which point it properly transitions to the main menu.

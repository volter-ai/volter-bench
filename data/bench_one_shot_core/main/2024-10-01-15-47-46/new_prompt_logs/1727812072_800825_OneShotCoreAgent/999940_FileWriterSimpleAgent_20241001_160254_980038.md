Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions for the failing tests.

1. What went wrong:

For the test_opponent_wins_higher_stats test:

The test is expecting the player's creature to be defeated, but it's not happening within the 4 turns limit. Let's look at the relevant stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 96c1bf64-498c-4417-8127-7be92e9388a6
# Excerpt ID: f75ae6fc-f4c1-4ded-8996-8cbb6371539a
```
Player: Default Player
Creature: Bubwool (HP: 8/32)
Opponent: Basic Opponent
Creature: Scizard (HP: 25/40)

_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Tackle), Button(Fireball)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
Bubwool used Tackle!
It dealt 5 damage to Scizard!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Scizard used Tackle!'}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'It dealt 8 damage to Bubwool!'}
You lost the battle!
```

The battle ends after 4 turns, but the player's creature (Bubwool) still has 8 HP left. The test is expecting the player's creature to have 0 or less HP, which is not the case.

For the test_equal_speed_scenario test:

The test is expecting either the player's creature or the opponent's creature to be defeated, but neither happens within the 4 turns limit. The relevant stdout shows:

# Excerpt ID: 96c1bf64-498c-4417-8127-7be92e9388a6
# Excerpt ID: f75ae6fc-f4c1-4ded-8996-8cbb6371539a
```
Player: Default Player
Creature: Bubwool (HP: 8/32)
Opponent: Basic Opponent
Creature: Scizard (HP: 25/40)

_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Tackle), Button(Fireball)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Tackle)
Bubwool used Tackle!
It dealt 5 damage to Scizard!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Scizard used Tackle!'}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'It dealt 8 damage to Bubwool!'}
You lost the battle!
```

Both creatures still have HP left after 4 turns.

These errors are caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that the battle will end within 4 turns, which is not guaranteed given the current stats of the creatures.

2. Describe solution:

To solve these issues, we need to modify our tests to:

1. Remove the turn limit and continue the battle until one creature is defeated.
2. After each turn, check if the battle has ended by trying to dequeue a scene transition event.
3. If a scene transition occurs, assert that it's to the MainMenuScene and end the test.
4. If no scene transition occurs, continue to the next turn.

For the test_opponent_wins_higher_stats test, we should also increase the opponent's creature's attack to ensure it wins faster.

For the test_equal_speed_scenario test, we should keep the speeds equal but reduce both creatures' HP to ensure the battle ends faster.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception indicates a successful game completion

        scene.player_creature.hp = 15  # Reduce HP to end battle faster
        scene.opponent_creature.hp = 15  # Reduce HP to end battle faster
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        while True:
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_button(choices, "Tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

                break
            except ValueError:
                continue

        assert (scene.player_creature.hp <= 0 or scene.opponent_creature.hp <= 0)
        assert (scene.player_creature.hp > 0 or scene.opponent_creature.hp > 0)
```

These changes address the issues in each test:

1. Removed the turn limit and replaced it with a while True loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. After each turn, we now check for a scene transition.
3. If a scene transition occurs, we assert that it's to the MainMenuScene and end the test.
4. For the opponent_wins test, we increased the opponent's attack to ensure it wins.
5. For the equal_speed scenario, we reduced both creatures' HP to ensure the battle ends faster.

All tests now properly simulate a full play-through of the scene and end with a transition to the MainMenuScene.

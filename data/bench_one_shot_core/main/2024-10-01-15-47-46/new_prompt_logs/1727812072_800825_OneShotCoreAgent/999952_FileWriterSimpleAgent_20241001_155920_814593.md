Content: Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose a solution that stays within the capabilities of the engine and respects the existing architecture.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Reset the state of the player's creatures: We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning out.
   
   b. Handle equal speed cases: We'll modify the resolution phase to randomly decide which creature goes first when speeds are equal.
   
   c. Fix damage calculation for special skills: We'll adjust the formula to ensure it's calculated correctly.
   
   d. Implement 'Normal' type effectiveness: We'll update the _calculate_weakness_factor method to explicitly handle the 'Normal' type.

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to implement these fixes.

Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            else:
                first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

        self._execute_skill(*first, second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(*second, first[1])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        elif skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues mentioned:

1. The `_reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, resetting all creatures' HP to their max_hp.
2. The `_resolution_phase` method now correctly handles cases where creatures have equal speed by randomly deciding which goes first.
3. The damage calculation for special skills has been adjusted to use the correct formula.
4. The `_calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'Normal' type, returning 1.0 for all matchups.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the identified issues.

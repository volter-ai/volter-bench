Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the RandomModeGracefulExit exception that's being raised in the HumanListener. This exception is intended to gracefully end the random mode testing, but it's being treated as an unexpected exception in our test. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the test_main_game_scene function to catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception specifically.
2. We'll adjust the logic to consider the RandomModeGracefulExit as a successful completion of a test iteration, rather than an error.
3. We'll ensure that the test runs for the specified number of iterations or until all random choices have been exhausted.

Here's the rewritten test file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a7362b46-aa88-43e8-844b-88c3ed0cb19e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    iterations = 10
    completed_iterations = 0

    for _ in range(iterations):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        try:
            while True:
                scene.run()
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception indicates a successful completion of the random choices
            completed_iterations += 1
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")

    assert completed_iterations > 0, "No iterations completed successfully"
    print(f"Completed {completed_iterations} out of {iterations} iterations")
```

This solution makes the following changes:

1. We import the RandomModeGracefulExit exception from the engine library.
2. In the test_main_game_scene function, we introduce a counter for completed iterations.
3. We wrap the scene.run() call in a while True loop to allow for multiple turns within a single game.
4. We catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception separately and treat it as a successful completion of an iteration.
5. We keep track of how many iterations were completed successfully.
6. After all iterations, we assert that at least one iteration was completed successfully.
7. We print out how many iterations were completed for informational purposes.

This approach allows the test to run multiple games, each potentially consisting of multiple turns, and considers the test successful if at least one game completes all its random choices without other exceptions. It also provides flexibility in case not all iterations can complete due to the limited number of random choices available.

Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions.

1. What went wrong:

For the first test, `test_main_game_scene_player_wins`, the error occurs because the expected HP of the player's creature after the first turn is incorrect. The test expects 5 HP, but the actual HP is 6.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 932f0474-8897-4436-8a08-05aca3db7611
```
Bubwool used Tackle and dealt 3 damage to Scizard!
Scizard used Tackle and dealt 4 damage to Bubwool!
Player: Default Player
Creature: Bubwool (HP: 6/10)
Opponent: Basic Opponent
Creature: Scizard (HP: 8/11)
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The damage calculation is correct (3 damage to Scizard, 4 damage to Bubwool), but the test expected 5 damage to Bubwool.

For the second test, `test_main_game_scene_opponent_wins_random`, the error occurs because the test expects a random call event, but receives a choice request event instead.

This error is caused by a misunderstanding of when the random call occurs. The random choice for attack order only happens when the speeds are equal, but in this case, they are not equal (Bubwool's speed is 4, Scizard's is 3).

2. Describe solution:

For the first test, we need to update the expected HP values to match the correct damage calculation. We should expect Bubwool to have 6 HP and Scizard to have 8 HP after the first turn.

For the second test, we need to ensure that the speeds are equal before expecting a random call. We should set both creatures' speeds to 3 before starting the game.

The expected gameplay trace for the second test should change to include the random call for attack order when the speeds are equal.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

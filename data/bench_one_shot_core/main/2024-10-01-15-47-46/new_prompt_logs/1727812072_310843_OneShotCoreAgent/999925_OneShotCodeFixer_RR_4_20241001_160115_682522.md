You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

Use the engine above to create a game based on the architecture markdowns 

The folder structure should be as follows:
- mini_game_engine
  - engine
    - lib.py (this is already implemented)

- main_game (all your files should be written here)
  - content
    - {model name}.json
  - scenes
    - {scene name}.py
  - tests
    - test_{scene name}.py
  - models.py
  - main.py (the entrypoint)

Relevant existing files (that you should rewrite if needed):
```python main_game/main.py
class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```
```python main_game/models.py
class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"


T = TypeVar('T', bound='AbstractThing')

def create_from_game_database(game_thing_prototype_id: str, game_thing_class: type[T]) -> T:
    """Takes in a prototype_id and uses the content JSON files to bootstrap a hydrated game entity"""
    return game_thing_class.from_prototype_id(game_thing_prototype_id)

```



Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation and then write the necessary files for the creature battler game. Let's start with the plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations
   - Define Skill, Creature, and Player models inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
   - Ensure models are in the correct dependency order
   - Use direct references to other model types, not string IDs or forward references

2. Create `main_game/content/skill.json`:
   - Define skill prototypes as specified in the feature request

3. Create `main_game/content/creature.json`:
   - Define creature prototypes as specified in the feature request

4. Create `main_game/content/player.json`:
   - Define player prototypes as specified in the feature request

5. Update `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement MainMenuScene with options to play or quit
   - Use `_wait_for_choice` and `_show_text` methods
   - Implement `__str__` method to show all relevant information

6. Create `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement MainGameScene with all the battle logic
   - Include Player Choice, Foe Choice, and Resolution phases
   - Implement damage calculation, type relationships, and forced swapping
   - Use `_wait_for_choice` and `_show_text` methods for both human and bot players
   - Implement `__str__` method to show all relevant information

7. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register MainGameScene in the App class

8. Create test files for both scenes in `main_game/tests/`

Now, let's implement these files:

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int

Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the AttributeError related to HumanListener.RandomModeGracefulExit. The error occurs because we're trying to catch an exception that doesn't exist. Instead, we should be catching the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception, which is raised when the game is terminated gracefully.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch the correct exception: AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame.

2. We'll import AbstractApp in these test files to access the _QuitWholeGame exception.

3. We'll keep the HumanListener.random_mode setting, as it's still useful for randomizing choices during testing.

Let's rewrite both test files to implement this fix:

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends gracefully
            pass
```

```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends gracefully
            pass
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the tests to run successfully. We're now catching the correct exception (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) that's raised when the game is terminated gracefully, which can happen in both the MainGameScene and MainMenuScene.

The changes don't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the test files to properly handle the RandomModeGracefulExit exception. The tests are failing because they're not catching this exception, which is raised when the random mode counter reaches zero.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch the RandomModeGracefulExit exception.
2. We'll import RandomModeGracefulExit from the engine's lib module.
3. We'll reset the HumanListener.random_mode_counter before each test run to ensure consistent behavior.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're simply adjusting how we handle the expected exception in our tests.

        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the random mode counter reaches zero
            pass
```

These changes should resolve the test failures by properly handling the RandomModeGracefulExit exception. We're now catching the correct exception that's raised when the random mode counter reaches zero, which can happen in both the MainGameScene and MainMenuScene.

The changes don't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The code is mostly correct and aligns with the architecture described in the documentation.

These discrepancies prevent it from being fully compliant with the architecture.",

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Handle equal speed scenarios in skill execution order by adding a random tiebreaker.
2. Explicitly account for the Normal type being neutral against all other types.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class, specifically in the _resolution_phase and _get_type_effectiveness methods. We don't need to modify any models, as they are already correct and compliant with the architecture.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.
2. In the _get_type_effectiveness method, we'll explicitly handle the Normal type as being neutral against all other types.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. We've added a random tiebreaker in the _resolution_phase method when sorting actions. This ensures that when creatures have equal speed, the order is determined randomly.

2. We've explicitly handled the Normal type in the _get_type_effectiveness method, ensuring it always returns 1 (neutral) against all other types.

These modifications align with the architecture described in the documentation and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, maintaining their status as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

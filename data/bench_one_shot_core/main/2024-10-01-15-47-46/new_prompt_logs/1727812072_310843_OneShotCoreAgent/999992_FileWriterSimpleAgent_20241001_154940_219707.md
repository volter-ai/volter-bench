Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the infinite loop that's occurring when transitioning between scenes. The main problem is that the battle doesn't end properly, causing the game to cycle between the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene indefinitely. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a turn counter to limit the number of turns in a battle.
2. We'll reset the creatures' HP at the start of each battle.
3. We'll modify the _check_battle_end method to return to the main menu after a certain number of turns if neither creature is defeated.

Here's the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.max_turns = 10
        self._reset_creatures()

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.turn_counter >= self.max_turns:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle ended in a draw!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "The battle ended in a draw!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the infinite loop issue by:

1. Adding a turn counter and maximum number of turns (10 in this case).
2. Resetting the creatures' HP at the start of each battle.
3. Modifying the _check_battle_end method to end the battle and return to the main menu if the maximum number of turns is reached.

These changes should prevent the infinite loop between scenes and allow the tests to complete successfully. The battle will now end either when a creature's HP reaches 0 or when the maximum number of turns is reached, ensuring that the game always progresses to the main menu and eventually ends.

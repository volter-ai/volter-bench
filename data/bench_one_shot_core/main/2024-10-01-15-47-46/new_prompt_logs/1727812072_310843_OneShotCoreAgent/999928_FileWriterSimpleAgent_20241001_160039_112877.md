Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the test files to properly handle both the RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions. The tests are failing because they're not catching the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception, which is raised when the game is terminated gracefully.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions.
2. We'll import both exceptions from the engine's lib module.
3. We'll keep resetting the HumanListener.random_mode_counter before each test run to ensure consistent behavior.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're simply adjusting how we handle the expected exceptions in our tests.

Let's rewrite both test files to implement this fix:

# Excerpt ID: 6d10291d-51d3-461d-a922-7b915922ecd5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
        except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
            # These exceptions are expected when the random mode counter reaches zero
            # or when the game ends gracefully
            pass
```

# Excerpt ID: 56e00f45-46f7-4bb9-9782-54b5cf625599
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    for _ in range(10):
        HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
        try:
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
        except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
            # These exceptions are expected when the random mode counter reaches zero
            # or when the game ends gracefully
            pass
```

These changes should resolve the test failures by properly handling both the RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions. We're now catching the correct exceptions that can be raised during the test runs, which can happen in both the MainGameScene and MainMenuScene.

The changes don't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. We're still working within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic. The models remain pure data schemas without methods or properties, and they still inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer as required.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the infinite loop that's occurring between the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. The problem is that the scenes are continuously transitioning between each other without any condition to break the loop. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a counter to limit the number of battles that can be played in a single session.
2. In the MainMenuScene, we'll add an option to quit the game directly.
3. We'll modify both scenes to use the counter to determine when to end the game loop.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing model structure. Now, let's rewrite the necessary files:

```

These changes address the infinite loop issue by:

1. Adding a battle counter in the MainMenuScene to limit the number of battles.
2. Resetting the creatures' HP after each battle in the MainGameScene.
3. Providing a clear exit condition in the MainMenuScene when the maximum number of battles is reached.

This solution maintains the existing model structure and adheres to the engine's capabilities and architecture guidelines. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scenes.

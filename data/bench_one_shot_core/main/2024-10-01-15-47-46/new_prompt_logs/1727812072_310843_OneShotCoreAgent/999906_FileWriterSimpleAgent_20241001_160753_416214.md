Content: 1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the opponent being a bot player. In the MainGameScene, the opponent is created as a bot, but the test created it as a human player. This led to unexpected behavior in the test.

Relevant part of the stdout (hypothetical, as it wasn't provided):
# Excerpt ID: e631f44a-4182-4849-bda5-951f42574d26
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])  # This shouldn't appear for a bot player
```

The relevant part of the code causing this issue is in the `MainGameScene` initialization:

# Excerpt ID: 316921f2-da25-47d5-827c-01b54b34e35b
```python
def __init__(self, app, player):
    super().__init__(app, player)
    self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test created the opponent as a human player instead of a bot.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to modify our test to use a bot opponent:

1. We should create the opponent using `app.create_bot("basic_opponent")` instead of `app.create_player()`.
2. We need to remove the expectations for opponent choices, as bot choices are handled internally and not surfaced as choice events.
3. The expected gameplay trace will change to include only the human player's choices and the random calls for tiebreakers.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

            # Check if player needs to swap

                available_creatures = [c for c in scene.player.creatures if c.hp > 0]
                if available_creatures:
                    choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player1)
                    swap_choice = find_select_thing(choices, available_creatures[0].prototype_id)
                    runner.make_choice(swap_choice)
                else:
                    break  # Player has lost
        except TimeoutError:
            break  # Battle has ended

    # Battle should end here
    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    # Check final state
    assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures) or 
            all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.opponent.creatures))
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the creation and manipulation of the opponent player, as it's now handled by the scene.
2. Removed expectations for opponent choices.
3. Added a loop to continue the battle until it ends, as we can't predict exactly how many turns it will take.
4. Added checks for player swaps when their active creature faints.
5. Made the final state check more flexible, as either the player or the opponent could win.

These changes align the test with the actual game logic, accounting for the bot opponent and the unpredictable nature of the battle.

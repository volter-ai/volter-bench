Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. I'll add these tests to the existing `test_main_game_scene.py` file.

Play-through description:

1. Setup:
   - Create a human player with a Bubwool (water-type) and a Dumbird (normal-type)
   - Create a bot opponent with a Scizard (fire-type) and a Dumbird (normal-type)
   - Start the MainGameScene with these players

2. Play-through steps:
   1. Player chooses "Attack"
   2. Player chooses "Tackle" skill
   3. Bot chooses "Attack"
   4. Bot chooses "Fireball" skill
   5. Resolve actions (Bubwool should go first due to higher speed)
   6. Player chooses "Swap"
   7. Player chooses Dumbird
   8. Bot chooses "Attack"
   9. Bot chooses "Tackle" skill
   10. Resolve actions (Swap happens first, then Dumbird gets hit)
   11. Player chooses "Attack"
   12. Player chooses "Tackle" skill
   13. Bot chooses "Attack"
   14. Bot chooses "Fireball" skill
   15. Resolve actions (Scizard should go first due to higher speed)
   16. Player's Dumbird faints, forced to swap to Bubwool
   17. Bot chooses "Attack"
   18. Bot chooses "Fireball" skill
   19. Player chooses "Attack"
   20. Player chooses "Lick" skill
   21. Resolve actions (Bubwool should go first due to higher speed)
   22. Bot's Scizard faints, forced to swap to Dumbird
   23. Player chooses "Attack"
   24. Player chooses "Tackle" skill
   25. Bot chooses "Attack"
   26. Bot chooses "Tackle" skill
   27. Resolve actions (Bubwool should go first due to higher speed)
   28. Bot's Dumbird faints, battle ends
   29. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

```

This test simulates a full battle in the MainGameScene, covering various scenarios such as attacking, swapping creatures, fainting, and the battle ending. It checks the state of the game at various points to ensure that the logic is working as expected.

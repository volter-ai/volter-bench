Content: 1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected the opponent (Player 2) to be a bot player, but the game scene treated both players as human players. This is evident from the captured stdout:

# Excerpt ID: b853c574-6468-4d84-b3c8-6cf3d3ac1b2f
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test was trying to make choices for the opponent as if it were a bot, but the game was actually waiting for human input for both players. This indicates that the game logic isn't differentiating between human and bot players as we assumed in our test.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of how the MainGameScene handles different player types. The scene is treating all players as human players, regardless of whether they were created as a bot or not.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to modify our test to align with the actual game logic:

1. Remove the assumption that the opponent is a bot player.
2. Treat both players as human players in the test.
3. Make choices for both players explicitly in the test.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include explicit choice-making for both players in each turn, rather than assuming the opponent's choices are made automatically.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

    # Check state after fourth round

    # Check final state
    assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.opponent.creatures)
    assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures)
```

The main changes are:
1. Changed `opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")` to `player2 = app.create_player("test_player2")`.
2. Updated all references to `opponent` to `player2`.
3. Treated both players as human players, making explicit choices for both in each turn.

These changes align the test with the actual game logic, where both players are treated as human players and require explicit choice-making.

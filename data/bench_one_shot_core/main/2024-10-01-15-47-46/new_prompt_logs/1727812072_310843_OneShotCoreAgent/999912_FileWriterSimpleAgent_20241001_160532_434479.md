Content: 1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected an initial creature selection for the player, but the game scene immediately presented the player with the main battle choices (Attack or Swap). This is evident from the captured stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 6f1dec02-9dcf-4cdb-a908-ad4711df1cf6
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test was trying to find a SelectThing choice for "bubwool", but the actual choices were [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)]. This indicates that the game logic doesn't have an initial creature selection phase as we assumed in our test.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in our test. The MainGameScene implementation automatically sets the first creature in the player's list as the active creature, rather than asking the player to choose.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to modify our test to align with the actual game logic:

1. Remove the initial creature selection steps for both player and opponent.
2. Start the test assuming the first creature in each player's list is already active.
3. Begin the test with the main battle choices (Attack or Swap).

The expected gameplay trace will change to start directly with the battle phase, skipping the non-existent creature selection phase.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

    dumbird_choice = find_select_thing(choices, "dumbird")
    runner.make_choice(dumbird_choice)

    # Check state after fourth round

    # Check final state
    assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.opponent.creatures)
    assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures)
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the initial creature selection steps for both player and opponent.
2. The test now starts directly with the first player turn, assuming the first creature in each player's list is already active.
3. The rest of the test logic remains the same, as it should now work correctly with the actual game flow.

These changes align the test with the actual game logic, where the initial active creatures are automatically set without a selection phase.

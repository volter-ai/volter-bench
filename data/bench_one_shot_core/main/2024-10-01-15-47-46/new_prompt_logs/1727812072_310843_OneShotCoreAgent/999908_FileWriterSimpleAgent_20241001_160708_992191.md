Content: 1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the random tiebreaker in the resolution phase of the battle. The game logic uses a random tiebreaker when creatures have equal speed, which wasn't considered in the test. This resulted in an unexpected sequence of events.

Relevant part of the stdout (hypothetical, as it wasn't provided):
# Excerpt ID: 49c672c5-af17-4266-add3-48a15f87b17d
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
random_call(random)  # This is the unexpected random call for tiebreaker
```

The relevant part of the code causing this issue is in the `_resolution_phase` method of `MainGameScene`:

# Excerpt ID: a92e6931-478c-4a8b-a2f0-b732f58c04ff
```python
actions.sort(key=lambda x: (
    0 if x[1][0] == "swap" else 1,
    -x[0].active_creature.speed,
    random.random()  # Random tiebreaker for equal speeds
))
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test didn't account for the random tiebreaker used when creatures have equal speed.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to modify our test to handle the random tiebreaker:

1. We should expect and handle a random call event after each round of choices.
2. We need to set the speed of the creatures to ensure a predictable order of actions.
3. The expected gameplay trace will change to include these random calls and explicit speed settings.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

    # Check final state
    assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.opponent.creatures)
    assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures)
```

The main changes are:
1. Set specific speeds for each creature to ensure a predictable order of actions.
2. Added `runner.dequeue_random_call()` after each round of choices to handle the random tiebreaker.
3. Added assertions to check that the random calls are indeed for the 'random' function.

These changes align the test with the actual game logic, accounting for the random tiebreaker used when creatures have equal speed.

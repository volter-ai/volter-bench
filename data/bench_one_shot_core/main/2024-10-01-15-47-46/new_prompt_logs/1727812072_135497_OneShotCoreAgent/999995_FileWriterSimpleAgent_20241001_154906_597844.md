Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again. We'll update the `run` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. This will ensure that the game loop continues properly.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends and we reset the creatures, we'll add a transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll also add a short delay and a message to inform the player that they're returning to the main menu.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 839015bc-fd7e-4d0a-8b85-5b111a629ab8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Opponent's Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self._show_text(self.opponent, str(self))

            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        
        # Add a short delay and inform the player
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Returning to the main menu...")
        time.sleep(2)
        
        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")

        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp)
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. This maintains the game loop and prevents the scene from terminating without calling `transition_to_scene` again. The added delay and message provide a smooth transition for the player.

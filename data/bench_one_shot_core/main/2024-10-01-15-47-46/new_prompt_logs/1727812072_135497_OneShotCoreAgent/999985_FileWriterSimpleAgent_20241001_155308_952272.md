Content: To address the issue of not explicitly using a queue for skills in the Resolution Phase, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll introduce a queue to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. In the player_choice_phase and foe_choice_phase methods, we'll add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. We'll modify the resolution_phase method to process skills from the queue.
4. We'll update the run method to reflect these changes.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or the overall architecture of the game. It simply introduces a queue for skills as described in the architecture document.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: fc04a5cf-620b-480b-861a-fc9615e32be3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Opponent's Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self._show_text(self.opponent, str(self))

            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()

            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Returning to the main menu...")
        time.sleep(2)
        
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, choice.thing))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            acting_player, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            if acting_player == self.player:
                target = self.opponent_creature
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")
                self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {skill.display_name}!")
            else:
                target = self.player_creature
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {skill.display_name}!")
                self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")

            target.hp -= skill.damage
            target.hp = max(0, target.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

This implementation now explicitly uses a queue (implemented as a `deque`) for skills in the Resolution Phase, addressing the discrepancy noted in the QA pass. The skills are added to the queue in the choice phases and then processed in order during the resolution phase. This change aligns the implementation more closely with the described architecture while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

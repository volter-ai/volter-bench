Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is transitioning to the `MainMenuScene` after each game, which then immediately quits the whole game. This behavior is causing the test to fail because it's not able to run multiple games as intended.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Remove the transition to `MainMenuScene` from the `MainGameScene`.
2. Instead of transitioning, we'll use a loop in the `run` method to allow multiple games.
3. We'll add a counter to limit the number of games played in a single run of the scene.
4. After each game, we'll reset the creatures' HP and give the player a choice to play again or end the scene.
5. If the player chooses to end the scene (or if the maximum number of games is reached), we'll simply return from the `run` method, allowing the test to continue with the next iteration.

This approach will allow the test to run multiple games without transitioning to the `MainMenuScene` or quitting the whole game prematurely.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution allows the `MainGameScene` to run multiple games without transitioning to other scenes or quitting the whole game. It respects the engine's capabilities and maintains the game's flow while fixing the issue raised in the test failures. The scene now has a proper game loop that continues until the player chooses to end the session or the maximum number of games is reached.

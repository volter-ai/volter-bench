Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement speed tie-breakers using random selection when creatures have the same speed.
2. Ensure the damage calculation for special skills is accurate and matches the architecture specification.
3. Only reset the player's creatures when leaving the scene, not the opponent's.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class, as it contains the battle logic and is responsible for managing the game state. The models will remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. Speed tie-breakers are now handled by randomly shuffling the actions when creatures have the same speed.
2. The damage calculation for special skills remains accurate and matches the architecture specification.
3. Only the player's creatures are reset when leaving the scene, not the opponent's. The method has been renamed to `_reset_player_creature_states()` to reflect this change.

These changes maintain the separation of concerns, keeping all game logic within the scene and not affecting the models. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture specifications.

Content: I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the initial player turn order in the MainGameScene. In the game logic, when the scene is initialized, it starts with the human player's turn, not the opponent's turn as the test expected.

Relevant part of the stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 39e7404e-037c-4832-b434-2c33a1581252
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected to make choices for Player 2 (opponent) first, but the game actually started with Player 1's turn.

2. Solution description:

We need to modify the tests to account for the correct turn order in the MainGameScene. Instead of assuming the opponent goes first, we should handle the initial choices for the human player (Player 1) before the opponent (Player 2). We'll need to restructure our `handle_initial_setup` method and the subsequent test cases to reflect the correct turn order.

The expected gameplay trace will change to start with Player 1's turn, followed by Player 2's turn, and then continue with the specific test scenarios.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

```

These changes ensure that we're properly handling the turn order in the MainGameScene, starting with the human player's turn followed by the opponent's turn. We've modified the `handle_initial_setup` method to reflect this order, and adjusted the subsequent test cases accordingly. This should resolve the issue we encountered and more accurately reflect the actual gameplay flow of the MainGameScene.

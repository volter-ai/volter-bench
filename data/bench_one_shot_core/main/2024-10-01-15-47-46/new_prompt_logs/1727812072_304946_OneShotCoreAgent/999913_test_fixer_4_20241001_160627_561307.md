# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True

            break
```

Guidelines:
1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT change the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep every single line of the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes
12. You CANNOT write while loops or for loops in the test. Every event must be tested explicitly and sequentially regardless of how many times it repeats
13. Every test must be a full play-through so the end of every test must be a `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`

Example:
```python {file path}
player1 = app.create_player("test_player")
player1.display_name = "Player 1"  # to disambiguate the players in the console prints
player2 = app.create_bot("default_player")
player2.display_name = "Player 2"  # to disambiguate the players in the console prints
scene = SpecificScene(player)
scene.second_player = player2  # sometimes it might be necessary to set the second player 

runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
runner.start_game(scene)

choices = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x)

## control loops like 'while' and 'for' are not allowed, we must check each choice explicitly in sequence
choices2 = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x2 = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x2)

## every test must be a full play-through so it must end with `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`
assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
```

Each of your tests should describe a full play-through of the scene. During the full play-through, different behaviors of the scene will be tested

Do the following in the same response:
First describes play-through(s) that will be simulated by the test. Try to accomplish the tests with as few play-throughs as possible. Every step of the play through should be described explicitly. Do not say 'repeat X until', list each step. The setup for each play-through must be explicitly described. The setup may be essential for the play-through
Secondly write the tests

You should add your tests to `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
Write out the whole file so I can copy-paste

IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the initial setup of the scene. In the game logic, when the scene is initialized, it sets up the active creatures for both players. The test expected to start with player choices immediately, but the game was first setting up the initial state.

Relevant part of the stdout:
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected to make choices for Player 1 first, but the game actually started with Player 2's turn.

2. Solution description:

We need to modify the tests to account for the initial setup of the scene. Instead of assuming Player 1 goes first, we should handle the initial choices for both players before starting our specific test scenarios. We'll need to restructure our tests to first handle the initial setup, and then proceed with the specific test cases.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include the initial setup for both players before proceeding with the specific test scenarios.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes ensure that we're properly handling the initial setup of the scene in each test. We've added a `handle_initial_setup` method to handle the first round of choices for both players, and we call this method at the beginning of each test. This should resolve the issue we encountered and more accurately reflect the actual gameplay flow of the MainGameScene.

PYTEST_EXIT_CODE: 1




Think carefully and review the architecture doc and the game logic. 



1. First describe what went wrong:

Carefully look at the captured stdout for this test. Explain step-by-step the sequence of events which happened in the stdout and compare it to the mocked choices. Show the relevant part of the stdout and all the lines of the code that are related to this error, describe whether this error is caused by a bad implementation of the test, a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, or a departure of game logic from the architecture. Then describe the specific difference between the expected and the actual and why the difference is there



2. Describe solution

Remember you cannot mock or patch the methods of the game scene other than what is mocked by ThreadedSceneRunner. So if you need to change the test, describe how you can solve this problem without mocking the game scene's methods. You might have to start the logic at an earlier part of the code and 'play' the game until the point you're interested in testing. Describe the exact changes you would make, be very concrete. Does the expected gameplay trace change? If so describe the change



3. Write the solution

Describe the change you will make and write them



Remember the following guidelines:

1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT change the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep every single line of the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes
12. You CANNOT write while loops or for loops in the test. Every event must be tested explicitly and sequentially regardless of how many times it repeats
13. Every test must be a full play-through so the end of every test must be a `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`



Write out the file(s) in the format:

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste.



IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the initial player turn order in the MainGameScene. In the game logic, when the scene is initialized, it starts with the human player's turn, not the opponent's turn as the test expected.

Relevant part of the stdout:
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected to make choices for Player 2 (opponent) first, but the game actually started with Player 1's turn.

2. Solution description:

We need to modify the tests to account for the correct turn order in the MainGameScene. Instead of assuming the opponent goes first, we should handle the initial choices for the human player (Player 1) before the opponent (Player 2). We'll need to restructure our `handle_initial_setup` method and the subsequent test cases to reflect the correct turn order.

The expected gameplay trace will change to start with Player 1's turn, followed by Player 2's turn, and then continue with the specific test scenarios.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

These changes ensure that we're properly handling the turn order in the MainGameScene, starting with the human player's turn followed by the opponent's turn. We've modified the `handle_initial_setup` method to reflect this order, and adjusted the subsequent test cases accordingly. This should resolve the issue we encountered and more accurately reflect the actual gameplay flow of the MainGameScene.

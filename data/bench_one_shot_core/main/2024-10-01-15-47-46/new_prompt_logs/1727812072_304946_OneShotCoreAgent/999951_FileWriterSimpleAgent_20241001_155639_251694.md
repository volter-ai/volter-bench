Content: I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions.

1. What went wrong:

For the test_player_wins_all_battles:
The test expected to find a choice for the player after the second turn, but instead it found a choice for the opponent. This indicates that the battle didn't end as expected after two turns.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: c0748137-e9ac-4efa-a686-fa72e59cecf8
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Tackle), Button(Lick)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Lick)
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Tackle), Button(Fireball)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 5e573dcf-53bf-45aa-960c-365654b3def7
```python
# Player's second turn
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
lick_skill = find_button(choices, "Lick")
runner.make_choice(lick_skill)

# Battle end
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that the battle would end after two turns, but it continued.

For the test_player_loses_and_quits:
The test expected the player's creature to have 0 or less HP after the battle, but it still had 10 HP.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: f23f4e85-9b89-4e75-8f75-b1a48a0b5da6
```
Bubwool used Tackle on Scizard for 3 damage!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Bubwool used Tackle on Scizard for 3 damage!'}
Scizard used Fireball on Bubwool for 2 damage!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Scizard used Fireball on Bubwool for 2 damage!'}
You lost the battle!
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 24855468-292c-4797-9e15-38fa8c0a4191
```python
assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that setting the initial HP to 1 would ensure a loss, but the damage calculation resulted in the player's creature surviving.

2. Solution description:

For test_player_wins_all_battles:
We need to adjust the test to account for the battle continuing until one creature's HP reaches zero. We'll need to repeat the turn sequence until the battle ends, then check for the "Continue" button, and repeat this process for all three battles.

For test_player_loses_and_quits:
We need to adjust the initial stats of the creatures to ensure that the player's creature loses in one hit. We'll increase the opponent's attack and decrease the player's defense further.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: 60426662-a619-4613-b657-4e434811eb4e

    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
    assert scene.battle_count == 1
    assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0
    assert scene.opponent_creature.hp > 0
```

These changes address the issues in both tests by correctly following the game's logic and structure. The tests now accurately reflect the expected gameplay and should pass successfully.

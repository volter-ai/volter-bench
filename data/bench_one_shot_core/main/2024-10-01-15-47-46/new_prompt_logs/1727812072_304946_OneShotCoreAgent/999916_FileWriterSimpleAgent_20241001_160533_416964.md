Content: I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the random speed tie-breaker in the game logic. In the game logic, when both creatures have the same speed, the order of actions is decided randomly. The test expected a fixed order of actions, but the game was using random selection to determine the order.

Relevant part of the stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 70fdd4d9-06f7-4eb0-a633-3342280dd7e2
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
random_call: shuffle
```

The test expected to make choices for Player 1 and Player 2 in a fixed order, but the game used a random shuffle to determine the order of actions.

2. Solution description:

We need to modify the tests to account for the random speed tie-breaker. Instead of assuming a fixed order of actions, we should handle both possible orders. We'll need to restructure our tests to check for both possibilities after each round of combat.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include both possible orders of actions after each round of combat.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes ensure that we're properly handling the random speed tie-breaker in each test. We now dequeue and assert the random call after each round of combat, and we've adjusted our assertions to account for both possible orders of actions. This should resolve the issue we encountered and more accurately reflect the actual gameplay flow of the MainGameScene.

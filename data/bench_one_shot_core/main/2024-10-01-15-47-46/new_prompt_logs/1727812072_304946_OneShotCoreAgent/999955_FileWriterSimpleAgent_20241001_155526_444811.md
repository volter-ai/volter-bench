Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the plan for two play-throughs that will cover different aspects of the MainGameScene:

Play-through 1: Player wins all battles
Setup:
- Create a player with a Bubwool (water-type)
- Create an opponent with a Scizard (fire-type)
- Set Bubwool's speed higher than Scizard's

Steps:
1. Player chooses "Lick" skill
2. Opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
3. Bubwool attacks first due to higher speed
4. Scizard attacks
5. Repeat steps 1-4 until Scizard's HP reaches 0
6. Player wins the battle
7. Player chooses to continue
8. Repeat steps 1-7 two more times
9. After the third battle, the scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Play-through 2: Player loses one battle and quits
Setup:
- Create a player with a Bubwool (water-type)
- Create an opponent with a Scizard (fire-type)
- Set Scizard's speed higher than Bubwool's
- Set Scizard's attack very high to ensure it can defeat Bubwool in one hit

Steps:
1. Opponent chooses "Fireball" skill
2. Player chooses "Tackle" skill
3. Scizard attacks first due to higher speed
4. Bubwool's HP reaches 0
5. Player loses the battle
6. Player chooses to quit to Main Menu

Now, let's write the tests based on these play-throughs:

    runner.make_choice(quit_button)

    assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
    assert scene.battle_count == 1
```

This test file includes the original random test and two new tests based on the play-throughs described earlier. The tests cover different scenarios and ensure that the MainGameScene behaves correctly in various situations.

Content: I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it didn't account for the initial setup of the scene. In the game logic, when the scene is initialized, it sets up the active creatures for both players. The test expected to start with player choices immediately, but the game was first setting up the initial state.

Relevant part of the stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 8cc69956-35e5-41b1-a7d5-6309532dae91
```
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 2, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice(Player 1, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected to make choices for Player 1 first, but the game actually started with Player 2's turn.

2. Solution description:

We need to modify the tests to account for the initial setup of the scene. Instead of assuming Player 1 goes first, we should handle the initial choices for both players before starting our specific test scenarios. We'll need to restructure our tests to first handle the initial setup, and then proceed with the specific test cases.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include the initial setup for both players before proceeding with the specific test scenarios.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes ensure that we're properly handling the initial setup of the scene in each test. We've added a `handle_initial_setup` method to handle the first round of choices for both players, and we call this method at the beginning of each test. This should resolve the issue we encountered and more accurately reflect the actual gameplay flow of the MainGameScene.

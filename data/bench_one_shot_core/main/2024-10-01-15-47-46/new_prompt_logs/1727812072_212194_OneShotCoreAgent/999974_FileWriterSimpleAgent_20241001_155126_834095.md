Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the following problem:

1. The MainMenuScene is not transitioning to the MainGameScene when the "Play" button is selected, causing the assertion `app.transition_count > 0` to fail.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the MainMenuScene to ensure it transitions to the MainGameScene when the "Play" button is selected.
2. We'll add a print statement to help debug the flow of the scene.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture.

Let's rewrite the MainMenuScene file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 02a7f1c1-f39a-42df-87ce-c1ff4a3b1972
```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __str__(self):
        return "Welcome to Creature Battle!\n1. Play\n2. Quit"

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to Creature Battle!")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [
            Button("Play"),
            Button("Quit")
        ])

        print(f"Player chose: {choice.display_name}")  # Debug print

        if choice.display_name == "Play":
            print("Transitioning to MainGameScene")  # Debug print
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        elif choice.display_name == "Quit":
            print("Quitting the game")  # Debug print
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This modification ensures that:

1. The scene transitions to the MainGameScene when the "Play" button is selected.
2. We've added print statements to help debug the flow of the scene.

These changes should resolve the test failure while maintaining the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are still pure data schemas without methods or properties.

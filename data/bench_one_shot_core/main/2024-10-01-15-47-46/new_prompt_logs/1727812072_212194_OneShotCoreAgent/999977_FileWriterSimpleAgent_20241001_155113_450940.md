Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address the following problems:

1. The tests are failing because they're not handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game is supposed to end.
2. The tests are running indefinitely, causing a stack overflow due to continuous scene transitions.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the test files to catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll limit the number of scene transitions in the tests to prevent infinite loops.
3. We'll reset the creature's HP after each battle to ensure consistent test behavior.

Let's rewrite the necessary files with these fixes:

        super().transition_to_scene(scene_name, **kwargs)

    # Reset creature HP after the battle
    player.creatures[0].hp = player.creatures[0].max_hp

    assert app.transition_count <= app.max_transitions, "The game should not exceed the maximum number of transitions"
```

        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:

        return bot

    def transition_to_scene(self, scene_name: str, **kwargs):
        self.transition_count += 1
        if self.transition_count > self.max_transitions:
            raise AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame("Max transitions reached")
        super().transition_to_scene(scene_name, **kwargs)

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
    
    try:
        scene.run()
    except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
        pass  # Expected exception when the game ends

    assert app.transition_count > 0, "The game should have transitioned at least once"
    assert app.transition_count <= app.max_transitions, "The game should not exceed the maximum number of transitions"
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Catching the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception in the test functions, which is the expected behavior when the game ends.
2. Introducing a `transition_count` and `max_transitions` in the TestApp to limit the number of scene transitions and prevent infinite loops.
3. Resetting the creature's HP after each battle in the `test_main_game_scene` function to ensure consistent test behavior.
4. Adding assertions to check that the game has transitioned at least once and hasn't exceeded the maximum number of transitions.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are still pure data schemas without methods or properties.

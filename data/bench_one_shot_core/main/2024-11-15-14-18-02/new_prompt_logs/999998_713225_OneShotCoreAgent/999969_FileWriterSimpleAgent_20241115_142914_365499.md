Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that we forgot to import the `random` module in the main_game_scene.py file. This is a simple fix that just requires adding the import statement at the top of the file. The error occurs in the resolve_actions method where we use random.random() to determine turn order when speeds are equal.

This fix stays within the engine capabilities and doesn't affect the models or architecture - it's just adding a missing import.

2. Here's the complete fixed file:

The only change was adding `import random` at the top of the file. This should resolve the NameError that was occurring when trying to use random.random().

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without any methods or properties. The logic for resetting creatures should be moved to the scene instead.

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Remove all methods from the models in `models.py`
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it's actually used
3. Add a helper method in MainGameScene to reset creature HP values
4. Update the scene initialization to use this helper method

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 55574230-122d-4abb-b01c-a2cdbaa008d1
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And here's how the MainGameScene should handle the reset logic:

# Excerpt ID: aebeeca3-f6dd-45cd-acb8-a0a3132e2d8b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self._reset_player_creatures(self.player)
        self._reset_player_creatures(self.bot)
        
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed all methods from the model classes
2. Added `_reset_player_creatures` helper method in MainGameScene
3. Updated initialization to use the helper method instead of calling model methods
4. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while following the architectural guidelines correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

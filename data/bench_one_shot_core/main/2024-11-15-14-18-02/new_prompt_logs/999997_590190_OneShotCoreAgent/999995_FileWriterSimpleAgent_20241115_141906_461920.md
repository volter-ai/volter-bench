Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp back to max_hp directly in the scene

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 44e72dad-af97-40e1-97b7-a00457ef8bea
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"

    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int

```

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._handle_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_turn(self, current_player, creature):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        for i, choice in enumerate(choices):
            choice.value = {"skill": creature.skills[i]}
            
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.value["skill"]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Changed the reset logic in MainGameScene to directly set hp = max_hp
3. Kept all models as pure data schemas

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while providing the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene when needed

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: f5ba631c-82ce-458b-bbee-9073b589b806
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")

        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):

        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            # Apply bot skill
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Directly set hp = max_hp in the MainGameScene where needed
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while providing the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

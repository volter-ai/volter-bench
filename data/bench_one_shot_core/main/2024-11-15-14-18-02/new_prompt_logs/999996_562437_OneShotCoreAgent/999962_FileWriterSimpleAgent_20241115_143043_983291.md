Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that we need to reset creature states when leaving MainGameScene. According to the docs: "When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

Looking at the architecture:
- Models can't have methods, so we can't add reset() there
- The scene should handle state management
- We need to reset before transitioning away from MainGameScene

Solution:
- Add a reset_creatures() method to MainGameScene
- Call it before any transition_to_scene calls
- This maintains pure data models while properly managing game state

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added reset_creatures() method to handle state reset
2. Called reset_creatures() before transitioning in check_battle_end()
3. Reset includes setting hp back to max_hp and clearing active_creature
4. Maintained pure data models by keeping all logic in the scene
5. Properly implemented the requirement to reset state when leaving the scene

This should resolve the QA issue while maintaining proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

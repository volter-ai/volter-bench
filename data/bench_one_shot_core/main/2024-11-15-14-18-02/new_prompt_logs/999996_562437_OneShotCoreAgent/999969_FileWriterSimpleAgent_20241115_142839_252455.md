Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because MainGameScene tries to call `reset()` on the Player model, but models can't have methods. Instead, we should move all initialization logic into the MainGameScene itself. The scene should:

- Set hp = max_hp for each creature directly
- Set active_creature directly 
- Not rely on any model methods

This maintains pure data models while keeping game logic in scenes.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed calls to `reset()` method
2. Directly set hp = max_hp for each creature in __init__
3. Directly set active_creature for both players
4. Kept all game logic within the scene

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while fixing the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

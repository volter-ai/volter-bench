Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference undefined variables `player_action` and `opponent_action`. The issue is that we're trying to determine which player is the attacker by comparing the action tuple against these undefined variables.

Solution:
- Instead of trying to compare the whole action tuple, we should pass the attacker and defender directly to execute_action
- This maintains clean separation of concerns and avoids referencing undefined variables
- The resolve_actions method should determine who is attacking/defending and pass that info to execute_action

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Modified resolve_actions to explicitly pass attacker and defender to execute_action
2. Changed execute_action signature to take attacker and defender parameters
3. Removed the problematic action comparison that was causing the NameError
4. Maintained clean separation between models and game logic
5. Kept all game state management within the scene

This should resolve the test failures while maintaining proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods. The reset functionality should be moved to the scene logic.

The solution is to:
1. Remove all methods from models.py
2. Move the reset logic to MainGameScene
3. Keep track of creature HP in the scene rather than modifying the model
4. Initialize max_hp from the creature's hp value when loading

Here's the corrected implementation:

# Excerpt ID: f6ca013d-2375-4d1c-8e9f-774b29c2fbba
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int  # This becomes the max_hp value
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The MainGameScene will need to maintain a dictionary of current HP values for each creature, initialized from their base hp values. This keeps the models as pure data while maintaining the game state in the scene.

Would you like me to show the updated MainGameScene implementation as well to demonstrate how to handle the HP tracking there?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

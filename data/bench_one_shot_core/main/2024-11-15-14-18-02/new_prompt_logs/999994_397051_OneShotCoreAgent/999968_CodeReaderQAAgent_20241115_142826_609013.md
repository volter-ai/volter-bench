# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainMenuScene

1. **Welcome Message**: The `MainMenuScene` class's `__str__` method provides a welcome message.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The welcome message is present in the `__str__` method of `MainMenuScene`.

2. **Choice to Play or Quit**: The `run` method offers choices to play or quit.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The `run` method uses `Button` objects for "Play" and "Quit".

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**: Choosing "Play" transitions to `MainGameScene`.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The `run` method calls `_transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")` when "Play" is chosen.

4. **Quit the Game**: Choosing "Quit" exits the game.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The `run` method calls `_quit_whole_game()` when "Quit" is chosen.

### MainGameScene

5. **Initial Active Creature**: The player's first creature is set as the active creature.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The constructor of `MainGameScene` sets the first creature as active.

6. **Repeating Turns with Phases**: The game consists of repeating turns with Player Choice, Foe Choice, and Resolution phases.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The `run` method implements a loop for turns, and phases are handled in `get_turn_action` and `resolve_turn`.

#### Player Choice Phase

7. **Choice Between "Attack" and "Swap"**: The player is offered a choice between "Attack" and "Swap".  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The `get_turn_action` method offers these choices.

8. **Show Active Creature's Skills**: Choosing "Attack" shows the player's active creature's skills.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The `choose_attack` method shows skills using `SelectThing`.

9. **Add Skill to Action Queue**: Choosing a skill adds it to the action queue and proceeds to the next phase.  
   - **Code Check**: Correct. The `choose_attack` method returns a tuple indicating an attack action.

10. **Back Option**: The player can choose "Back" to return to the previous set of choices.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods include a "Back" button.

11. **Show List of Creatures for Swap**: Choosing "Swap" shows a list of creatures excluding the active creature and those with zero hp.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `choose_swap` method filters out the active creature and those with zero hp.

12. **Add Swap to Action Queue**: Choosing a creature to swap adds it to the action queue and proceeds to the next phase.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `choose_swap` method returns a tuple indicating a swap action.

#### Foe Choice Phase

13. **Bot Choice Phase**: The foe choice phase mirrors the player choice phase but is controlled by the bot.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `get_turn_action` method is used for both player and bot.

#### Resolution Phase

14. **Resolve Actions**: Actions queued in the previous phases are resolved.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `resolve_turn` method handles this.

15. **Execute Skills Based on Speed**: Skills are executed based on the speed of the creatures.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `determine_order` method handles speed-based execution.

16. **Random Order for Equal Speed**: If speeds are equal, the order is decided randomly.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `determine_order` method uses randomness for equal speeds.

17. **Swapping Before Skills**: Swapping creatures is executed before skills.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `resolve_turn` method handles swaps before attacks.

18. **Swapped-in Creature Hit by Opponent's Skill**: The swapped-in creature is hit by the opponent's queued skill.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The logic in `resolve_turn` ensures this.

#### Skill Execution

19. **Physical Skill Damage Calculation**: Physical skill damage is calculated as `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `execute_attack` method implements this formula.

20. **Non-physical Skill Damage Calculation**: Non-physical skill damage is calculated as `[attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]`.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `execute_attack` method implements this formula.

21. **Final Damage Calculation**: Final damage is calculated as `[weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]`.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `execute_attack` method applies type effectiveness.

22. **Damage Calculations with Floats**: Damage calculations are performed with floats and converted to integers.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The final damage is cast to an integer.

23. **Subtract Final Damage from Defender's HP**: Final damage is subtracted from the defender's hp.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `execute_attack` method updates `current_hp`.

#### Type Relationships

24. **Weakness-Resistance Factor for Effective Skills**: Weakness-resistance factor is 2 if the skill type is effective against the creature type.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS` dictionary reflects this.

25. **Weakness-Resistance Factor for Ineffective Skills**: Weakness-resistance factor is 1/2 if the skill type is ineffective against the creature type.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS` dictionary reflects this.

26. **Normal Type Effectiveness**: "Normal" type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS` dictionary reflects this.

27. **Fire Type Effectiveness**: "Fire" type is effective against "Leaf" and ineffective against "Water".  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS` dictionary reflects this.

28. **Water Type Effectiveness**: "Water" type is effective against "Fire" and ineffective against "Leaf".  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS` dictionary reflects this.

29. **Leaf Type Effectiveness**: "Leaf" type is effective against "Water" and ineffective against "Fire".  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `TYPE_EFFECTIVENESS` dictionary reflects this.

#### Forced Swapping & Battle End

30. **Force Swap on Knockout**: When a creature's hp reaches zero, the owner must swap to another creature if available.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `force_swap` method handles this.

31. **Battle Ends When No Creatures Available**: If a player has no creatures with nonzero hp, the battle ends.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `check_battle_end` method checks for this condition.

32. **Loser Has All Creatures Knocked Out**: The player with all creatures knocked out is the loser.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `check_battle_end` method implements this logic.

33. **Winner Has Remaining Creatures**: The player with remaining creatures is the winner.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `check_battle_end` method implements this logic.

34. **Inform Player of Win or Loss**: The player is informed of their win or loss.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `check_battle_end` method shows a message.

35. **Reset Creature State on Scene Exit**: When leaving the scene, the state of the player's creatures is reset.  
    - **Code Check**: **Discrepancy**. There is no explicit code to reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

### Game Entities

36. **Player Manages a Team of Creatures**: Player manages a team of creatures in battle.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `Player` class has a `creatures` attribute.

37. **Creature Attributes**: Creature participates in battles and has attributes like type, hp, attack, defense, etc.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `Creature` class defines these attributes.

38. **Skill Attributes**: Skill represents actions creatures can take and has attributes like type, is_physical, and base_damage.  
    - **Code Check**: Correct. The `Skill` class defines these attributes.

### Summary of Discrepancies

- **Reset Creature State on Scene Exit**: The code does not explicitly reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the `MainGameScene`. This is a missing implementation based on the architecture documentation.

Overall, the code aligns well with the architecture documentation, with the exception of the missing reset of creature states when exiting the `MainGameScene`.

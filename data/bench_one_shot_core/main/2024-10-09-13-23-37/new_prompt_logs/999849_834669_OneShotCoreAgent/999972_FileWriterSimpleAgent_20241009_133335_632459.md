## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random resolution for equal speed:
   - In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll add a random factor when sorting the turn queue for creatures with equal speed.

2. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   - After each skill execution, we'll check if the defender's creature has been knocked out. If so, we'll force a swap to a new creature if available.

3. Explicitly manage the normal type's neutrality:
   - In the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method, we'll add a specific case for the "normal" type to ensure it's always neutral (factor 1) against all other types.

Here's the updated `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. Equal speed resolution is now handled randomly by adding a random factor to the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method.
2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the `_execute_skill` method, which calls the new `_force_swap` method when necessary.
3. The normal type's neutrality against all other types is explicitly managed in the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method by always returning 1 for normal-type skills.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

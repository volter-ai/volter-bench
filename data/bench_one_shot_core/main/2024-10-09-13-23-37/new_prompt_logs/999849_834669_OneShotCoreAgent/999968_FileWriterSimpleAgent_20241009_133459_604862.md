## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the two issues mentioned: informing other players when waiting for a player's choice, and resetting the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

1. To fix these issues, I will:
   a) Add a call to inform other players when waiting for a player's choice in the `_player_choice_phase` method.
   b) Implement a method to reset the state of all creatures when leaving the scene, and call it in the `_end_battle` method.

2. I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to incorporate these changes. Here's the updated file:

# Excerpt ID: ef3a608b-4f4a-4c18-9ab7-abca88967aca

        super().__init__(app, player)

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, we now inform the other player that we're waiting for the current player's choice using the `on_show_event` method with an `OnGamePending` event.

2. We've added a new `_reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum values. This method is called in the `_end_battle` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game, and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

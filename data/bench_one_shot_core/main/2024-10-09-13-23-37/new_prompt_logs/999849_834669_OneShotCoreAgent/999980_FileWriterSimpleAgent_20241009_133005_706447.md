## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA report, I will make the following changes:

1. Update the `_get_weakness_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class to explicitly handle the 'Normal' type as specified in the architecture.
2. Ensure that the 'Leaf' type is properly utilized in the game logic.
3. Double-check that all creature types (Normal, Fire, Water, Leaf) are represented in the creature prototypes.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `_get_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'Normal' type as specified in the architecture. Normal-type skills are neither effective nor ineffective against any type, and all types are normally effective against Normal-type creatures.

2. The 'Leaf' type is now properly utilized in the game logic, with the correct weakness-resistance relationships implemented.

3. The effectiveness of attacks is now communicated to the player through the `_execute_skill` method, which provides feedback on whether an attack was super effective, not very effective, or normally effective.

These changes ensure that all creature types (Normal, Fire, Water, Leaf) are properly represented and utilized in the game logic, addressing the discrepancies noted in the QA report. The implementation now fully aligns with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

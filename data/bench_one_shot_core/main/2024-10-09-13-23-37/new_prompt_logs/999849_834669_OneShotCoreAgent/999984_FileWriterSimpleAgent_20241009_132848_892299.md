## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both the random decision-making for equal speed and the missing 'Leaf' type implementation.

1. To fix these issues, I will:
   a) Modify the `_resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include random decision-making when creatures have equal speed.
   b) Update the `_get_weakness_factor` method to include the 'Leaf' type in the type relationships.
   c) Add a 'Leaf' type skill to the `skill.json` file.
   d) Add a 'Leaf' type creature to the `creature.json` file.

2. Here are the files that need to be updated:

These changes address both issues:

1. The `_resolve_turn` method now includes random decision-making when creatures have equal speed.
2. The 'Leaf' type is now fully implemented in the type relationships, and new leaf-type skill and creature have been added to the respective JSON files.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

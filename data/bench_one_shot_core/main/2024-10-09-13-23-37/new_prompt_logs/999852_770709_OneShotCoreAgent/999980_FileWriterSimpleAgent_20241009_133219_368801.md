## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Implement a random decision for equal speeds in the battle resolution.
2. Remove the 'Leaf' type from the type relationships, as there are no corresponding creatures or skills.
3. Remove the extra delay for dramatic effect that wasn't mentioned in the architecture.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the _resolve_turn method, we'll add a random decision when the speeds are equal.
2. We'll update the _get_weakness_factor method to remove references to the 'Leaf' type.
3. We'll remove the extra delay in the _opponent_turn method.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            # Equal speeds, randomly decide who goes first

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The _resolve_turn method now includes a random decision when the speeds are equal, using random.choice to determine which creature goes first.
2. The _get_weakness_factor method has been updated to remove references to the 'Leaf' type, keeping only the relationships between 'Fire', 'Water', and 'Normal' types.
3. The extra delay for dramatic effect has been removed from the _opponent_turn method.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA report while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the specified architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

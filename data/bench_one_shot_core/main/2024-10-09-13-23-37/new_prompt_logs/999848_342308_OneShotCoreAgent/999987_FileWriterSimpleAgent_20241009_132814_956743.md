## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when creatures have equal speed in the `MainGameScene`.
2. Add the "Leaf" type to the game content by updating the `skill.json` and `creature.json` files.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, I'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method to use random.choice when the speeds are equal.
2. I'll add a new skill "Vine Whip" of type "leaf" to the `skill.json` file.
3. I'll add a new creature "Leafeon" of type "leaf" to the `creature.json` file.
4. I'll update the `player.json` file to include a new player prototype with the Leafeon creature.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with the proposed solutions:

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_resolve_turn` method in `MainGameScene` now uses `random.shuffle` to determine the order of skill execution when creatures have equal speed.
2. The "Leaf" type has been added to the game content:
   - A new "Vine Whip" skill of type "leaf" has been added to `skill.json`.
   - A new "Leafeon" creature of type "leaf" has been added to `creature.json`.
   - A new "Leaf Player" prototype has been added to `player.json`.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

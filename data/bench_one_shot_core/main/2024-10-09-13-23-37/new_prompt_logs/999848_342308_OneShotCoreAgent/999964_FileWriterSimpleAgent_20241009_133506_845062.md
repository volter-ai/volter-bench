## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised, and I'll address them by aligning the damage calculation logic more closely with the architecture description. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Revise the damage calculation for physical and special attacks to match the architecture description exactly.
2. Remove the minimum damage constraint, as it's not specified in the architecture.
3. Ensure that all calculations use floating-point arithmetic until the final step, where we'll round to an integer.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file, as the models should remain pure data schemas. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 676ed6cb-6bfc-4fff-81e9-e5c0fc53e735
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {damage} damage.")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill) -> int:
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense)) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = raw_damage * weakness_factor

        return int(round(final_damage))

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_weakness_factor(skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {},
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _transition_to_scene(self, scene_name: str):
        self.reset_creatures()
        super()._transition_to_scene(scene_name)

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation for physical attacks now exactly matches the architecture description: `[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`
2. The damage calculation for special attacks now exactly matches the architecture description: `[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]`
3. The minimum damage constraint has been removed.
4. All calculations use floating-point arithmetic until the final step, where we round to an integer.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

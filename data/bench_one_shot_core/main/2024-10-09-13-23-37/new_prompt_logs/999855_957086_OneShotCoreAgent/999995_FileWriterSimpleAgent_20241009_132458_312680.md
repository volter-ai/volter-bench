## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is causing the test to fail. We'll update the `run` method to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the main menu.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when `check_battle_end` returns True), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the main menu or quit the whole game.
3. We'll move the `reset_creatures` call to happen before transitioning or quitting, to ensure the creatures are reset for the next game.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3cacd54c-74a9-4749-9aa3-732a8b737b50
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self.handle_end_of_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def handle_end_of_battle(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` class addresses the issue by properly handling the end of the battle. After the battle ends, it resets the creatures' HP and then prompts the player to either play again or quit. Based on the player's choice, it either transitions back to the main menu or quits the whole game. This ensures that the scene always exits in an expected manner, either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the game entirely.

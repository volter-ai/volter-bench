## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The game flow is not properly handling the end of the battle.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the scene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 78a95055-85d1-47ed-b5c2-3a1544207416
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.foe.display_name}: {self.foe_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.foe_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` call at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that the scene properly exits and transitions back to the main menu.
2. Modifying the `reset_creatures` method to only reset the HP of the creatures involved in the battle, rather than all creatures.
3. Calling `reset_creatures` before transitioning to the main menu, ensuring that the creatures' HP is reset for the next battle.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected, with proper scene transitions and creature HP management.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each of these problems in the MainGameScene implementation. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Random resolution for equal speeds: We'll modify the _resolve_turn method to randomly determine the order when creatures have equal speed.

2. Explicit float to integer conversion for damage: We'll update the _use_skill method to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the int() function.

3. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero: We'll add a new method _check_and_swap_fainted_creature to handle forced swapping, and call it after each skill use.

These changes will be implemented in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's the updated implementation:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Random resolution for equal speeds is now implemented in the `_resolve_turn` method.
2. Explicit float to integer conversion is done in the `_use_skill` method.
3. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is handled by the new `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method, which is called after each skill use.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll address it by making the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Add an explicit welcome message at the beginning of the battle.
2. Remove the extra implementations for displaying messages during battle that are not specified in the architecture.

Here's how I'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. Add a welcome message in the `run` method before the battle starts.
2. Remove the `_show_text` calls during skill execution, as they're not specified in the architecture.
3. Keep only the essential battle logic and end conditions as described in the architecture document.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: da357493-c663-4734-85d4-29cf851c55e3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to the Creature Battle!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed or \
           (self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed and random.choice([True, False])):
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. It adds an explicit welcome message at the beginning of the battle.
2. It removes the extra implementations for displaying messages during battle that were not specified in the architecture.
3. It keeps only the essential battle logic and end conditions as described in the architecture document.

The implementation now more closely follows the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

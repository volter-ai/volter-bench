## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the MainGameScene to explicitly implement a queue for skills and remove them after execution in the Resolution Phase. Here's how I plan to fix this:

1. Add a queue for skills in the MainGameScene class.
2. Modify the player_choice_phase and bot_choice_phase methods to add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the resolution_phase method to process skills from the queue and explicitly remove them after execution.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2c3787d0-774e-480f-addd-a1dc54d16a98
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.bot_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, choice.thing))

    def bot_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.bot, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            if attacker == self.player:
                defender = self.bot
                attacker_creature = self.player_creature
                defender_creature = self.bot_creature
            else:
                defender = self.player
                attacker_creature = self.bot_creature
                defender_creature = self.player_creature

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Introducing a `skill_queue` using `collections.deque()` to store the skills chosen by both the player and the bot.
2. Modifying `player_choice_phase` and `bot_choice_phase` to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them.
3. Updating the `resolution_phase` to process skills from the queue and explicitly remove them after execution using `self.skill_queue.popleft()`.

These changes ensure that the Resolution Phase explicitly removes skills from a queue after they are executed, as required by the architecture documentation. The rest of the game logic remains intact, and this solution stays within the capabilities of the engine while maintaining the structure of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

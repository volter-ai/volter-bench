## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' in the App class. The error occurs because we're trying to use MainMenuScene before it's imported. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `main.py` file to import the necessary scene classes at the top of the file.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary imports are present and in the correct order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the architecture. It doesn't affect the models, which remain pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the `main.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 84256049-2565-46a8-b643-97a3c0f2189e
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This change should resolve the NameError we were encountering. By importing the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes at the top of the file, we ensure that they are available when the App class is initialized.

This solution maintains the structure of the game and doesn't affect the models or the overall architecture. It simply fixes the import issue that was causing the tests to fail.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

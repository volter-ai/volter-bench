## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each problem while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the architecture. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. Correct the special skill damage calculation in the `calculate_damage` method.
2. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The models will remain unchanged as they are pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. The special skill damage calculation is now correct, using the ratio of sp_attack to sp_defense multiplied by the base damage.
2. Forced swapping is implemented in the `check_and_force_swap` method, which is called after each turn for both players.
3. The `reset_creatures_state` method is added and called at the end of the `run` method to reset all creatures' HP when leaving the scene.

These changes maintain the structure of the game and don't affect the models, which remain pure data schemas. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the validation error for the `active_creature` field in the `Player` class. The error occurs because the `active_creature` field is not initialized when creating a player from the prototype. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]` and setting a default value of `None`.

2. We'll update the `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` class to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

Here's the updated `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ce6a0de2-0274-4e9f-8cba-cc034823ab49
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional and sets its default value to `None`. This will prevent the validation error when creating a player from the prototype.

Now, we need to update the `MainGameScene` class to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle. Here's the updated `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` class:

# Excerpt ID: 50097856-17ff-4d1e-8212-44bdd4c03c45
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
# ... (keep the existing imports and class definition)

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    # ... (keep the existing methods)

    def _initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} sent out {self.player.active_creature.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"{self.bot.display_name} sent out {self.bot.active_creature.display_name}!")

    # ... (keep the rest of the class implementation)
```

These changes should resolve the validation error and allow the game to run properly. The `active_creature` will be set at the beginning of each battle, ensuring that it's always initialized when needed.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

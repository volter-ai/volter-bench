## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll also add a check to ensure that the game doesn't continue if a player's creature's HP drops to 0 or below during the battle.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: cc91a8f1-730f-4c3d-b31b-54b1bf1cbf23
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.choose_skill(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.choose_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_skills(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to the main menu after the battle

    def choose_skill(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_skills(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - opponent_skill.damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. We've added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method to ensure that the scene always transitions back to the main menu after a battle ends.
2. In the `resolve_skills` method, we've added a check to ensure that the opponent's creature's HP doesn't go below 0, and we only apply the opponent's skill if their creature is still alive.
3. We've used `max(0, ...)` when reducing HP to ensure it never goes below 0.

These changes should fix the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning to another scene. The game flow will now be more robust, handling the end of battles correctly and returning to the main menu.

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creature's state at the end of the battle.
3. We'll call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's how we'll implement this solution:

# Excerpt ID: f3b60880-b10e-480a-a535-6a4049315fe6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.foe.display_name}: {self.foe_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creature_states()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.foe_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creature_states(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

In this updated version of `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`, we've added a new method called `reset_creature_states()`. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the foe to their maximum HP.

We call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the `run()` method:

# Excerpt ID: 68166296-52dc-424a-af2e-e4ed1e7e7487
```python
    def run(self):
        while True:
            # ... (battle logic)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creature_states()  # Reset creature states before transitioning
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This ensures that the player's creature state is reset when transitioning out of MainGameScene, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the discrepancy in the Resolution Phase where skills are not being queued before being resolved, as per the described architecture.

1. Description of the fix:

To align with the architecture, we'll modify the MainGameScene to implement a queuing mechanism for skills. Here's how we'll do it:

a. Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the MainGameScene class to store the queued skills.
b. Modify the `run` method to separate the choice phases from the resolution phase.
c. Create a new `queue_skill` method to add skills to the queue.
d. Update the `resolve_skills` method to process all skills in the queue.

This approach will maintain the separation of the choice phases and the resolution phase, adhering more closely to the described architecture.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1bcbb6c1-ea56-458b-a7d8-ef2d73614c07
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from typing import List, Tuple
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Player, Creature, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Clear the skill queue at the start of each turn
            self.skill_queue.clear()

            # Player Choice Phase
            self.queue_skill(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.queue_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_skills()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to the main menu after the battle

    def queue_skill(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((current_player, current_creature, choice.thing))

    def resolve_skills(self):
        for player, creature, skill in self.skill_queue:
            if player == self.player:
                target_creature = self.opponent_creature
                target_player = self.opponent
            else:
                target_creature = self.player_creature
                target_player = self.player

            target_creature.hp = max(0, target_creature.hp - skill.damage)
            self._show_text(player, f"Your {creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(target_player, f"Opponent's {creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by introducing a skill queue and separating the choice phases from the resolution phase. The `run` method now clearly shows the three phases: Player Choice, Foe Choice, and Resolution. Skills are queued during the choice phases and then resolved in order during the resolution phase. This aligns with the described architecture and maintains the separation of concerns between the different phases of the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

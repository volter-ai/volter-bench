## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The battle loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle loop to break and transition when a creature faints.
3. We'll add a method to reset creature HP at the start of each battle to ensure multiple battles can be played.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: aeb6fe4b-0ca5-431d-8521-5e428e81a44f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1], first[1].skills[0])
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1], second[1].skills[0])

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures()` method to reset HP at the start of each battle.
2. Ensuring that the battle loop breaks when a creature faints.
3. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flows correctly between scenes. The scene now properly exits by transitioning back to the main menu, adhering to the engine's requirements.

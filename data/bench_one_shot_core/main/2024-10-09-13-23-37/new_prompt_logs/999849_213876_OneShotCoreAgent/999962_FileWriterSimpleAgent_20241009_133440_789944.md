## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' in the App class. The problem is that we're trying to use MainMenuScene before it's imported. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll move the scene imports to the top of the main.py file.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary scenes are imported.
3. We'll double-check that the scene classes are correctly defined in their respective files.

Here's the proposed solution for main.py:

# Excerpt ID: 20fa2048-9fcb-491b-bedb-cb21fe27d489
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution imports both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene at the top of the file, ensuring that they are available when the App class is initialized. This should resolve the NameError we were encountering.

Make sure that the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes are correctly defined in their respective files (main_menu_scene.py and main_game_scene.py) in the scenes directory.

If you're still encountering issues after this change, please let me know, and we can further investigate the scene files or other potential sources of the problem.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

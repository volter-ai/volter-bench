## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of missing random decision for execution order when creatures have equal speed in the Resolution Phase.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the solution:

   - Check if the player's creature and opponent's creature have equal speed.
   - If they do, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
   - Implement the turn order based on this random decision when speeds are equal.
   - Keep the existing logic for cases where speeds are not equal.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3a74c94b-654d-4c03-abcb-c50044cc35c5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # After the battle ends, transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            # Randomly decide who goes first when speeds are equal
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.sample([self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature], 2)
            first_skill = player_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
            second_skill = opponent_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else player_skill
        elif self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, second_attacker = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, opponent_skill
        else:
            first_attacker, second_attacker = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = opponent_skill, player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first_attacker, second_attacker, first_skill)
        if second_attacker.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second_attacker, first_attacker, second_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding a random decision for execution order when creatures have equal speed in the Resolution Phase. The `resolve_turn` method now checks if the speeds are equal and uses `random.sample()` to randomly determine the order of attacks in that case. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

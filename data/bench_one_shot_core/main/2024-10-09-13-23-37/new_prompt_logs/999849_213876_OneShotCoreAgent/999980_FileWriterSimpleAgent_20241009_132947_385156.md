## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for overlooking the 'Leaf' type in the weakness-resistance factor calculations. I'll address this issue as follows:

1. Description of the fix:
   - I will modify the `calculate_weakness_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include the 'Leaf' type in the calculations.
   - The method will be updated to account for all type relationships mentioned in the architecture documentation, including:
     - Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
     - Fire is effective against Leaf and ineffective against Water.
     - Water is effective against Fire and ineffective against Leaf.
     - Leaf is effective against Water and ineffective against Fire.
   - This change will ensure that all type relationships are correctly represented in the battle mechanics.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9c995cd9-40f6-4df4-88ac-0fde0aa6037d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # After the battle ends, transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            # Randomly decide who goes first when speeds are equal
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.sample([self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature], 2)
            first_skill = player_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
            second_skill = opponent_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else player_skill
        elif self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, second_attacker = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, opponent_skill
        else:
            first_attacker, second_attacker = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = opponent_skill, player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first_attacker, second_attacker, first_skill)
        if second_attacker.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second_attacker, first_attacker, second_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal" or defender_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire":
            if defender_type == "leaf":
                return 2
            elif defender_type == "water":
                return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water":
            if defender_type == "fire":
                return 2
            elif defender_type == "leaf":
                return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender_type == "water":
                return 2
            elif defender_type == "fire":
                return 0.5
        return 1  # Default case for same type or unspecified relationships

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This implementation addresses the issue by updating the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to include all type relationships mentioned in the architecture documentation, including the 'Leaf' type. The method now correctly calculates the weakness-resistance factor for all possible type combinations, ensuring that the battle mechanics accurately reflect the game design.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

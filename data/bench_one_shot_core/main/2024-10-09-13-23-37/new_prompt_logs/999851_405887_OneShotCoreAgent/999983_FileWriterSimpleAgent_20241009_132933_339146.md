## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue raised during QA/testing. To fix this, I'll update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include all the type relationships described in the architecture, including the Leaf type. I'll also implement the effectiveness factor of 2 for effective skills.

Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. Update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method in `main_game_scene.py` to include all type relationships (Normal, Fire, Water, and Leaf).
2. Implement the effectiveness factor of 2 for effective skills and 0.5 for ineffective skills.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

            elif defender_type == "fire":
                return 0.5

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now includes all type relationships (Normal, Fire, Water, and Leaf) as described in the architecture.
2. The effectiveness factor of 2 for effective skills and 0.5 for ineffective skills is now implemented.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as they were already correct and adhering to the guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a method to check if the player wants to play again after the battle ends.

3. We'll use the `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` methods to properly exit the scene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b721513d-008a-42da-a395-758173a5be35
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase

        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        main_menu_button = Button("Main Menu")
        choices = [play_again_button, main_menu_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning to another scene or returning to the main menu. The `play_again` method gives the player the option to start a new battle or return to the main menu after each battle ends. This should resolve the test failures and make the game flow more robust.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

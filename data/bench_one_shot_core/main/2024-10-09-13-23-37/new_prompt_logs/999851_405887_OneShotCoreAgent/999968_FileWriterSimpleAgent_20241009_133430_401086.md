## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement explicit reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene:
   - Add a new method `_reset_creatures_state()` that will be called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Implement the behavior where a creature that gets swapped in is hit by its opponent's queued skill:
   - Modify the `_resolution_phase()` method to handle this scenario.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, which should remain pure data schemas.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

        self.bot.active_creature = None

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_reset_creatures_state()` method is now called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This method resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum values and sets the active_creature to None for both the player and the bot.

2. The `_resolution_phase()` method now handles the scenario where a swapped-in creature is hit by the opponent's queued skill. If a player swaps and the opponent has an attack queued, the swapped-in creature will be hit by that attack immediately after the swap.

These modifications maintain the integrity of the models as pure data schemas and work within the capabilities of the provided engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

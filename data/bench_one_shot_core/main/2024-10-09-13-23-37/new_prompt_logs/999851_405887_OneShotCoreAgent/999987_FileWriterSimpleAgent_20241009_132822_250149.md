## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose solutions:

1. Remove references to the 'Leaf' type in the weakness factor calculation, as it's not present in our JSON files.
2. Separate the turn phases into distinct methods in the MainGameScene.
3. Use floats for intermediate calculations in the damage calculation.
4. Add a display_name attribute to the Player model.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. Update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method in `main_game_scene.py` to remove 'Leaf' type references.
2. Create separate methods for Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase in `main_game_scene.py`.
3. Modify the damage calculation in `main_game_scene.py` to use floats for intermediate calculations.
4. Add the display_name attribute to the Player model in `models.py`.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with these changes:

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Leaf' type references have been removed from the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
2. The turn phases are now separated into distinct methods: `player_choice_phase`, `foe_choice_phase`, and `resolution_phase`.
3. The damage calculation now uses floats for intermediate calculations, with the final damage being converted to an integer.
4. The Player model now includes a display_name attribute.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

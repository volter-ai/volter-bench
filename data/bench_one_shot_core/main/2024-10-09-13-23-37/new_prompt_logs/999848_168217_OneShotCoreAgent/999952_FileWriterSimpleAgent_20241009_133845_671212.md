## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not explicitly handling hitting swapped-in creatures with queued skills, I'll modify the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. Modify the `resolve_turn` method to handle swapped-in creatures correctly:
   - Execute swap actions first.
   - For each attack action, check if the target has swapped creatures.
   - If a swap occurred, the new creature becomes the target of the attack.

2. Add a method to track which player has swapped their creature during the turn.

3. Update the `execute_skill` method to use the potentially swapped-in creature as the target.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing model structure. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified as it already adheres to the guidelines of being pure data schemas without methods or properties.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

    def on_exit(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `swapped_players` list to track which players have swapped their creatures during the turn.
2. Modifying the `resolve_turn` method to execute swap actions first, then attack actions.
3. Updating the `execute_skill` method to check if the target has swapped creatures and provide appropriate feedback.

These changes ensure that swapped-in creatures are hit by queued skills as required by the architecture documentation. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll focus on modifying the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix each issue:

1. Implement an explicit queue for actions:
   - Create a new attribute `action_queue` in the `MainGameScene` class to store the actions.
   - Modify the turn methods to add actions to the queue instead of returning them directly.
   - Update the `resolve_turn` method to process actions from the queue.

2. Move the reset of creatures to when leaving the scene:
   - Add a new method `on_exit` that will be called when leaving the scene.
   - Move the `reset_creatures` call to this new method.
   - Ensure this method is called before transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing model structure.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. Implemented an explicit queue for actions (`action_queue`) as described in the architecture.
2. Modified the turn methods to add actions to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. Updated the `resolve_turn` method to process actions from the queue.
4. Added an `on_exit` method that resets the creatures' state when leaving the scene.
5. Ensured that `on_exit` is called before quitting the game in the `end_battle` method.

These changes maintain the existing model structure and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified, as it already adheres to the guidelines of being pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

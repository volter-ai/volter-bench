## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the test failures, we need to focus on two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the `choose_swap` method is being called with no available creatures, leading to an empty choices list.
2. The `MainGameScene` is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `bot_turn` method to check if there are available creatures before calling `choose_swap`. If there are no available creatures, we'll default to choosing an attack.

2. We'll update the `battle_loop` method to properly handle the end of the battle by calling `quit_whole_game` when the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: b9fbd6a0-90bd-4124-be68-fc91e68b2ee7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `bot_turn` method to check for available creatures before deciding to swap, preventing the empty choices list issue.
2. Updating the `battle_loop` method to call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, ensuring the scene terminates properly.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be changed, as it already adheres to the guidelines of being pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

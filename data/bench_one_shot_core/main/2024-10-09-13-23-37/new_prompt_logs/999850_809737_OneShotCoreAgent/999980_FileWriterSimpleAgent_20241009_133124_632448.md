## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The random test runs are not completing as expected, indicating that the game loop might be terminating prematurely.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` instead of just ending the scene.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit is called.
3. We'll add a turn counter to prevent infinite loops in case of a stalemate.

Here's the proposed solution for the `MainGameScene`:

        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.max_turns = 50  # Prevent infinite loops

```

These changes should address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the scene always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. Adding a turn counter to prevent infinite loops in case of a stalemate.
3. Maintaining the game loop structure until a transition or quit is called.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas inheriting from the appropriate base classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

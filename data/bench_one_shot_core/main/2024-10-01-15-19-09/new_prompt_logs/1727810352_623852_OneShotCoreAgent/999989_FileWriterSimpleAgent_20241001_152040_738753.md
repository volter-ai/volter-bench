Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError in the MainGameScene class. The error occurs because the method `_player_choice_phase()` is missing. This method should handle the player's choice of skill during the battle.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add the missing `_player_choice_phase()` method to the MainGameScene class.
2. We'll also add the missing `_bot_choice_phase()` method, which was referenced but not implemented.
3. We'll ensure that these methods use the `_wait_for_choice()` method to get input from both the player and the bot.
4. We'll make sure that the methods return a Skill object, which will be used in the resolution phase.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 6bde462a-203e-4896-9af6-93473ea1c24f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Bot: {self.bot.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.bot_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp})"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self._show_text(self.bot, str(self))

            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            bot_skill = self._bot_choice_phase()

            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _bot_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name} and dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Bot used {bot_skill.display_name} and dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the following:

1. We've added the `_player_choice_phase()` method, which was missing and causing the AttributeError.
2. We've also added the `_bot_choice_phase()` method to handle the bot's skill selection.
3. Both methods use `SelectThing` to create choices for skills, which is more appropriate for selecting game objects than using `Button`.
4. The methods return Skill objects, which are then used in the `_resolution_phase()`.
5. We've updated the type hints to clearly indicate that Skill objects are being passed around.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the game to run properly. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation between models and game logic.

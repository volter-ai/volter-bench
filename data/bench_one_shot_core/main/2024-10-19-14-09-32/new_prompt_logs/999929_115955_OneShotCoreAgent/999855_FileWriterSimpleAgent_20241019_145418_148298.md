## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle is ending without properly transitioning or quitting the game.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the `_check_battle_end` method not only checks for the end condition but also handles the transition.
3. We'll add a "Return to Main Menu" option after the battle ends.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow of the game.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to include an `_end_battle` method call after the battle ends.
3. Implementing the `_end_battle` method to show a "Return to Main Menu" option and handle the transition back to the main menu.
4. Ensuring that the `_check_battle_end` method only checks for the end condition without handling the transition.

These modifications ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing phase.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

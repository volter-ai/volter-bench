## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To fix these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase for both 'Attack' and 'Swap' choices.
2. Modify the resolution phase to handle random order if creatures have tied speed.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. Add a 'Back' button to both the attack and swap choice menus.
2. Implement a loop in the player_choice_phase to allow going back to the main choice.
3. Modify the resolution_phase to use random.shuffle when speeds are tied.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the 'Attack' and 'Swap' choices. Players can go back to the main choice menu if they change their minds.
2. The resolution phase now handles random order if creatures have tied speed by shuffling the actions list before sorting by speed.

The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until the battle ends, and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 6eae87d1-cb85-4d0a-8272-05b7e61f9fd3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        self.reset_creatures()
        self.return_to_main_menu()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the game loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Ensuring that `check_battle_end` returns a boolean value.
4. Adding a `return_to_main_menu` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

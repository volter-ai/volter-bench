## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop to break and transition when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle, so the game can be played multiple times.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 731e6d19-e967-4c8a-ae02-bb20dc553d41
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.game_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()  # Reset creatures for potential future battles
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill = choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.opponent_skill = choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0])
        if second[0].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0])

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends in the `run` method.
2. Breaking the game loop when `check_battle_end` returns True, which happens when either creature's HP reaches 0.
3. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP to their maximum values after each battle.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly and allows for multiple playthroughs without needing to restart the entire application. The game will now transition back to the main menu after each battle, allowing the player to start a new battle or quit the game.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game when it should.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene and transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended and return a boolean.
2. In the main game loop, we'll check if the battle has ended after each turn.
3. If the battle has ended, we'll show the result message and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 56c298a3-8db1-472d-89ca-c5ffcf7d2ceb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._is_battle_ended():
                self._show_battle_result()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self._is_battle_ended():
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self._is_battle_ended():
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        effectiveness = "It's super effective!" if weakness_factor > 1 else "It's not very effective..." if weakness_factor < 1 else ""
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _is_battle_ended(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Introducing an `_is_battle_ended()` method to check if either creature's HP has reached 0.
2. Checking if the battle has ended after each turn in the main game loop.
3. When the battle ends, showing the result message and transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes ensure that the scene properly exits and transitions when the battle is over, resolving both the assertion error in the test and the FixableException in the whole game flow test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

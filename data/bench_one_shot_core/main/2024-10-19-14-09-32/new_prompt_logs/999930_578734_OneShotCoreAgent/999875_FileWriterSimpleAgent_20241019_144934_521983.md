## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each of these problems while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Modify the Resolution Phase to handle random action order for creatures with the same speed.
3. Add a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.

To implement these fixes, we'll need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 56b21518-cdb8-41b1-b2ac-3ce5e698ce1e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent.active_creature.hp}/{self.opponent.active_creature.max_hp})

        return True
```

This solution addresses all the issues raised:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main action selection.
2. The `resolution_phase` method now handles random action order for creatures with the same speed by using `random.random()` as a tiebreaker.
3. A `reset_creatures_state` method has been added and is called when leaving the MainGameScene, resetting the HP of all player creatures to their maximum values.

These changes ensure that the game follows the described architecture more closely while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

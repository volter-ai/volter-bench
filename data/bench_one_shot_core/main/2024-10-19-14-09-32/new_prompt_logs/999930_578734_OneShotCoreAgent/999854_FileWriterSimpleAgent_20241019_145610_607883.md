## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method `from_prototype_id` to the `Player` class, which violates the rule that models should be pure data schemas without methods. To fix this, we need to remove the `from_prototype_id` method from the `Player` class and handle the initialization of the `active_creature` in the `App` class instead.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` method from the `Player` class in `models.py`.
2. Update the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in `main.py` to set the `active_creature` after creating the player instance.

Let's rewrite the necessary files:

# Excerpt ID: c70c65cc-fc9c-4c7c-bf6c-8bcb92e5eb11
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

# Excerpt ID: e75dea94-52f1-490f-bd2e-ed35bac9347e
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player
import uuid

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_from_game_database("default_player", Player)
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_from_game_database(prototype_id, Player)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Removing the `from_prototype_id` method from the `Player` class, making it a pure data schema.
2. Using the `create_from_game_database` function in the `App` class to create player instances.
3. Setting the `active_creature` in the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods of the `App` class.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the pure data schema nature of the models. It also adheres to the guideline of having all models inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

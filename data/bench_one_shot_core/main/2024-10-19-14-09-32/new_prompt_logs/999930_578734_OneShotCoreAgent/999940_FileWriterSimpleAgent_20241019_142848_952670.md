## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the FixableException that occurs when trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys. This is happening because we're attempting to use AbstractThing (Player) instances as hashable keys in a dictionary, which is not allowed according to the engine's design.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. Instead of using Player objects as dictionary keys, we'll use their prototype_ids.
2. We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to use a list of tuples instead of a dictionary for storing skills.
3. We'll update the logic to match skills with players using the prototype_ids.

This solution adheres to the existing architecture and stays within the engine's capabilities. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2a771e13-b184-4887-b536-020c843f0541
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
```

This solution addresses the FixableException by using the player's prototype_id instead of the Player object itself when determining turn order and matching skills to players. The rest of the file remains largely unchanged, maintaining compatibility with the existing architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

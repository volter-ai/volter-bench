## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of lacking explicit queue management for skill execution in the resolution phase, I'll modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Add a queue to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. Modify the player_choice_phase and foe_choice_phase methods to add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them.
3. Update the resolution_phase method to process skills from the queue.

This approach aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require changes to the models, as the queue management will be handled within the scene logic.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d5503221-729f-478e-9d6d-f887f290e5e6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end condition
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, self.player_creature, skill_choice.thing))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, attacker_creature, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation introduces a `skill_queue` using a `deque` to manage the skills chosen by both players. The `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods now add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them. The `resolution_phase` method processes skills from the queue, executing them in the order they were added. This approach aligns with the described architecture and addresses the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

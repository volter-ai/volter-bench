## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a check in the `run` method of `MainGameScene` to break the loop when the battle ends.
3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and the game flow continues as expected.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b82ccc70-7f0a-4bcd-820e-c54dfd1923d7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name}:

        new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing
        self._perform_swap(player, new_creature)
        return True
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the battle loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
4. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by transitioning to another scene when the battle is over, addressing both issues raised in the test failures. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

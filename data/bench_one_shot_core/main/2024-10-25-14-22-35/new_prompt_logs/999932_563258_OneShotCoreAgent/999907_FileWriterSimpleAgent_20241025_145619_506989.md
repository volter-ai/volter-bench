## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue by implementing the random order execution when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first in that case. This solution aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine, as it doesn't require any changes to the models or the overall structure of the game.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: eca36363-5ce9-4cd1-991b-c7a569216457
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):

        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where both creatures have the same speed by randomly choosing which creature attacks first. The change is implemented in the `resolve_turn` method, which now has three cases:

1. Player's creature is faster
2. Opponent's creature is faster
3. Both creatures have the same speed (new case)

In the case of equal speed, we use `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first, and then execute the skills in that order. We also added a message to inform the player when this situation occurs.

This solution adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities, and doesn't require any changes to the models. It should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures after the battle ends, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` in the `MainGameScene` class.
2. This method will reset the HP of both the player's and bot's creatures to their maximum HP.
3. We'll call this method at the end of the battle, just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture guidelines. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already correctly defined as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6a077c9c-cbf4-42f8-b6d8-87b081668b21
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Opponent's turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.bot_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Player's skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}! It dealt {player_skill.damage} damage.")
        
        # Bot's skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {bot_skill.display_name}! It dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage.")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "Creatures' health has been restored.")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by resetting the state of both the player's and bot's creatures after the battle ends. The `_reset_creatures_state()` method is called just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`, ensuring that the creatures' HP is restored to their maximum values for the next battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning back to MainMenuScene or calling quit_whole_game.

According to the engine architecture:
- Scenes must always end with either a transition or quit
- We should return to MainMenuScene after a battle ends
- The scene's game loop should continue until an explicit transition/quit

Solution:
I'll modify MainGameScene to:
1. Keep the game loop running until explicitly broken by transition/quit
2. Add proper scene transitions after battle end
3. Maintain all existing battle logic but ensure proper scene flow

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes made:
1. Removed the separate check_battle_end() method and integrated it directly into the main game loop
2. Added proper scene transitions using _transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") when the battle ends
3. Removed the return statement that was causing the scene to end improperly
4. Kept the game loop running until an explicit transition occurs

The scene now properly transitions back to the main menu when the battle ends, following the engine's architecture requirements for scene flow control.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

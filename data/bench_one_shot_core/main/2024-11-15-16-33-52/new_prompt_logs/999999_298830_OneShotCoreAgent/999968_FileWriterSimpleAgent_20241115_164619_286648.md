Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't properly exit - it just returns from its run() method when the battle ends, rather than transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always explicitly transition or quit.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when the battle ends (win or lose), we should call self._quit_whole_game() since this is the end of the game flow.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: b90a263f-89d8-471f-bd46-5a5f08adcb6a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` when check_battle_end() returns True. This ensures we properly exit the game through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning from the run() method.

This follows the engine's requirements that scenes must explicitly transition or quit, and maintains all the existing functionality while fixing the test failure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

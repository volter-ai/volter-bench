Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just returns from the run() method when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When a battle ends (win or lose), transition back to MainMenuScene
2. This gives the player a chance to play again or quit
3. Keep the same pattern of showing text before transitioning

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 47628b24-ebe5-4d0f-a2e5-d136bd5ad9b9

        # Set initial active creatures

    def get_action_order(self, player_action, bot_action):
        if self.player.active_creature.speed > self.bot.active_creature.speed:

    def check_battle_end(self):

        bot_has_healthy = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.bot.creatures)
        
        if not player_has_healthy:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            # Reset creature HP before returning to menu
            for creature in self.player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            for creature in self.bot.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            return True
        elif not bot_has_healthy:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            # Reset creature HP before returning to menu
            for creature in self.player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            for creature in self.bot.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. When battle ends, we now transition back to MainMenuScene instead of returning
2. We reset creature HP before transitioning
3. All paths now properly end in either a transition or quit (via MainMenuScene)

This maintains the engine's requirements while keeping the game loop intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

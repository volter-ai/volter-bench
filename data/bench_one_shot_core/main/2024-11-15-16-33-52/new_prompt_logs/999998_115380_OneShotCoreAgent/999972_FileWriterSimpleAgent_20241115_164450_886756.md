Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because in MainGameScene's get_player_action(), we return None when there are no available creatures to swap to. This causes the run() method to return directly without transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, we must always end a scene with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()`
- `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix:
1. Never return None from get_player_action()
2. Instead, if there are no creatures to swap to, show that information and return to the main action choice
3. Keep the battle loop going until we explicitly transition or quit
4. Make sure all paths end in a proper transition or quit

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Removed all direct returns from get_player_action()
2. Added a while True loop in get_player_action() to handle "Back" functionality
3. Added proper messaging when no creatures are available to swap
4. Made sure all paths lead to either transition_to_scene or quit_whole_game
5. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection
6. Added feedback messages for creature swaps

This maintains the engine's requirements while improving the user experience and fixing the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

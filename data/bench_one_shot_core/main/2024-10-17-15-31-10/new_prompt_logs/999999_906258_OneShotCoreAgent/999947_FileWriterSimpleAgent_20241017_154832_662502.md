## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the damage calculation in the MainGameScene.

1. To fix the issue:
   - We'll modify the `_execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class to use floats for intermediate calculations in the damage formula.
   - We'll only convert the final damage to an integer at the end of the calculation.
   - This change will ensure compliance with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c9218476-4ce9-49ee-b669-9b0f529c4e7f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():

        return choice.thing

    def _foe_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        # Use floats for intermediate calculations
        raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender_creature.defense)
        factor = self._get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)  # Convert to int only at the end
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")

    def _get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation ensures that floats are used for intermediate calculations in the damage formula, as specified in the architecture. The final damage is only converted to an integer at the end of the calculation. This change should resolve the discrepancy noted in the QA pass while maintaining compliance with the design and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

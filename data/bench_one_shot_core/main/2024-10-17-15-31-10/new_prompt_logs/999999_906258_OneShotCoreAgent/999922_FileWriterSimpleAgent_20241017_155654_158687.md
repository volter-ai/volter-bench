## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the missing implementation of random order for skill execution when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `_resolve_turns` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll implement the solution:

   a. Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   b. If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   c. Execute the skills in the determined order.

This solution adheres to the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as we're only modifying the game logic within the scene.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f6bb5722-aa06-4d40-8514-7222760b21c6

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining which creature goes first. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, and we've maintained the structure of the `MainGameScene` class while addressing the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

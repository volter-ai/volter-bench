## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the `run` method, we'll add a condition to break the loop when the battle ends.
3. After the battle loop, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a21be591-1962-42ab-bcc5-7e2dc751bdb3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Transition back to MainMenuScene after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self._get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses both issues:

1. The `_check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean, which is used in the `run` method to break the battle loop when the battle ends.
2. After the battle loop ends, we transition back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These changes ensure that the scene exits properly and transitions to another scene after the battle ends, which should resolve the test failures and the FixableException that was being raised.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that we're not resetting the creature state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, as specified in the documentation. To fix this, we need to modify the MainGameScene class to reset the creatures' HP before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll move the `reset_creatures` method call to just before we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll ensure this reset happens both when the battle ends normally and when it reaches a stalemate.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b75d8405-e43f-486c-ac7d-c708b9355519
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.max_turns = 20  # Add a maximum number of turns to prevent infinite loops

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"A wild {self.player_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        turn_count = 0
        while turn_count < self.max_turns:
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                return
            
            turn_count += 1

        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has reached a stalemate!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "The battle has reached a stalemate!")
        self.end_battle()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - opponent_skill.damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent dealt {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Resetting creatures and returning to main menu...")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Resetting creatures and returning to main menu...")
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation ensures that the creatures' HP is reset before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. The `reset_creatures` method is now called in the `end_battle` method, which is invoked both when the battle ends normally and when it reaches a stalemate. This change aligns with the specified architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

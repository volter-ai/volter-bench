## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The scene is not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of its execution, which is causing the FixableException.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll display the battle result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll call this method when we detect that the battle has ended in the main game loop.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ad8f02ce-c901-4561-8f7c-03cc3cb62ef7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turns
            self._resolve_turns(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def _opponent_turn(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turns(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
        
        self._reset_creatures()
        
        # Add a button to return to the main menu
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        
        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `_end_battle` method that handles the end of the battle, displays the result, and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
2. Modifying the main game loop to call `_end_battle` when the battle ends, which ensures that the scene always exits properly.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to return to the MainMenuScene, which resolves the FixableException issue.

These modifications should fix the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene properly handles the end of battles and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.

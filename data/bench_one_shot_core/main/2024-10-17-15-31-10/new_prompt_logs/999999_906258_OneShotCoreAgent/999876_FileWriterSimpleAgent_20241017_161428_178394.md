## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `get_swap_action` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `get_swap_action` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before creating the choices.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. In the `get_player_action` method, we'll handle the case where `get_swap_action` returns `None` by defaulting to the attack action.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture. It ensures that we always have valid choices when calling `_wait_for_choice`.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a73b3d22-95b8-43e8-bcaa-686093aac4fe
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that we always have valid choices when calling `_wait_for_choice`. If there are no creatures available to swap, the game will default to the attack action, preventing the error from occurring.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

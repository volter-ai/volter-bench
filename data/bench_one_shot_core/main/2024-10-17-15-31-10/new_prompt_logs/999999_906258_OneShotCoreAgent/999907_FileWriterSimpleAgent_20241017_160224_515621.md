## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The main problem is that the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends. We'll address this by adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, instead of just returning True when the battle ends, we'll transition to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll remove the `while True` loop from the `run` method and instead use a single iteration of the battle loop.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP at the start of each battle.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 7aa78f33-beab-4711-b1f1-1656a90a0ba7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.reset_creatures()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        while not self.check_battle_end():

            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button])

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):

        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. The `check_battle_end` method now transitions to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene exits properly.
2. The `run` method now uses a `while` loop that continues until `check_battle_end` returns `True`, which happens when the battle is over and we transition to the `MainMenuScene`.
3. We've added a `reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of both creatures at the start of each battle, and we call this method at the beginning of the `run` method.

These modifications should fix the test failures by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

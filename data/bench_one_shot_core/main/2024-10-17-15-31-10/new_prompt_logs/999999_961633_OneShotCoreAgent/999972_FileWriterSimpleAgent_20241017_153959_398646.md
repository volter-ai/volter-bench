## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:
To implement the random order logic for skill execution when creatures have the same speed, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of always executing the player's skill first when speeds are equal, we'll introduce a random factor to determine the order.

Here's how we'll fix it:
- In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll check if the speeds are equal.
- If they are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
- We'll then execute the skills in the randomly determined order.

This change will ensure that when creatures have the same speed, the order of skill execution is randomized, as specified in the architecture document.

2. Rewritten file with the proposed solution:

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated `main_game_scene.py` file now correctly implements the random order logic for skill execution when creatures have the same speed. The `resolution_phase` method has been modified to use `random.choice()` to determine the order of skill execution when the speeds are equal. This change ensures that the game follows the specified architecture and adds an element of randomness to battles when creatures have the same speed.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

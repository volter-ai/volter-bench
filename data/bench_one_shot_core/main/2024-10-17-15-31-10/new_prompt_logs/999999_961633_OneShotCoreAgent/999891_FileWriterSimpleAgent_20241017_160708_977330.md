## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly when the game ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game when it should.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to properly exit the game loop when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a call to `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, signaling that the game has finished.
3. We'll ensure that the `run` method of `MainGameScene` has a proper game loop that continues until the battle ends.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the current architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as the issue is with the scene logic.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7f7fb050-19d6-4ef4-96f6-e555bcdf79e3

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.initialize_battle()
        self.battle_ended = False

    def initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{player.display_name} has no more creatures available!")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the game loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Adding a call to `self._quit_whole_game()` at the end of the `run` method to properly signal that the game has ended.
4. Updating the `check_battle_end` method to set `battle_ended` to True when the battle is over.

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing. The scene will now properly exit when the battle ends, and it will call `_quit_whole_game()` to signal that the game has finished. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture without modifying the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' in the App class. The error occurs because we haven't imported the necessary scene classes in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll import both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene at the top of the main.py file.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary imports are present and correctly ordered.

Here's the rewritten main.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1c3ee5ed-2365-47bc-b407-f91e6655767e
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # Set the active_creature to the first creature in the list
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the architecture of the game. By importing the necessary scene classes, we resolve the NameError and ensure that the App class can properly register and use these scenes.

The changes made are:
1. Added import statements for MainMenuScene and MainGameScene at the top of the file.
2. Kept the existing structure of the App class and its methods.
3. Maintained the data schema nature of the models by not modifying the Player or Creature classes.

These changes should resolve the NameError and allow the tests to run without this particular error. The App class can now correctly reference and register both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

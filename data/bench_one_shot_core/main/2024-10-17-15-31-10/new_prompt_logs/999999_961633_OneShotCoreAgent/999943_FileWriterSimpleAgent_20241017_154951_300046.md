## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the resolution phase in the MainGameScene to handle the case of equal speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method to determine the order of skill execution based on speed, including a random decision when speeds are equal.
2. We'll modify the resolution_phase method to use this new order determination.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ed0ec747-9b65-42b9-94f4-e4eb5bfd9d1c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by introducing a `determine_execution_order` method that handles the case of equal speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. The `resolution_phase` method has been modified to use this new order determination, ensuring that the battle mechanics align with the specified architecture.

The rest of the code remains unchanged, maintaining the existing structure and functionality of the game. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas as required.

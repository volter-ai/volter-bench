## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the problem of using AbstractThing objects (specifically Player objects) as dictionary keys. This is causing a FixableException because AbstractThing objects are not hashable. Instead, we should use the prototype_id of the Player objects as dictionary keys.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the resolution_phase method to use the player's prototype_id as the dictionary key instead of the player object itself.
2. We'll update the execute_skill method to work with the player's prototype_id instead of the player object.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by using the player's prototype_id as the dictionary key instead of the player object itself. The `determine_execution_order` method now returns a list of tuples containing the player's prototype_id and creature, and the `resolution_phase` and `execute_skill` methods have been updated to work with these prototype_ids.

These changes should resolve the FixableException while maintaining the existing structure and functionality of the game. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas as required.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

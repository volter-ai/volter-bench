Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how the MainMenuScene test handles scene transitions and quits.

We need to:
1. Mock the _quit_whole_game method like we do in the MainMenuScene test
2. Create a custom exception to catch when the game quits
3. Properly handle all exit conditions in the test

The solution stays within the engine's capabilities and doesn't require changes to the models or core architecture.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 0462c124-1feb-4aaa-90dc-73bd9b9cff77
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class GameEnd(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_game(*args, **kwargs):
                raise GameEnd()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game', side_effect=exit_game) as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except GameEnd:
                    print(f"Game ended normally in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode completed run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game did not end properly"
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for game end conditions
2. Added mocking of _quit_whole_game method
3. Added custom GameEnd exception to catch when the game ends
4. Added assertions to verify the game ends properly
5. Added cleanup in finally block

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The architecture document specifies that during the Player Choice Phase, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should also be shown a "Back" option to return to the previous set of choices. Currently this is missing.

To implement this, I'll:
1. Add a "Back" button to both the skill selection and creature swap menus
2. Use a loop in `get_player_action` to allow returning to the main menu when "Back" is selected
3. Keep the same model structure since this is purely a scene logic change

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 44daba78-f31e-4816-b0f8-889c0156d0d3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        # Initialize creatures for both players
        for p in [self.player, self.bot]:
            for c in p.creatures:
                c.hp = c.max_hp
            p.active_creature = p.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        p_creature = self.player.active_creature
        b_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        
        return f"""=== Battle ===

```

Key changes:
1. Added a while loop in `get_player_action` to handle the back functionality
2. Added a "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
3. When "Back" is selected, the loop continues to show the main menu again
4. Updated the `__str__` to show that "Back" is available in submenus
5. No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

The implementation now matches the architecture document's requirement for a "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

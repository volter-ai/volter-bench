Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid choices available. This happens in `get_player_action` when creating `creature_choices` - if all creatures are either knocked out or are the active creature, the list will be empty.

The fix needs to:
1. Check if there are any valid swap choices before offering the swap option
2. Only show "Swap" as a choice if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Stay within the engine's capabilities by using the existing choice system

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `get_available_creatures` helper method to check for valid swap targets
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show the Swap option if there are available creatures
3. Updated the scene's `__str__` to indicate that Swap is conditional
4. The swap logic in `check_battle_end` was already correct since it checks for available creatures before offering choices

This should fix the empty choices error while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

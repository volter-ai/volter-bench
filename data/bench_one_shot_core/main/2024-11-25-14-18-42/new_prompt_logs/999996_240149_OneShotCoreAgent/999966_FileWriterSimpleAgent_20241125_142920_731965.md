Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that the battle resolution phase doesn't handle equal speed cases as specified in the architecture document. According to the docs:

"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

To fix this, we need to modify the `_resolve_turn` method in MainGameScene to:
1. Check if speeds are equal
2. If equal, use random.random() to give each creature a 50% chance of going first
3. Otherwise use the existing speed comparison logic

This change only requires modifying the MainGameScene class since it's a logic change, not a data model change.

2. Here's the complete fixed file:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are in the `_resolve_turn` method:
1. Added explicit check for equal speeds using `if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed`
2. When speeds are equal, use `random.random() < 0.5` to give each creature a 50% chance of going first
3. Maintained the existing logic for cases where speeds differ
4. Kept the same skill execution logic after turn order is determined

This change fully implements the battle system as specified in the architecture document while maintaining clean separation between data and logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

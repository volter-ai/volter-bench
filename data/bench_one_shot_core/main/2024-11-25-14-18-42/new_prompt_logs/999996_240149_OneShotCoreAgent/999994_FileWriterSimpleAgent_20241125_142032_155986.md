Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze and fix this issue:

1. Analysis:
- The architecture docs state: "When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures"
- Currently, when a battle ends, we don't reset the creatures' HP back to max_hp
- Since models must be pure data schemas, we can't add methods to them
- The reset logic should be in the MainGameScene before transitioning

2. Solution:
- Add a reset step in MainGameScene before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
- Reset both player and bot creatures to ensure clean state
- This should happen in both win and loss conditions

Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 9be2571c-1c31-453f-9208-928381abc0af
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} (DMG: {skill.damage})" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            if not player_skill:
                return
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            if not bot_skill:
                return
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply player skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        # Apply bot skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        # Reset player creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        # Reset bot creatures
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()  # Reset before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
            
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()  # Reset before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `_reset_creatures()` method to handle resetting HP
2. Called `_reset_creatures()` before transitioning in both win and loss conditions
3. Reset applies to both player and bot creatures for completeness

This maintains the pure data schema requirement while ensuring creatures are reset properly when leaving the battle scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how we handle it in the main_menu_scene test.

We need to:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
2. Mock the quit_whole_game method like we do in main_menu_scene test
3. Add proper assertions to verify the scene ended correctly

This follows the engine architecture because:
- We're properly handling the engine's expected exit conditions
- We're using the same pattern as the menu scene test
- We maintain the separation between models and game logic

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ad85a466-ef69-4d5d-b42d-9030313aa1be
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode completed run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    # Assert that the scene ended by calling quit_whole_game
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Scene did not end with _quit_whole_game"
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added mock for _quit_whole_game
3. Added catch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
4. Added assertion to verify proper scene ending
5. Added cleanup in finally block

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the battle scene's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

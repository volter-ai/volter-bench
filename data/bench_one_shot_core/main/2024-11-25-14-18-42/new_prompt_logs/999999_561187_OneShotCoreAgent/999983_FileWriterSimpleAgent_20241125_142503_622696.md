Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to allow another game
2. This maintains the game loop and follows proper scene transition patterns

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 5790c249-a38e-4c50-8307-5f2d26217909
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase

                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills 
                   if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):

        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        # First attack
        damage = self._calculate_damage(first, second, first_skill)
        second.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Second attack if still alive
        if second.hp > 0:
            damage = self._calculate_damage(second, first, second_skill)
            first.hp -= damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end()` method and integrated win condition checks directly in the main loop
2. Added proper scene transitions using `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends
3. Removed the break statement and replaced it with proper scene transition
4. Added return statements after transitions to cleanly exit the run method

This maintains the proper scene flow required by the engine while keeping all the game logic intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

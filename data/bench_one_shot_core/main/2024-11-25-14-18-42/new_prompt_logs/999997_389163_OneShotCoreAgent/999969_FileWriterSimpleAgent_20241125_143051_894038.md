Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to show creature swap choices but the list is empty. This happens in MainGameScene when:
- The player chooses "Swap" but there are no valid creatures to swap to
- OR when a creature faints but there are no valid creatures to swap to

The issue is that we're not handling these edge cases properly. We should:
1. Only show the "Swap" button if there are available creatures to swap to
2. When handling fainted creatures, we need to check if there are available creatures BEFORE trying to show choices

This requires modifying the MainGameScene.py file to add these checks.

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

```

Key changes:
1. Modified `__str__` to only show "Swap" option if there are available creatures
2. Modified `run()` to only add the "Swap" button if there are available creatures
3. Moved the available_creatures check before creating choices to ensure we never try to create an empty choice list

This maintains the architecture and engine capabilities while fixing the empty choices issue. The models remain pure data schemas and all game logic stays within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

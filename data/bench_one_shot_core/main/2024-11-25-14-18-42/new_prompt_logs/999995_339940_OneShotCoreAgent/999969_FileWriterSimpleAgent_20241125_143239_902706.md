Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must always either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just returns from the run() method when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. After a battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene
2. This maintains the game loop and follows proper scene transition patterns
3. No changes needed to models since this is purely a scene flow issue

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when:
   - A player has no more creatures available
   - The battle ends with a winner
2. This ensures the scene always transitions properly rather than just returning
3. The transition returns the player to the main menu where they can choose to play again or quit

The rest of the battle logic remains unchanged since it was working correctly. This fix ensures proper scene flow according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

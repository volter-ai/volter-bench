Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene terminates without properly signaling game end through either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. When the battle ends (either in victory or defeat), we're just returning from the run method instead of properly transitioning.

The fix is to:
- After showing the victory/defeat message, transition back to MainMenuScene
- This maintains proper scene flow and follows engine requirements
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Changed the return statements to continue in the main game loop when actions are None
2. Added proper scene transition after battle end
3. Maintained all the existing battle logic and functionality

This should resolve the FixableException while keeping the game working as intended.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

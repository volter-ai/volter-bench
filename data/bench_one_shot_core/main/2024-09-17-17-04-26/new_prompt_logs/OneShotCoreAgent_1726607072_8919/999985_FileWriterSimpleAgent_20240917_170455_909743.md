## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The `MainGameScene` is terminating without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which is causing a `FixableException`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns `True` when the battle is over, allowing the main game loop to exit.
3. We'll add a transition to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already correct pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9ee17259-85f1-41eb-9236-95bea369245b

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to exit the loop when the battle ends.
3. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve both the test failure in `test_main_game_scene.py` and the `FixableException` in `test_whole_game.py`. The scene now properly exits by transitioning to another scene, adhering to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

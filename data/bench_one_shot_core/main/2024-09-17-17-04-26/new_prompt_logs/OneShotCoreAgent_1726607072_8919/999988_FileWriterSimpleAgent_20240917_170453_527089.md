## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AssertionError that's being raised when `_wait_for_choice` is called with no choices. This is happening in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when there are no available creatures to swap to, which can happen if all creatures except the active one have zero HP.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `choose_swap` method in the `MainGameScene` class to handle the case where there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None or a special action indicating that no swap is possible.
3. We'll update the `player_turn` method to handle this special case and choose a different action if swapping is not possible.

Here's the proposed solution:

        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

        elif all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.bot.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution makes the following changes:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we now return `None` if there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. In the `player_turn` method, we now handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None`. If this happens, we show a message to the player and default to choosing an attack instead.

These changes should resolve the AssertionError we were seeing. The `_wait_for_choice` method will now only be called when there are actually choices available. If there are no creatures available to swap to, the game will automatically choose to attack instead.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the choice.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None instead of trying to offer an empty list of choices.
3. We'll update the `player_turn` and `bot_turn` methods to handle the case where `choose_swap` returns None.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `choose_swap` method to return `None` if there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. Updating the `player_turn` method to handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None` by showing a message to the player and allowing them to choose again.
3. Updating the `bot_turn` method to fall back to choosing an attack if there are no available creatures to swap to.

These changes should resolve the `AssertionError` that was occurring when `_wait_for_choice` was called with an empty list of choices. The game should now handle situations where a player or bot has no creatures available to swap to, allowing the game to continue without crashing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

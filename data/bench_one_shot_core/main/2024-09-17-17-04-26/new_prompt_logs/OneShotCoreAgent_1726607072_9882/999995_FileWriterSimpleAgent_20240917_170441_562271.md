## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError in the `_determine_order` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because `player_skill` and `foe_skill` are not defined in this method. We should modify the method to accept these skills as parameters.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Update the `_determine_order` method signature to accept `player_skill` and `foe_skill` as parameters.
2. Modify the `_resolution_phase` method to pass these skills to `_determine_order`.
3. Update the return statement in `_determine_order` to use the passed skills.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d8e770f7-5117-4ce6-9f03-5c39c2237d41
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, foe, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(foe, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)
        
        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[1], first[2])
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[1], second[2])

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.foe, self.foe_creature, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.foe, self.foe_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.foe, self.foe_creature, skill2)
            else:
                return (self.foe, self.foe_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution should resolve the NameError by properly passing the `player_skill` and `foe_skill` to the `_determine_order` method. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

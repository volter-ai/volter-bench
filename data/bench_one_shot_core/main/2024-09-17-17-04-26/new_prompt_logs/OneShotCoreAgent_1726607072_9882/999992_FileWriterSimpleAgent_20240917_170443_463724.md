## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game flow is not complete, as it doesn't return to the main menu or quit the game after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll add a transition back to the main menu after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in `MainGameScene` continues until the battle is over.
3. We'll add a method to transition back to the main menu.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We won't need to modify the models, as they are already pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0ff20748-aec7-4300-ab2d-f9225ebdbe7b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()
        
        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player, creature):

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)
        
        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[1], first[2])
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[1], second[2])

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.foe, self.foe_creature, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.foe, self.foe_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop continues until the battle ends.
2. Adding a transition back to the main menu after the battle ends.
3. Keeping the existing structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow is complete, transitioning back to the main menu after each battle. The models remain unchanged, maintaining their status as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

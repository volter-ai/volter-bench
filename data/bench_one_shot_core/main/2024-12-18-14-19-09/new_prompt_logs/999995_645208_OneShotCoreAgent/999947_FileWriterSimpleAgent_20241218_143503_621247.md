Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene returns directly when a player wins instead of properly ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always transition to another scene or quit the game - they can't just return.

The fix needs to:
- Call `_quit_whole_game()` when a winner is determined instead of returning
- Keep the game loop running until explicitly ended
- Maintain proper scene transitions

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` when a winner is determined instead of just returning
2. Added return after `_quit_whole_game()` to prevent further execution
3. Maintained the game loop until explicitly ended via `_quit_whole_game()`

This change ensures the scene follows the engine's architecture by properly ending the game through `_quit_whole_game()` rather than just returning.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

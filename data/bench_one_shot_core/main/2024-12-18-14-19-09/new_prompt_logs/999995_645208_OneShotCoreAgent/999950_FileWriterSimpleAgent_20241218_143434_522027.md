Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with an empty list of choices. This happens in `get_player_action` when:
- A player tries to swap but has no valid creatures to swap to
- A player tries to attack but has no valid skills

The fix needs to:
- Always ensure there are valid choices
- Handle cases where creatures are knocked out
- Force creature swaps when active creature is knocked out
- Add a "Back" button for the attack/swap menus

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added force_swap method to handle knocked out creatures
2. Added "Back" button to menus
3. Added proper handling when no swap options are available
4. Improved menu flow with while True loop
5. Removed redundant battle end check since it's handled in force_swap
6. Added proper null checks for action returns

These changes ensure there are always valid choices available and handle all edge cases properly while maintaining the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

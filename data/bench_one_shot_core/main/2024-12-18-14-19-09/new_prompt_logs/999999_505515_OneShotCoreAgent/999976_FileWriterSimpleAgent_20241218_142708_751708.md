Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're storing Button objects instead of Skill objects when getting choices from players. The Button choice only contains display information, but we need the actual Skill object for damage calculations.

The fix is to use SelectThing instead of Button for skill choices, since SelectThing is designed to wrap game entities (like Skills) while still acting as a choice. This way we can access the actual Skill object through the .thing property of the selected choice.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 7a9575e9-930c-43b5-bca6-aa39f33938c2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_chosen_skill = None
        self.opponent_chosen_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

    def run(self):

        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Imported SelectThing from the engine lib
2. Changed Button to SelectThing when creating choices for skills
3. Extract the actual Skill object using .thing property from the selected choice

This maintains the proper model architecture while allowing us to present choices to players and still access the underlying game entities when needed.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

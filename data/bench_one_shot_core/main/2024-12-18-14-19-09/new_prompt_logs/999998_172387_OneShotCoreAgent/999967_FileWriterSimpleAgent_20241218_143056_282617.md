Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where `bot_action` can be None, causing a TypeError when trying to access `action[0]` in the resolve_turn method. This happens because we're not handling the case where get_player_action returns None (which occurs when a player chooses "Back").

The fix should:
1. Ensure bot_action is never None by having the bot always make a valid choice
2. Handle None actions gracefully in resolve_turn
3. Keep the turn loop going if a player chooses "Back"

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 08e0ccf7-27d8-47bd-89b4-8a4406680013

```

Key changes made:
1. Added a while loop in run() to keep asking for player action until valid
2. Made bot always make a valid choice by defaulting to first skill if needed
3. Only show "Back" button to human players
4. Added null checks in resolve_turn when accessing actions
5. Made bot behavior more deterministic by removing "Back" option

These changes maintain the architecture and models while fixing the NoneType error in a way that improves gameplay flow.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainMenuScene test - it's not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when quitting the game. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught in tests.

The test needs to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (which happens when random moves are exhausted) AND _QuitWholeGame (which happens when the quit button is chosen).

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 08f9db3c-6997-46fc-badd-4eb19a13e7bd
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainMenuSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_menu_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 10

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")
```

The key changes are:

1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added a catch-all Exception clause that fails the test if any unexpected exception occurs
4. Added more descriptive print messages to help with debugging

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both expected ways the scene can end:
- Random mode exhaustion (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- Game quit (_QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass since it properly catches both expected exception types.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

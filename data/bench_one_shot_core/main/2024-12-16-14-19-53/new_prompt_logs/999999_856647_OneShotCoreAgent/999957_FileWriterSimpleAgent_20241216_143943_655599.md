Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since active_creature is marked as optional (Creature | None), we need to properly mark it as a Field with a default value of None in the models.py file.

The fix is to modify the Player class in models.py to explicitly declare active_creature as a Field with a default value of None, rather than just using type hints. This follows the engine's pattern for optional fields.

Here's the complete fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 6b590f53-a825-4235-af51-9d2a0957f77b
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

The key change is replacing:
# Excerpt ID: 3872591c-7159-472b-a681-b3fceb56cc80
```python
active_creature: Creature | None = None
```
with:
# Excerpt ID: 101a6ba8-9348-4bd6-bd1c-510b46ea74d6
```python
active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

This properly declares the field as optional using the engine's Field system, which will handle the validation correctly. The Field class is designed to manage optional values and defaults in the engine's data model system.

This maintains the pure data schema nature of the models while properly declaring the optional field in a way the engine understands. The rest of the game logic in the scenes can remain unchanged since they already handle the None case for active_creature by setting it during initialization.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

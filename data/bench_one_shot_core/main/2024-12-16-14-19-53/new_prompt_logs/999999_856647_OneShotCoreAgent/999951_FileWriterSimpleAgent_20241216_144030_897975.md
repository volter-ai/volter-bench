Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because _quit_whole_game() raises an AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception that needs to be caught in the test. Looking at the test output, we can see the game is working correctly (creatures are battling, taking damage, getting knocked out) but the test isn't handling the graceful exit.

The solution is to modify the test file to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions, since both are valid ways for the scene to end during random testing. This matches the engine's architecture where scenes must exit explicitly through these mechanisms.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 0f388122-8122-44a0-820b-c8f10cceb69b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added success message for both types of graceful exit

This maintains the engine's architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Scene logic remains unchanged
- Tests properly handle all valid exit conditions
- The engine's graceful exit mechanisms are respected

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the scene can end during random testing - either through the random mode counter reaching zero or through a natural battle conclusion.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly calling _quit_whole_game() or _transition_to_scene().

According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always explicitly end via one of these methods - we can't just return or break from the game loop. When the battle ends, we should call _quit_whole_game() since this is the final scene.

2. Fix:
We need to modify MainGameScene's check_battle_end() method to call _quit_whole_game() when the battle concludes. Here's the complete fixed scene file:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

        elif not bot_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._quit_whole_game()  # Key change: Properly end the game
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the return True/False from check_battle_end()
2. Added _quit_whole_game() calls when the battle ends
3. Removed the break from the run() loop since check_battle_end() now handles the scene exit

This ensures the scene always exits properly through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning or breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (either win or loss), we just break from the loop instead of properly ending the scene.

According to the engine requirements, a scene must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

Solution:
After the battle ends, we should:
- On win or loss, show the result message
- Then transition back to MainMenuScene to let the player play again or quit
- This maintains the game loop and follows proper scene transition patterns

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: b8e189eb-6d9c-4029-b3e0-ec9d16c56a44
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.opponent_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )

            # Opponent Choice Phase
            self.opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.opponent,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self.determine_order()
            
            # Execute moves
            self.execute_move(first)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_move(second)
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    self.handle_battle_end()
                    return
            else:
                self.handle_battle_end()
                return

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, self.opponent)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.player)
        else:
            return random.choice([(self.player, self.opponent), (self.opponent, self.player)])

    def execute_move(self, acting_player):
        attacker = self.player_creature if acting_player == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        defender = self.opponent_creature if acting_player == self.player else self.player_creature
        skill = attacker.skills[0]  # Since we only have tackle

        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added a `handle_battle_end()` method to properly handle the end of battle
2. Instead of breaking the loop, we now return after calling `handle_battle_end()`
3. `handle_battle_end()` shows the result message and transitions back to MainMenuScene
4. Simplified the battle end check logic into a single method

This maintains proper scene flow control while keeping the same game mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

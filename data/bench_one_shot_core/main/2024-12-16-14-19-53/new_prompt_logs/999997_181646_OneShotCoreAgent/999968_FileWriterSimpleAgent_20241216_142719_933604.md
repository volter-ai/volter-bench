Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught in tests.

The fix is to:
- Update test_main_game_scene.py to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
- This matches how the engine expects graceful termination to be handled
- Keep all other architecture and models the same
- This follows the pattern seen in test_whole_game.py where game termination exceptions are caught

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: a45ea87a-2df0-4576-a7b8-395db8c985de
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed normally, ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game ends normally

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected game termination exception. The test will now pass while still verifying the game scene's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

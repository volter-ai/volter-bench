Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in our test. The error shows an infinite loop between MainGameScene and MainMenuScene, eventually leading to a quit that isn't caught.

The test needs to:
- Mock the transition methods to prevent actual scene transitions
- Catch both transitions and quits properly
- Follow the same pattern as the MainMenuScene test

The solution is to update the MainGameScene test to properly mock transitions and handle both possible exit conditions, just like we do in the MainMenuScene test.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 2a5aa9eb-ae4d-4d7b-a17e-5039a697e7b0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition, ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper mocking of both transition methods
2. Added handling of TransitionFromScene exception
3. Added assertions to verify proper scene exit
4. Added cleanup in finally block
5. Follows same pattern as MainMenuScene test

This ensures that:
- Scene transitions are intercepted and don't cause infinite loops
- Both possible exit conditions (transition and quit) are handled
- The test can properly verify the scene's behavior
- The random testing can complete successfully

The test now properly validates the MainGameScene's behavior without getting stuck in transition loops.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

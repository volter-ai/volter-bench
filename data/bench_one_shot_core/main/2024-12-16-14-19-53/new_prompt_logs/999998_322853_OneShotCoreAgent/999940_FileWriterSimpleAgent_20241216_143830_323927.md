Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to compare the current action with self.player_action, but player_action isn't stored as a class attribute. The issue is that we're not properly tracking which action belongs to which player during the turn resolution.

The fix:
- Store both actions as instance variables when resolving the turn
- Compare the action with the stored actions to determine the attacker/defender
- This maintains separation of concerns and stays within engine capabilities
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Added self.current_player_action and self.current_bot_action as instance variables
2. Modified execute_action to compare against these stored actions
3. Maintained all other functionality and architecture
4. No changes needed to models or other files

This fix properly tracks which action belongs to which player during turn resolution while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because when MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, and MainMenuScene calls quit_whole_game(), the exception isn't being caught in the test. The test should catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame since it's an expected way for the game to end.

The fix is to update the test file to properly catch this exception. This is the correct approach because:
- It maintains the proper scene transition flow (MainGameScene -> MainMenuScene)
- It follows the engine's requirement that scenes must end with transition or quit
- The quit exception is expected behavior that should be handled in tests
- No changes needed to models or scene logic

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7ee10067-3341-43f8-8fd2-dcc2e56dca42
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle needs more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added catch-all handler to fail test on unexpected exceptions
4. Added more descriptive logging for different exit conditions

This maintains all the architectural requirements while properly handling the expected game exit condition in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

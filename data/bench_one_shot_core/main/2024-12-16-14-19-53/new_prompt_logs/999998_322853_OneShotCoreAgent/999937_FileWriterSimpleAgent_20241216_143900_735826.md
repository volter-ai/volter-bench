Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene's check_battle_end() method just returns True when the battle ends, which causes the scene to terminate without properly signaling the end of the game. According to the error message and engine requirements, we must either:
- Transition to another scene, or
- Call quit_whole_game

Since this is the end of the battle and there's no other scene to go to, we should call quit_whole_game() when the battle ends. This follows the engine's architecture requirements and properly signals game termination.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        player_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures)
        bot_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.bot.creatures)
        
        if not player_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")

        elif not bot_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Modified the run() method to call self._quit_whole_game() when check_battle_end() returns True
2. This ensures proper game termination through the engine's mechanisms
3. No changes needed to models or other files since this was purely a scene flow issue
4. Maintains all existing game logic and architecture

This fix properly signals game termination to the engine while staying within its capabilities and maintaining clean separation of concerns.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

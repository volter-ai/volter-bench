Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
- Remove the reset() method from Creature model
- Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- In MainGameScene, simply set hp = max_hp directly when initializing the battle

2. Here are the fixed files:

# Excerpt ID: 2fbf8d38-0ef0-420e-8a4e-5b186e9aaf1e
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

# Excerpt ID: 25820e6d-e2ec-47ba-a2e1-c241b1b7b022
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolve turns
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
                
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into MainGameScene's __init__
3. Kept models as pure data schemas with only attributes

This maintains proper separation between data models and game logic while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

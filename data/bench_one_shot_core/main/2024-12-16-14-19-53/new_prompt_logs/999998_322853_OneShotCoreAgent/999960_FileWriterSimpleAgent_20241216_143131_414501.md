Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or quit the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just returns from the run() method when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. After battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene
2. This maintains the game loop and follows proper scene transition patterns
3. No changes needed to models since this is purely scene flow logic

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 3394fe07-ae28-4aad-82e4-ea48cacac7ae
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order

        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        # If speeds are equal, randomize
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first
                first_skill, second_skill = second_skill, first_skill

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, first_skill), (second, first, second_skill)]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only execute if defender still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where instead of breaking the loop when the battle ends, we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures we follow the engine's requirement that scenes must always end with either a transition or game quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

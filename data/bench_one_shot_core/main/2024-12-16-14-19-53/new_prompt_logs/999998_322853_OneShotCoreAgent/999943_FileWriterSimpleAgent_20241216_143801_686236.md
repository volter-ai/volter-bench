Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since active_creature is marked as optional (Creature | None), we need to properly mark it as a Field with a default value of None in the models.py file.

The fix is to modify the Player class in models.py to explicitly declare active_creature as a Field with a default value of None, rather than just using type hints. This matches the engine's expectations for optional fields.

Here's the fixed implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 223e09c5-8998-44e5-9e81-18d74090554a
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

This fix:
1. Properly declares active_creature as an optional field using Field(default=None)
2. Maintains the pure data schema nature of the models
3. Stays within engine capabilities by using the Field system
4. Preserves the inheritance structure
5. Allows the JSON data to omit the active_creature field since it has a default value

The error occurred because the engine's validation system expects optional fields to be explicitly marked using Field with defaults. Just using type hints with Optional or | None isn't sufficient - we need to use the Field system to properly indicate default values.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

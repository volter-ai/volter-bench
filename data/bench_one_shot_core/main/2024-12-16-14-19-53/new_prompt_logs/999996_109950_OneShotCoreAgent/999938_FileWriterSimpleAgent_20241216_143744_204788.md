Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. When the battle ends (either player wins or loses), we're just returning from the run() method instead of properly ending the scene.

According to the engine's requirements, we must explicitly end scenes using one of these methods. In this case, since it's the end of the game, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` when a player wins or loses.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends
2. Changed the return None pattern in get_player_action to continue the main loop instead of ending it
3. Maintained all the existing game logic and models
4. Stayed within the engine's capabilities by using proper scene transition methods

This fix ensures the scene properly ends using the engine's required methods while maintaining all the game's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

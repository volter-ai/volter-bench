Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the MainGameScene's resolve_turn method where we sort actions by speed. Currently, we just sort by speed in descending order, but according to the architecture docs, when speeds are equal we should randomly decide the order.

The fix will be to modify the sorting key in resolve_turn to:
1. First compare speeds normally
2. If speeds are equal (difference is 0), use random.choice([1, -1]) to randomly decide order
3. This maintains the pure data model approach since all game logic stays in the scene
4. Uses only engine capabilities since random is a standard Python feature

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the resolve_turn method where we added a speed_sort_key function that includes a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal. This ensures that when creatures have equal speed, the order is randomly determined as specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. In the full game flow test, the MainGameScene is not transitioning or quitting, causing the game to terminate unexpectedly.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit after the battle ends. We'll transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes, giving the player the option to play again or quit.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends (when `_check_battle_end` returns True), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits properly by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 03d25313-2c92-467a-9b55-c698f4513c72
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._post_battle_menu()
                break

        self._reset_creatures()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.foe_creature)
        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._apply_damage(self.foe, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker: Player, skill: Skill, target: Creature):
        damage = skill.damage
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} dealt {damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def _post_battle_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the whole game. This should resolve both issues:

1. The MainGameScene test should now pass because either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` will be called.
2. The full game flow test should no longer terminate unexpectedly because the MainGameScene will properly transition or quit.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the issues raised during QA/testing.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The whole game flow test is failing because the MainGameScene is not transitioning or quitting properly.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. We'll do this by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after displaying the battle result.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. Add a transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Ensure that the game loop in the `run` method continues until a transition or quit occurs.
3. Add a check for the random mode counter to exit the scene if it reaches zero.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b9e8937e-a6b7-4a0c-9794-6d3751046b9d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            try:
                # Player Choice Phase
                player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
                
                # Foe Choice Phase
                foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
                
                # Resolution Phase
                self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
                
                # Check for battle end
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    break

            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

        # Transition back to MainMenuScene after battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends or when the random mode counter reaches zero. This should fix both the MainGameScene test and the whole game flow test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue by modifying the `MainGameScene` to handle the case where creatures have the same speed.

1. Description of the fix:

We will modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include a random decision when the creatures have the same speed. This change will align with the architecture document's specification without altering any models or exceeding the engine's capabilities.

Here's how we'll implement this:

- Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
- If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
- Implement the skill execution based on this decision.

2. Rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 152e50ec-3711-4975-ac4a-5998d6c1cb4b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.choice([
                (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)

            first_skill = player_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else foe_skill
            second_skill = foe_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else player_skill

            self._execute_skill(first_attacker, second_attacker, first_skill)
            if second_attacker.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(second_attacker, first_attacker, second_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended! What would you like to do?")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. This change aligns with the architecture document's specifications and maintains the existing structure of the code without modifying any models or exceeding the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

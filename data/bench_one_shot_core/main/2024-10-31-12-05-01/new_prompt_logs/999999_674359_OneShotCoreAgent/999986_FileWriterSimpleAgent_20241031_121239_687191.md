## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We'll add a method to the MainGameScene class to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value.
2. We'll call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this logic within the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix the issue:

# Excerpt ID: a3f34cd3-356e-45b1-945b-11d465fc6ac0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            if player_skill is None:
                return

            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                return

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == quit_button:
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return None

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

In this updated version of `main_game_scene.py`, we've added a new method `_reset_creatures()` that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. This method is called in two places:

1. In the `_check_battle_end()` method, right before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. In the `_player_turn()` method, when the player chooses to quit the game.

This ensures that the creatures' state is reset whenever the player leaves the battle scene, whether by winning/losing the battle or by choosing to quit. We also added a message to inform the player that all creatures have been restored to full health.

These changes address the issue raised in the QA pass while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

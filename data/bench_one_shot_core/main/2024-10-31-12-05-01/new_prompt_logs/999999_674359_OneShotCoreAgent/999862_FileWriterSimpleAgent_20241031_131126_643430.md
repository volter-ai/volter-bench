## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop in MainGameScene to continue running until a transition or quit occurs.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and the game flow continues as expected. Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. The `run` method now includes a `while True` loop that continues until the battle ends. This ensures that the game keeps running until a proper exit condition is met.

2. The `_end_battle` method now calls `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` instead of just resetting the creatures' HP. This ensures that the scene properly transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends.

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing. The MainGameScene will now properly exit by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, and the game loop will continue running until this transition occurs. This should prevent the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error and ensure that the scene exits in an expected manner.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important aspect of the game flow. Let's address this issue:

1. To fix the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state after a battle, we need to implement this functionality in the MainGameScene. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll handle this in the scene itself. Here's how we'll fix it:

   - We'll add a new method called `_reset_creatures_state()` in the MainGameScene.
   - This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their max_hp.
   - We'll call this method at the end of the battle, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b6b1c786-b2eb-42bc-812b-b10f750259f6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

        while True:

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures_state()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds the `_reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent. It's called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset after each battle, as specified in the architecture documentation.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas and handling the game logic within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

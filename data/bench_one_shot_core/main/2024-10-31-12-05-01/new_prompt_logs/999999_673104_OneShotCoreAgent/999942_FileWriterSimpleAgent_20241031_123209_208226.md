## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and allows the game flow to continue.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll call this method when we detect that the battle has ended.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 5f0aa57a-f61b-48d6-95d9-9fafe440cb16
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()

            first, second = self.determine_turn_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            self.execute_turn(*first)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            self.execute_turn(*second)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_data, opponent_data):
        if player_data[1].speed > opponent_data[1].speed:
            return player_data, opponent_data
        elif player_data[1].speed < opponent_data[1].speed:
            return opponent_data, player_data
        else:
            return random.sample([player_data, opponent_data], 2)

    def execute_turn(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
        defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, creature_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This should resolve both issues:

1. The MainGameScene will now exit properly, either by transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game (if the player chooses to quit from the MainMenuScene).
2. The whole game flow should now complete correctly, as the MainGameScene will always transition back to the MainMenuScene, allowing the game loop to continue.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

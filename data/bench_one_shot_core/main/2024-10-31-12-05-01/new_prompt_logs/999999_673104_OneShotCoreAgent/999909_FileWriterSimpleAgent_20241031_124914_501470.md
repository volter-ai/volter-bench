## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the missing implementation of random order handling when creatures have the same speed during the resolution phase.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the solution:

   - Instead of directly comparing speeds, we'll create a list of tuples containing the player, creature, and skill.
   - We'll then shuffle this list if the speeds are equal, ensuring a random order.
   - Finally, we'll execute the skills in the order determined by this process.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture described in the documentation.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4fb4dcb9-8fd6-401f-942b-ae96e8b7c889
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        turn_order = [
            (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
            (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        ]
        
        # If speeds are equal, shuffle the turn order
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            random.shuffle(turn_order)
        else:
            # Sort by speed, higher speed goes first
            turn_order.sort(key=lambda x: x[1].speed, reverse=True)

        for attacker, attacker_creature, skill in turn_order:
            defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
            
            self.execute_skill(attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
            
            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                break  # End the turn if a creature is defeated

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by properly handling the case where creatures have the same speed. It introduces randomness in the turn order when speeds are equal, as specified in the architecture document. The rest of the game logic remains intact, and the solution stays within the capabilities of the engine.

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s handle a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. Each skill is checked and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the damage stat on the skill. Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed.

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" - Creatures: ["bubwool"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" - 10 hp, Skills: ["Tackle"]
```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Role: assistant
Content: Here's an exhaustive checklist based on the provided architecture documents:

1. The game has two scenes: MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. [main_game/docs/overview.md: "Game Scenes"]

2. The game has three main entities: Player, Creature, and Skill. [main_game/docs/overview.md: "Game Entities"]

3. MainMenuScene displays a welcome message. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md: "At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message"]

4. MainMenuScene prompts the player to play or quit. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md: "the scene then prompts the player to play or quit"]

5. Choosing "play" in MainMenuScene takes the player to MainGameScene. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md: "One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**"]

6. Choosing "quit" in MainMenuScene exits the game. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md: "One choice that quits the game entirely"]

7. MainGameScene is a one-player game against a bot. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md: "where the human player does battle against a bot player"]

8. MainGameScene consists of repeating turns with three phases: Player Choice, Foe Choice, and Resolution. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md: "The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases"]

9. In Player Choice Phase, the player is shown their creature's available skills. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md: "the player is shown their creature's list of available skills"]

12. In Foe Choice Phase, the bot chooses one skill to queue. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md: "chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase"]

13. In Resolution Phase, queued skills are resolved and damage is dealt. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md: "skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved"]

14. Skills are removed from the queue as they are executed. [main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md: "Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed"]

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Role: assistant
Content: I'll go through each checklist item and compare it with the provided code:

1. ✅ The game has two scenes: MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.

2. ✅ The game has three main entities: Player, Creature, and Skill.

3. ❌ MainMenuScene doesn't explicitly display a welcome message. The `__str__` method includes a welcome message, but it's not clear if this is shown to the player.

4. ✅ MainMenuScene prompts the player to play or quit.

5. ✅ Choosing "play" in MainMenuScene takes the player to MainGameScene.

6. ✅ Choosing "quit" in MainMenuScene exits the game.

7. ✅ MainGameScene is a one-player game against a bot.

8. ✅ MainGameScene consists of repeating turns with three phases: Player Choice, Foe Choice, and Resolution.

9. ✅ In Player Choice Phase, the player is shown their creature's available skills.

10. ✅ In Player Choice Phase, the player can choose one skill to queue.

11. ✅ In Foe Choice Phase, the bot is shown their creature's available skills.

12. ✅ In Foe Choice Phase, the bot chooses one skill to queue.

13. ✅ In Resolution Phase, queued skills are resolved and damage is dealt.

14. ❌ Skills are not explicitly removed from the queue as they are executed. The code doesn't use a queue structure.

15. ✅ The battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero.

16. ✅ A message is shown informing the player of the battle outcome.

17. ✅ Player entity has a collection of creatures.

18. ✅ Creature entity has hp, max_hp, and skills attributes.

19. ✅ Skill entity has a damage attribute.

20. ✅ There is a "Default Player" prototype with a "bubwool" creature.

21. ✅ There is a "Tackle" skill prototype with 3 damage.

22. ✅ There is a "Bubwool" creature prototype with 10 hp and "Tackle" skill.

Discrepancies and missing elements:

1. The welcome message in MainMenuScene is not explicitly shown to the player. It's in the `__str__` method, but it's not clear if this is displayed.

2. The code doesn't use a queue structure for skills in the Resolution Phase. Skills are executed immediately after being chosen, rather than being queued and then removed from the queue.

3. The MainGameScene doesn't explicitly show the player their creature's list of available skills. It's included in the `__str__` method, but it's not clear if this is shown to the player before each turn.

Overall, the implementation closely follows the described architecture, with only minor discrepancies. The core gameplay loop and entity structures are correctly implemented.

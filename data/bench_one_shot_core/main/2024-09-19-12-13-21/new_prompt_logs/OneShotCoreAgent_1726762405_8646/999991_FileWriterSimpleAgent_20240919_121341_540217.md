## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to explicitly show the opposing player's creature's list of available skills during the Foe Choice Phase. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll update the `_foe_choice_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to display the opponent's creature's skills before making a choice.

2. We'll modify the `__str__` method of the `MainGameScene` to include both the player's and opponent's creature skills, so that all relevant information is visible at all times.

3. We'll add a new method `_format_creature_info` to create a formatted string for each creature's information, including their skills.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f49b1098-b8f3-4d00-abad-7148a6527146
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        while True:

        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:

            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
```

These changes address the issue raised during QA/testing:

1. The `__str__` method now includes both the player's and opponent's creature information, including their available skills.

2. The `_foe_choice_phase` method now explicitly shows the opposing player's creature's list of available skills before making a choice.

3. We've added a new `_format_creature_info` method to create a formatted string for each creature's information, including their skills.

4. The `_player_choice_phase` and `_foe_choice_phase` methods now show text indicating whose turn it is to choose a skill.

These modifications ensure that the implementation explicitly shows the opposing player's creature's list of available skills during the Foe Choice Phase, as required by the architecture. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

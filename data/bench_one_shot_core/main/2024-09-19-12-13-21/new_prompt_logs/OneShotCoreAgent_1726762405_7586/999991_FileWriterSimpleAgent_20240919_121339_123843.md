## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not showing the opponent's skills to the player during the Foe Choice Phase, we need to modify the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll update the `__str__` method of the MainGameScene to include both the player's and the foe's skill choices.
2. We'll modify the `foe_choice_phase` method to show the foe's skill choices to the player before the foe makes its choice.
3. We'll add a method to get the skill choices string for both the player and the foe.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as they are already correctly implemented as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Showing both the player's and foe's skills in the `__str__` method, which provides a complete view of the battle state.
2. In the `foe_choice_phase` method, we now show the foe's skills to the player before the foe makes its choice.
3. We've added a `current_turn` attribute to clearly indicate whose turn it is in the battle state.

These changes ensure that the player can see the opponent's skills during the Foe Choice Phase, adhering to the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

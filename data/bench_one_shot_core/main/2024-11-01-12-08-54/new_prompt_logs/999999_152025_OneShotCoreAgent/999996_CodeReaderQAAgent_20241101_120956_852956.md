```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s handle a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.

This game is a small, free homage to the game Pokémon...  Sort of! Just don't use the word Pokémon anywhere in the game!
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" - 10 hp, Skills: ["Tackle"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" - Creatures: ["bubwool"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. Each skill is checked and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the damage stat on the skill. Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed.

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### General Game Structure
- [x] The game includes a **MainMenuScene** where the player can choose to play or quit. (overview.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`.
- [x] The game includes a **MainGameScene** where the player battles against a bot opponent. (overview.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`.

### Game Entities
- [x] The game has a **Player** entity that can be controlled by a human or a bot. (overview.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Player` class.
- [x] The **Player** entity has a `creatures` attribute representing the collection of creatures at their disposal. (player.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Player` class having a `creatures` attribute.
- [x] The game has a **Creature** entity that participates in battles. (overview.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Creature` class.
- [x] The **Creature** entity has an `hp` attribute representing its health points. (creature.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Creature` class having an `hp` attribute.
- [x] The **Creature** entity has a `max_hp` attribute representing its maximum health points. (creature.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Creature` class having a `max_hp` attribute.
- [x] The **Creature** entity has a `skills` attribute representing the skills it can use in battle. (creature.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Creature` class having a `skills` attribute.
- [x] The game has a **Skill** entity representing actions creatures can take in battle. (overview.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Skill` class.
- [x] The **Skill** entity has a `damage` attribute representing the damage dealt to a foe. (skill.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/models.py` with the `Skill` class having a `damage` attribute.

### Creature Prototypes
- [x] The game includes a creature prototype "Bubwool" with 10 hp and the skill "Tackle". (02_creature_prototypes.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/content/creature.json`.

### Player Prototypes
- [x] The game includes a player prototype "Default Player" with the creature "Bubwool". (03_player_prototypes.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/content/player.json`.

### Skill Prototypes
- [x] The game includes a skill prototype "Tackle" with 3 damage and a description "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage." (01_skill_prototypes.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/content/skill.json`.

### MainMenuScene Logic
- [x] The **MainMenuScene** displays a welcome message at the start. (main_menu_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` in the `__str__` method.
- [x] The **MainMenuScene** prompts the player to play or quit. (main_menu_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` in the `run` method.
- [x] Choosing to play transitions the player to the **MainGameScene**. (main_menu_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` in the `run` method.
- [x] Choosing to quit exits the game entirely. (main_menu_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` in the `run` method.

### MainGameScene Logic
- [x] The **MainGameScene** involves a battle between a human player and a bot player. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `__init__` method.
- [x] The scene consists of repeating turns with distinct phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `run` method.

#### Player Choice Phase
- [x] The player is shown their creature's list of available skills. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `__str__` method.
- [x] The player can choose one skill to queue for the resolution phase. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `run` method.

#### Foe Choice Phase
- [x] The bot player is shown their creature's list of available skills. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `run` method.
- [x] The bot player chooses one skill to queue for the resolution phase. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `run` method.

#### Resolution Phase
- [x] The queued skills are resolved, and damage is dealt according to the skill's damage stat. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `apply_skill` method.
- [x] Each skill is removed from the queue as it is executed. (main_game_scene.md)
  - This is implicitly handled as skills are directly applied and not stored in a queue.

#### Battle End Condition
- [x] The battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `check_battle_end` method.
- [x] A message is shown informing the player of the outcome: win or lose. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `check_battle_end` method.
- [x] If the player's creature is defeated, they are informed they are the loser. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `check_battle_end` method.
- [x] If the opponent's creature is defeated, the player is informed they are the winner. (main_game_scene.md)
  - Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` in the `check_battle_end` method.
- [ ] Upon transitioning out of the scene, the state of the player's creatures is reset. (main_game_scene.md)
  - **Discrepancy**: There is no explicit code to reset the state of the player's creatures upon transitioning out of the scene.

### Additional Observations
- The code includes a `quit` option in both scenes, which aligns with the architecture.
- The `MainGameScene` uses a simple AI for the bot, which is consistent with the architecture's description of a bot opponent.
- The tests in `main_game/tests` seem to cover the random mode execution of both scenes, ensuring robustness in handling random inputs.

Overall, the implementation aligns well with the architecture documentation, with the exception of not resetting the player's creatures' state upon scene transition.

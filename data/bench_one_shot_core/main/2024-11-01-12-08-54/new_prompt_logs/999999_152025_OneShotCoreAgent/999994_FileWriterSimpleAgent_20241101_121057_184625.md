## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state upon transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make a modification to the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `check_battle_end()` method.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as we're only adding game logic to the scene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 24f97d06-614d-46c5-9dd8-fbb19bfb957e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if quit_button == choice:
                self.reset_creatures_state()
                self._quit_whole_game()

            if use_skill_button == choice:
                skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
                skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
                self.apply_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

            # Opponent turn
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_creature.skills[0]  # Simple AI: always use the first skill
            self.apply_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def apply_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds the `reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. The method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `check_battle_end()` method, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset properly for subsequent plays. It's also called before quitting the game, just to ensure consistency.

This change addresses the issue raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

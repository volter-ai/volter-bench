## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The resolution phase doesn't handle the case where creatures have the same speed, which should result in a random decision for who goes first. I'll fix this in the MainGameScene. Here's how I'll address it:

1. In the resolution_phase method, I'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If speeds are equal, I'll use Python's random.choice to decide which creature goes first.
3. I'll then execute the skills in the randomly determined order.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 04846ac9-a8f0-4260-b08f-c3cc31e095d2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")
        self.game_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            creatures = [(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, 2)

        self.execute_skill(*first, second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(*second, first[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Checking if the speeds are equal in the resolution_phase method.
2. If speeds are equal, using random.sample to randomly determine the order of skill execution.
3. Executing the skills in the determined order, whether it's based on speed difference or random selection.

These changes ensure that the game mechanics align with the architecture description, handling the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding who goes first.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that the MainGameScene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. To fix this, we need to modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a check to exit the scene if the player chooses to quit.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: cc6cb1d9-97af-4001-851b-eceb6187a364
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            use_skill_button = Button("Use skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if use_skill_button == choice:
                self._battle_turn()
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    self._reset_creatures()
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
            elif quit_button == choice:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _battle_turn(self):
        player_skill = self._choose_skill(self.player, self.player_creature)
        bot_skill = self._choose_skill(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

        self._resolve_skills(player_skill, bot_skill)

    def _choose_skill(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, skill_choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Your {self.bot_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that the scene exits properly, either when the battle ends or when the player chooses to quit. The scene will transition back to the MainMenuScene in both cases, which should satisfy the test conditions.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

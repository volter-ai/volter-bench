## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the choice phases.
2. Implement action queuing instead of immediate execution.
3. Implement speed-based action resolution.
4. Correctly handle swapped-in creatures.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. I'll add a 'Back' button to the skill and swap choices, allowing players to return to the main action selection.
2. I'll create an `Action` class to represent queued actions, storing them until the resolution phase.
3. I'll implement a `resolve_actions` method that sorts actions based on creature speed and executes them in order.
4. I'll modify the swap action to ensure that swapped-in creatures are hit by opponent's queued skills.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. Added a 'Back' option in the choice phases for both skills and swaps.
2. Implemented action queuing using the `Action` class instead of immediate execution.
3. Implemented speed-based action resolution in the `resolve_actions` method.
4. Correctly handled swapped-in creatures by executing opponent's attack after the swap if applicable.

The implementation now follows the described architecture more closely, addressing the key discrepancies mentioned in the QA report. The game flow now includes separate choice and resolution phases, with actions being queued and resolved based on speed.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement a tie-breaking mechanism for equal speed scenarios in skill execution order.
2. Modify the damage calculation to explicitly use floats throughout the process.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `resolve_actions` method, I'll add a random tie-breaker for actions with equal speed.
2. I'll update the `calculate_damage` method to use floats for all calculations and only round to an integer at the very end.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. In the `resolve_actions` method, I added a random tie-breaker (`random.random()`) for actions with equal speed. This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, the order of their actions is randomly determined.

2. In the `calculate_damage` method, I modified the calculations to explicitly use floats throughout the process. All values are converted to floats at the beginning of the calculation, and the final result is only rounded to an integer at the very end. This should prevent any potential rounding errors during the intermediate calculations.

3. In the `get_type_factor` method, I changed the effectiveness values to floats to ensure consistency with the float calculations in `calculate_damage`.

These modifications should resolve the issues identified in the QA report while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game. The implementation now handles equal speed scenarios correctly and uses floats for damage calculations as required by the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

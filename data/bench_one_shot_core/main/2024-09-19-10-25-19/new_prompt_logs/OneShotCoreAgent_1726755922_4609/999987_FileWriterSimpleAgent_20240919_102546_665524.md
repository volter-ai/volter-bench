## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to show the opponent's creature's available skills during the Foe Choice Phase. This aligns with the described architecture and provides more transparency in the game flow. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `foe_choice_phase` method to display the foe's available skills.
2. We'll use the `_show_text` method to present this information to the player.
3. We'll still use random selection for the foe's choice, but now the player will be informed about the available options.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models. It only involves modifying the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [Button("Continue")])
```

This implementation addresses the issue by modifying the `foe_choice_phase` method to show the opponent's creature's available skills. The method now:

1. Displays a list of the foe's creature's available skills using `_show_text`.
2. Randomly selects a skill for the foe to use.
3. Informs the player about the foe's chosen skill.

These changes provide more transparency in the game flow and align with the described architecture. The implementation still stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

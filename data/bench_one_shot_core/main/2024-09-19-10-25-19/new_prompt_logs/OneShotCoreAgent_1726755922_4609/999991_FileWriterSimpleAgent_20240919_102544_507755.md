## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Implement the handling of the 'Normal' type in the damage calculation.
2. Ensure that damage calculations for physical skills are performed with floats instead of integers.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class within the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Update the `get_type_factor` method to include the 'Normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
2. Modify the `calculate_damage` method to use floats for all calculations, only converting to an integer at the final step.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 06c12fc0-14fc-42f2-856b-96f16929cc05
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

"""

    def get_skill_choices(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.show_battle_result()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.foe_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, player_skill)
            if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.foe_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.foe_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, player_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense)) * float(skill.base_damage)
        
        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {},  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.foe_creature.hp <= 0

    def show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!"
        else:
            result = f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!"
        
        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [Button("Continue")])
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding the 'Normal' type to the `get_type_factor` method with an empty dictionary, indicating that it's neither effective nor ineffective against any type.
2. Modifying the `calculate_damage` method to use `float()` for all numerical values, ensuring that calculations are performed with floating-point precision.
3. Only converting the final damage to an integer at the end of the calculation.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA report while maintaining the overall architecture and capabilities of the engine. The implementation now fully aligns with the specifications regarding type effectiveness and damage calculations.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't properly end the game by calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. When a battle ends, it just returns from the run method without properly signaling the end of the game.

According to the engine's requirements, we need to explicitly end the game using `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle is over, since this is the final scene in our game flow.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now properly end the game by calling `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition to another scene or quit the game rather than just returning from their run method.

The rest of the implementation remains the same since it was working correctly. This change ensures we properly signal the end of the game to the engine when a battle concludes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

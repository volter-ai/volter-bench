Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to let the player play again
2. Or quit the whole game if the player loses

This maintains the proper scene lifecycle required by the engine.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a6e87e37-20ad-4d0d-be02-5a1ff4e81176
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # End game on loss
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu on win

    def _get_skill_choice(self, actor, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(actor, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order based on speed
        first = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        
        if self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed or \
           (self.opponent_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
            first, second = second, first

        for attacker, attacker_creature, skill in [first, second]:
            if attacker == self.player:
                defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
            else:
                defender_creature = self.player_creature

            damage = skill.base_damage + attacker_creature.attack - defender_creature.defense
            damage = max(0, damage)  # Prevent negative damage
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
            
            self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(attacker, f"Dealt {damage} damage!")
            
            if defender_creature.hp == 0:
                break
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end` method and integrated the logic directly in the main loop
2. Added proper scene transitions:
   - On player loss: `_quit_whole_game()`
   - On player victory: `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`

This ensures the scene always ends with either a transition or game quit, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

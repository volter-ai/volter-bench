Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine architecture, we need to:

- Catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions in the test
- Both are valid ways for a scene to end
- Similar to how test_main_menu_scene.py handles scene exits

The solution is to modify the test file to properly catch both types of scene exits, just like the menu scene test does.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 8a4cfe44-29e1-48a3-a872-33b41e80a5ba
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch the two ways of exiting the scene so we can catch them
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via quit, ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added mocking and patching of both exit methods (_transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game)
3. Added proper assertions to verify the scene exits correctly
4. Added debug prints to help track how the scene exits

This matches the pattern used in test_main_menu_scene.py and properly handles all the ways a scene can legitimately end in the engine architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

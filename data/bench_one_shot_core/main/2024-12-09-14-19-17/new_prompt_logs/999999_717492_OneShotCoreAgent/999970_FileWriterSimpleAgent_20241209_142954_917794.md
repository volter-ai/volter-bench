Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the MainGameScene test. When the battle ends and transitions to MainMenuScene, the menu scene is quitting the game (which is expected behavior), but the test isn't catching this exception.

The fix should:
- Catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test
- This matches how the MainMenuScene test handles it
- No changes needed to the game logic or models, just the test handling

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 496d43a8-7895-4843-9f6a-5397c3ee602c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print("Game quit gracefully via menu")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
```

The key change is adding the try/except block to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame. This matches how the engine expects the game to end (through an explicit quit) and aligns with how the MainMenuScene test handles it.

The game logic remains unchanged since this was just a test handling issue, not a game logic issue. The scene transition and quit behavior is working as intended, we just needed to properly catch the quit exception in our test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene when trying to get a bot's action for swapping creatures. The error message shows we're calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list of choices, which happens when there are no valid creatures to swap to.

Looking at the logs, this occurs after several rounds of combat where creatures have likely been knocked out. The issue is in the `get_player_action` method where we don't handle the case when there are no available creatures to swap to.

The fix should:
1. Check if there are available creatures before offering the "Swap" option
2. Only show "Attack" if the creature has skills available
3. Handle the case where a creature might have no skills (though this shouldn't happen with our current data)

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method where we now:
1. Build the list of choices dynamically based on available actions
2. Only show "Swap" if there are creatures available to swap to
3. Only show "Attack" if the creature has skills
4. Add a fallback to force "Attack" if no other choices are available

This should prevent the empty choices list error while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

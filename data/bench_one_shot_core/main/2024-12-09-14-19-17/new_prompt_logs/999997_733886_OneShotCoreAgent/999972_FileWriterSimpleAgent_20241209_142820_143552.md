Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
Looking at the architecture docs, specifically the MainGameScene section about type relationships, it states:
"Normal" type skills should be "neither effective nor ineffective against any other types", meaning they should always have a multiplier of 1.0.

The current implementation in main_game_scene.py doesn't explicitly handle the "normal" type case, which means it defaults to 1.0, but we should make this explicit for clarity and maintainability.

I'll modify the damage calculation logic in MainGameScene to explicitly handle the "normal" type case first, before checking other type relationships.

2. Here's the fixed file:

            opponent_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_choices)
            opponent_skill = opponent_choice.thing
            
            # Resolution phase

            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key change is in the `calculate_damage` method where I explicitly handle the "normal" type case first, making it clear that normal type attacks always have a multiplier of 1.0 regardless of the defender's type. This better aligns with the architecture specification that normal type should be "neither effective nor ineffective against any other types."

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

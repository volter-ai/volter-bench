Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends (win or lose), show the result message
2. Then transition back to MainMenuScene to allow the player to play again or quit
3. This maintains the proper scene flow and follows the engine's requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0

            first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            second = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:

            if defender.hp <= 0:
                continue
                
            damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
            defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)

        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_choices).thing
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_choices).thing
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.execute_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu after battle
                return
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu after battle
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Instead of breaking the loop, we now properly transition back to MainMenuScene
2. Added return statements to ensure the scene terminates after transition
3. Maintained all the existing battle mechanics
4. Kept the same model structure and scene architecture

This ensures the game follows the proper scene flow required by the engine while maintaining the same gameplay experience.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes:

1. Add a method to reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Ensure all intermediate damage calculations are performed with floats before the final conversion to an integer.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. In the `MainGameScene` class, I'll add a `_reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP. This method will be called when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, I'll explicitly use float() for all intermediate calculations to ensure they're performed with floating-point precision.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `_reset_creatures_state` method has been added and is called in the `_end_battle` method, which is invoked when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that all creatures' HP is reset to their max HP when leaving the MainGameScene.

2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, all intermediate calculations now explicitly use `float()` to ensure they're performed with floating-point precision. The final conversion to an integer is done only at the end of the calculation.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the issues raised in the QA pass.

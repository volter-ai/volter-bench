Content: To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Handle the case of equal speed between creatures in the Resolution Phase by adding a random tiebreaker.
2. Make the conversion from float to integer for final damage explicit.
3. Update the _force_swap method to handle the case where there are no available creatures to swap to, ending the battle in that case.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.
2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, I'll use `int()` to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer.
3. In the `_force_swap` method, I'll add a check for no available creatures and end the battle if that's the case.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.
2. The `_calculate_damage` method now explicitly converts the final damage to an integer using `int()`.
3. The `_force_swap` method now checks if there are no available creatures and ends the battle if that's the case.

Additionally, I've added an `_end_battle` method to centralize the logic for ending the battle and transitioning to the main menu. This method is called from both `_force_swap` and `_check_battle_end` to ensure consistent behavior when the battle ends.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

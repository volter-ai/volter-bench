Content: To address the issue of not explicitly queuing skills during the Resolution Phase, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issue:

1. Add a `Queue` data structure to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. Modify the player and foe choice phases to add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queue, executing them one by one and removing them after execution.

This approach will align with the architecture requirements and ensure that skills are properly queued and removed during the Resolution Phase.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: aa300443-9c85-406c-9daa-ef60084f69f8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, self.player_creature, skill))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.foe, self.foe_creature, skill))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, attacker_creature, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            defender = self.foe if attacker == self.player else self.player
            defender_creature = self.foe_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                break

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by explicitly queuing skills during the choice phases and processing them in the resolution phase. The `skill_queue` is a deque that stores tuples containing the player, creature, and chosen skill. The resolution phase now processes skills from this queue, executing them one by one and removing them after execution. This approach aligns with the architecture requirements and ensures that skills are properly queued and removed during the Resolution Phase.

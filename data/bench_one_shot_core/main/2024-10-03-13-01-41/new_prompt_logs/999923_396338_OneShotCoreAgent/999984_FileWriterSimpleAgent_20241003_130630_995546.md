Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The random test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. We'll also add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method to return a boolean indicating whether the player won or lost.
2. We'll update the `run` method to handle the battle result and transition to the appropriate scene.
3. We'll add a method to display the battle result and prompt the player to return to the main menu.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 358a59ab-d8d6-47ad-98a2-79cccd7a9809
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        player_won = self.battle_loop()
        self.show_battle_result(player_won)
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            battle_result = self.check_battle_end()
            if battle_result is not None:
                return battle_result

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            return False
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True
        return None

    def show_battle_result(self, player_won):
        if player_won:
            result_text = f"Congratulations! {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} won the battle!"
        else:
            result_text = f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. Better luck next time!"
        
        self._show_text(self.player, result_text)
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [Button("Return to Main Menu")])

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes. The `run` method now handles the battle result and shows the appropriate message before transitioning. This should fix both the scene termination issue and the random test failure.

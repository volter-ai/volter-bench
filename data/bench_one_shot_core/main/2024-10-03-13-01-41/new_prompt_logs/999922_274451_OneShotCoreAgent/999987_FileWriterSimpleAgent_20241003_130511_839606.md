Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the `_calculate_type_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class. This method is responsible for determining the effectiveness of attacks based on type relationships. Here's how I'll fix the issues:

1. Add handling for the 'Normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
2. Implement the correct effectiveness for the 'Leaf' type against 'Water' and 'Fire'.

The file that needs to be updated is `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`. I'll rewrite this file with the proposed solution.

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self._check_battle_end():

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self._calculate_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        effectiveness = "It's super effective!" if type_factor > 1 else "It's not very effective..." if type_factor < 1 else ""
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        type_chart = {
            "normal": {},  # Normal is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return type_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

In this updated version of `main_game_scene.py`, I've made the following changes to the `_calculate_type_factor` method:

1. Added an empty dictionary for the "normal" type in the `type_chart`. This ensures that normal-type skills are neither effective nor ineffective against any type, always returning a factor of 1.

2. Corrected the effectiveness of the "leaf" type against "water" and "fire" types. Now, leaf-type skills are effective against water-type creatures (factor of 2) and ineffective against fire-type creatures (factor of 0.5).

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game. The implementation now correctly handles all type relationships as specified in the architecture.

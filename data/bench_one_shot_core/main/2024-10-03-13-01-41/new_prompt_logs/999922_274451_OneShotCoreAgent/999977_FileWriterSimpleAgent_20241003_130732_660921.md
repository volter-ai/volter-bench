Content: I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method `from_prototype_id` to the Player model, which violates the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties. To fix this, we need to remove the method from the Player class and handle the creation of Player instances elsewhere in the code, likely in the scenes or in a separate utility function.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` method from the Player class in `models.py`.
2. Keep the Player, Creature, and Skill models as pure data schemas.
3. Create a utility function in `main.py` to handle the creation of Player instances from prototype IDs.

Let's rewrite the `models.py` file to fix this issue:

# Excerpt ID: c10f5948-a2d5-4893-8dc6-9c4da2e4fae9
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, let's update the `main.py` file to include a utility function for creating Player instances:

# Excerpt ID: bd066fb4-d5ed-4185-99ed-c23b74d8ea51
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

def create_player_from_prototype(prototype_id: str) -> Player:
    player_data = create_from_game_database(prototype_id, Player)
    creature_prototypes = player_data.creatures
    player_data.creatures = [create_from_game_database(creature_id, Creature) for creature_id in creature_prototypes]
    return Player(**player_data.dict())

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_player_from_prototype("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_player_from_prototype(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes accomplish the following:

1. The `models.py` file now contains only pure data schemas without any methods, adhering to the guidelines.
2. We've created a new utility function `create_player_from_prototype` in `main.py` that handles the creation of Player instances from prototype IDs.
3. This function uses the `create_from_game_database` function to create the initial Player instance and then creates Creature instances for the player's creatures.
4. The `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in the App class now use this utility function to create Player instances.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the required structure and functionality of the Player model. The models remain pure data schemas, and the logic for creating instances from prototypes is now handled outside of the model classes.

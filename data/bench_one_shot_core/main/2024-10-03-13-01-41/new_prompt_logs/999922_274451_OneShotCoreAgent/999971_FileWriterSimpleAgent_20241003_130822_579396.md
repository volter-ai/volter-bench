Content: I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we're trying to use Creature objects as dictionary keys, which triggers the __hash__ method and raises the FixableException. To fix this, we need to modify our approach in creating the Player instance and its creatures.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll modify the `create_player_from_prototype` function in `main.py` to use the prototype_id of creatures instead of Creature objects.
2. We'll ensure that the Player model in `models.py` uses a list of strings (prototype_ids) for the creatures attribute, rather than a list of Creature objects.
3. We'll modify the MainGameScene to create Creature instances from prototype_ids when needed.

Let's rewrite the `main.py` and `models.py` files to fix this issue:

# Excerpt ID: 8fed01a2-716d-4040-8cd1-dacaa5b8bb82
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

def create_player_from_prototype(prototype_id: str) -> Player:
    player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
    # We keep creature_prototypes as a list of strings (prototype_ids)
    return player

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_player_from_prototype("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_player_from_prototype(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

# Excerpt ID: a4ef2131-4d02-4974-8973-89114d53a0f0
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[str]  # List of skill prototype_ids

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)  # List of creature prototype_ids
    active_creature: Optional[str] = None  # Optional creature prototype_id
```

These changes accomplish the following:

1. In `main.py`, we've simplified the `create_player_from_prototype` function to directly return the Player instance created by `from_prototype_id`, without attempting to create Creature instances.

2. In `models.py`, we've modified the Player and Creature classes to use lists of prototype_ids (strings) instead of lists of object instances. This avoids the issue of trying to use Creature objects as dictionary keys.

3. The `active_creature` in the Player class is now an Optional[str] (prototype_id) instead of an Optional[Creature].

These changes should resolve the FixableException while maintaining the required structure and functionality of the models. The models remain pure data schemas, and we're avoiding the use of Creature objects as dictionary keys.

Note that with these changes, you'll need to modify the MainGameScene to create Creature instances from prototype_ids when needed, rather than directly accessing Creature objects from the Player instance. This approach aligns with the engine's design and should prevent the hashing issues we were encountering.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the game correctly, which is causing the test to fail.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. After a battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the main menu.
3. We'll ensure that the `run` method continues to loop until a transition occurs.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0512f438-f07d-429e-b363-2c0e5ff257c6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            if self.battle_round():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def battle_round(self) -> bool:
        player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
        foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
        return self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill) -> bool:
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} wins!")
            return True

        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name} wins!")
            return True

        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `run` method continues to loop until the battle ends.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that handles the end of the battle, resets the creatures, and transitions back to the main menu.
3. Calling `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the battle, which should properly exit the scene and prevent the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected, transitioning back to the main menu after each battle.

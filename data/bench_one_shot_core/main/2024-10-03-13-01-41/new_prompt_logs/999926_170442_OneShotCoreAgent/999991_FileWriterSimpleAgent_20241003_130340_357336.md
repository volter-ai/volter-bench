Content: Thank you for providing the feedback. I understand that the implementation is missing an explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the lack of an explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase, we'll make the following changes:

a. Add a `SkillQueue` class to the `models.py` file. This class will inherit from `AbstractThing` and contain a list of `Skill` objects.

b. Update the `MainGameScene` to use the `SkillQueue` for storing and resolving skills during the battle.

c. Modify the player and foe choice phases to add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.

d. Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queue in order.

These changes will align the implementation with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Rewritten files:

First, let's update the `models.py` file to include the `SkillQueue` class:

# Excerpt ID: a9bbe57f-1125-4448-a6c9-f4f43655bb7b
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]

class SkillQueue(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "SkillQueue"
    skills: List[Skill] = Field(default_factory=list)
```

Now, let's update the `main_game_scene.py` file to incorporate the `SkillQueue` and implement the explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase:

# Excerpt ID: 5b7764cd-4537-4fbb-af2c-b9753655a615
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill, SkillQueue

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = SkillQueue(display_name="Skill Queue", prototype_id="skill_queue")

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            if self.battle_round():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def battle_round(self) -> bool:
        self.skill_queue.skills.clear()
        self.player_choice_phase()
        self.foe_choice_phase()
        return self.resolution_phase()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.skills.append(skill)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.skills.append(skill)

    def resolution_phase(self) -> bool:
        for skill in self.skill_queue.skills:
            if self.skill_queue.skills.index(skill) == 0:
                attacker, defender = self.player, self.foe
                attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.player_creature, self.foe_creature
            else:
                attacker, defender = self.foe, self.player
                attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.foe_creature, self.player_creature

            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} wins!")
                return True

        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes implement an explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. The `SkillQueue` class is added to the `models.py` file, and the `MainGameScene` now uses this queue to store and process skills during the battle. This implementation aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "overwrite",
      "excerpt_id": "a9bbe57f-1125-4448-a6c9-f4f43655bb7b",
      "file_path": "main_game/models.py"
    },
    {
      "action": "overwrite",
      "excerpt_id": "5b7764cd-4537-4fbb-af2c-b9753655a615",
      "file_path": "main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON object specifies two actions, each of which will overwrite a specific excerpt in a file. The `excerpt_id` corresponds to the specific code block to be replaced, and the `file_path` indicates the file where the change should be applied.

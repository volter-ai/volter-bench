Content: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll address the two issues identified in the QA pass:

1. The resolution phase doesn't handle equal speeds randomly.
2. The final damage calculation doesn't explicitly convert to an integer.

Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal. This will ensure that when two creatures have the same speed, the order is determined randomly.

2. In the `_perform_attack` method, we'll explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the `int()` function.

These changes will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with these fixes:

```

These changes address both issues identified in the QA pass:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random factor in the sorting key when speeds are equal, ensuring that equal speeds are handled randomly.
2. The `_perform_attack` method now explicitly converts the final damage to an integer using `int()`.

These modifications should make the implementation fully compliant with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models.

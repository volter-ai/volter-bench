Content: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll address the issues identified in the QA pass:

1. Explicitly reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Ensure intermediate damage calculations are performed with floats before the final conversion to an integer.

Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. We'll add a new method `_reset_all_creatures` to the MainGameScene class. This method will reset all creatures for both the player and the bot. We'll call this method when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. In the `_perform_attack` method, we'll explicitly use float calculations for all intermediate steps before the final conversion to an integer.

These changes will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with these fixes:

        self.bot.active_creature = None
```

These changes address both issues identified in the QA pass:

1. The `_reset_all_creatures` method now explicitly resets all creatures' state for both the player and the bot, including setting the active creature to None. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. The `_perform_attack` method now uses explicit float calculations for all intermediate steps before the final conversion to an integer. The `_get_type_effectiveness` method also returns float values.

These modifications should make the implementation fully compliant with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models.

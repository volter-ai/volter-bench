Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which is causing the test to fail. We'll update the `game_loop` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends and we reset the creatures, we'll add a transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll also add a brief message to inform the player that they're returning to the main menu.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 85234d2a-f304-4234-87de-13d6d70a7ca7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} uses {foe_skill.display_name}!")

        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

        self.foe_creature.hp = max(0, self.foe_creature.hp)
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated. You lose!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"You defeated {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}. You win!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You defeated {self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}. You win!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} was defeated. You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. This should resolve the test failures and make the game flow as expected.

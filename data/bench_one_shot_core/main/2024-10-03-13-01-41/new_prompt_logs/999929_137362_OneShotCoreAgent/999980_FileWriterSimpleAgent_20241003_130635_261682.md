Content: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I'll address the issues raised during QA/testing and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Description of the fix:

a) Weakness-resistance factor:
We'll modify the `get_type_factor` method to correctly handle all type relationships, including the 'Normal' type.

b) Special skill damage calculation:
We'll adjust the damage calculation for special skills to match the architecture description.

c) 'Normal' type handling:
We'll ensure that the 'Normal' type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

To implement these changes, we'll modify the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. We'll update the `calculate_damage` and `get_type_factor` methods to align with the architecture.

2. Rewritten file:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `get_type_factor` method now correctly handles the 'Normal' type, ensuring it's neither effective nor ineffective against any other type.
2. The damage calculation for both physical and special skills now aligns with the architecture description.
3. The weakness-resistance factor is applied correctly in the `calculate_damage` method.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while maintaining the core functionality of the game. The implementation now fully aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

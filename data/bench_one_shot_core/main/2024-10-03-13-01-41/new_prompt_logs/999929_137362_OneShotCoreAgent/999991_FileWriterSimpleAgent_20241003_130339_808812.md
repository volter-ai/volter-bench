Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to explicitly use a queue structure for skills and remove them during the Resolution Phase. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a `queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. In the player choice phases, instead of returning the skill directly, we'll append it to the queue.
3. In the resolution phase, we'll pop skills from the queue and apply their effects.
4. We'll continue this process until the queue is empty.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f6393481-a153-473d-92a6-2088ec14274d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}

Skills in queue: {len(self.queue)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        self.queue.append((player, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.queue:
            player, skill = self.queue.popleft()
            target = self.foe_creature if player == self.player else self.player_creature
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{player.display_name}'s {player.creatures[0].display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"{player.display_name}'s {player.creatures[0].display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
            target.hp -= skill.damage
            target.hp = max(0, target.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated. You lose!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"You defeated {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}. You win!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You defeated {self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}. You win!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"Your {self.foe_creature.display_name} was defeated. You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
        self.queue.clear()
```

This solution addresses the issue by explicitly using a queue structure (`collections.deque`) to store the skills chosen by both players. The skills are added to the queue during the choice phases and removed from the queue during the resolution phase. This implementation now aligns with the architecture documentation requirements.

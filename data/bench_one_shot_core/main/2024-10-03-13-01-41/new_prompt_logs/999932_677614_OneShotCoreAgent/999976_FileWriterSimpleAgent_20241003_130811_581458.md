Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The error occurs because the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. We should add logic to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_check_battle_end` method, instead of just showing the result text, we'll add a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.
2. We'll also add a short delay using `self._show_text` to display the result before transitioning, giving the player time to see the outcome.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

            return True
        return False

```

This modification ensures that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, regardless of the outcome. The added delay using `self._show_text` gives the player a moment to see the result before returning to the main menu. This should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Handle the case where two creatures have equal speed:
   We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to randomly determine the order of actions when creatures have equal speed.

2. Explicitly convert the final damage to an integer:
   We'll update the `_perform_attack` method to ensure the final damage is explicitly converted to an integer.

Here's how we'll implement these changes:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.
2. In the `_perform_attack` method, we'll use the `int()` function to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random tiebreaker (`random.random()`) in the sorting key. This ensures that when two creatures have equal speed, their order is randomly determined.

2. In the `_perform_attack` method, the `final_damage` calculation now explicitly uses the `int()` function to convert the result to an integer.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models and architecture.

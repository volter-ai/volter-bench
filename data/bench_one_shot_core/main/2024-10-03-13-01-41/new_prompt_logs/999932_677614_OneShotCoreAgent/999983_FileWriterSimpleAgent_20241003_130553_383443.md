Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include the 'Leaf' type in the effectiveness dictionary.
2. Explicitly define the effectiveness of the 'Normal' type to ensure clarity.

These changes will be made in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The rest of the implementation will remain the same, as it adheres to the guidelines and architecture of the engine.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8ae3b236-9649-489d-a8b4-b050c0fa3614
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
                break
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        attacker_name = self.player.display_name if attacker == self.player_creature else self.opponent.display_name
        defender_name = self.opponent.display_name if attacker == self.player_creature else self.player.display_name
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_name}'s {attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_name}'s {defender.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Leaf' type is now included in the `effectiveness` dictionary within the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
2. The effectiveness of the 'Normal' type is explicitly defined for all other types (fire, water, and leaf).
3. The default case (returning 1 for any undefined combinations) is still in place as a fallback.

These changes ensure that all type relationships are correctly handled while maintaining the existing architecture and adhering to the engine's capabilities.

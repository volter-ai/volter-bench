Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to ensure consistency between the architecture document and the implementation. The discrepancy lies in the creature type of "Dumbird", which is described as "normal" in the architecture but implemented as "leaf" in the JSON file. To maintain consistency with the architecture, we should change the creature type of "Dumbird" back to "normal" in the JSON file.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `main_game/content/creature.json` file to change the `creature_type` of Dumbird from "leaf" back to "normal".
2. We'll also update the description to reflect this change.
3. No changes are needed in the `models.py` file or other files, as they already handle different creature types correctly.

Now, let's rewrite the `creature.json` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 022f4fd7-8b85-4bdc-8186-8dc2022551db
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water-type creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 32,
      "max_hp": 32,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 10,
      "sp_attack": 12,
      "sp_defense": 12,
      "speed": 13,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard",
      "description": "A fire-type creature",
      "creature_type": "fire",
      "hp": 40,
      "max_hp": 40,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 13,
      "sp_attack": 11,
      "sp_defense": 13,
      "speed": 11,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    },
    "dumbird": {
      "display_name": "Dumbird",
      "description": "A normal-type creature",
      "creature_type": "normal",
      "hp": 17,
      "max_hp": 17,
      "attack": 7,
      "defense": 9,
      "sp_attack": 7,
      "sp_defense": 4,
      "speed": 17,
      "skills": ["tackle"]
    }
  }
}
```

This change updates the Dumbird's `creature_type` from "leaf" back to "normal" and also updates its description to reflect this change. The rest of the file remains the same.

This modification addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing by ensuring that Dumbird is correctly classified as a "normal" type creature, which is consistent with the architecture document. This change will now properly interact with the type effectiveness system implemented in the game logic.

No changes are required in the `models.py` file or any other files, as the existing implementation already handles different creature types correctly. The game logic in `main_game_scene.py` will now use the correct type for Dumbird when calculating type effectiveness in battles, which is consistent with the architecture document stating that "Normal" type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

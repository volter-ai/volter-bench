Content: To address the issues raised in the QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement a skill queue for both the player and the foe.
2. Explicitly remove skills from the queue in the Resolution Phase.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll implement these changes:

1. Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the skills chosen by both the player and the foe.
2. Modify the choice phases to add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the resolution phase to use and remove skills from the queue.
4. Add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the state of creatures, and call it when transitioning out of the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b4a73fdf-89c6-4ba0-a738-56e074c096c4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.damage} damage" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.skill_queue.clear()  # Clear the skill queue at the start of each turn
            
            # Player Choice Phase

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(skill_choice.thing)

        self.skill_queue.append(skill_choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        for skill in self.skill_queue:
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.foe_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.skill_queue.clear()  # Clear the skill queue after resolution

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. We now have a `skill_queue` that explicitly stores the skills chosen by both the player and the foe.
2. Skills are removed from the queue after they are used in the resolution phase, and the queue is cleared at the end of each turn.
3. The `reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`, ensuring that the state of the player's (and foe's) creatures is reset.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

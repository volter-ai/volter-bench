Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to update the creature type for Dumbird from "normal" to "leaf" in the creature prototypes. This change will ensure consistency with the type relationships described in the architecture and will correctly affect the type effectiveness system.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `main_game/content/creature.json` file to change the `creature_type` of Dumbird from "normal" to "leaf".

2. We don't need to change any other files because the models and game logic are already set up to handle the different creature types correctly.

Now, let's rewrite the `creature.json` file with this change:

# Excerpt ID: 0dd26d12-857c-47e5-b80a-37f76b1e820a
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water-type creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 32,
      "max_hp": 32,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 10,
      "sp_attack": 12,
      "sp_defense": 12,
      "speed": 13,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard",
      "description": "A fire-type creature",
      "creature_type": "fire",
      "hp": 40,
      "max_hp": 40,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 13,
      "sp_attack": 11,
      "sp_defense": 13,
      "speed": 11,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    },
    "dumbird": {
      "display_name": "Dumbird",
      "description": "A leaf-type creature",
      "creature_type": "leaf",
      "hp": 17,
      "max_hp": 17,
      "attack": 7,
      "defense": 9,
      "sp_attack": 7,
      "sp_defense": 4,
      "speed": 17,
      "skills": ["tackle"]
    }
  }
}
```

This change updates the Dumbird's `creature_type` from "normal" to "leaf" and also updates its description to reflect this change. The rest of the file remains the same.

This modification addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing by ensuring that Dumbird is correctly classified as a "leaf" type creature. This change will now properly interact with the type effectiveness system implemented in the game logic.

No changes are required in the `models.py` file or any other files, as the existing implementation already handles different creature types correctly. The game logic in `main_game_scene.py` will now use the correct type for Dumbird when calculating type effectiveness in battles.

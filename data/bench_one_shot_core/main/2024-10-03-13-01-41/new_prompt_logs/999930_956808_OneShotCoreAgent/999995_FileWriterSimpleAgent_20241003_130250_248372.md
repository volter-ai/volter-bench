Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` test is failing because the game is not properly ending or transitioning after the main game scene.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `game_loop` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns `True` when the battle is over.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 939396a8-136f-4905-bd41-d7e5d1af3f68
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} uses {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that:

1. The `MainGameScene` properly transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends.
2. The creatures' HP is reset after each battle.
3. The game loop exits correctly when a battle ends.

These modifications should fix the failing tests and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

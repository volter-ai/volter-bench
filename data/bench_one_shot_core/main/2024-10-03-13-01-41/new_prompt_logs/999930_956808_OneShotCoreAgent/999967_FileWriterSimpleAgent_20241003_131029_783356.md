Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address these problems while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the models as pure data schemas. Here's how I'll fix the issues:

1. Explicitly reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene:
   - We'll add a method to reset creature states at the end of the battle, including resetting HP and removing any battle-specific attributes.

2. Use a more precise rounding method for the final damage calculation:
   - We'll use the `round()` function instead of `int()` to ensure proper rounding of the final damage.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health and their battle states have been reset.")
```

The main changes in this file are:

1. We've renamed the `reset_creatures` method to `reset_creatures_state` to better reflect its purpose.

2. In the `reset_creatures_state` method, we now reset the HP to max_hp and remove the `chosen_skill` attribute if it exists. This ensures that all battle-specific states are cleared.

3. We call `self.reset_creatures_state()` at the end of the `run` method to ensure creature states are reset when leaving the scene.

4. In the `calculate_damage` method, we've replaced `int()` with `round()` for more precise rounding of the final damage.

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing while maintaining the integrity of the model structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

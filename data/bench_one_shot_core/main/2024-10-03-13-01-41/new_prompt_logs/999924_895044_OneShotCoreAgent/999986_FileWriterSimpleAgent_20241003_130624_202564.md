Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - In the `end_battle` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll add a call to reset the HP of both the player's and opponent's creatures to their maximum HP before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

2. Remove the minimum damage of 1 in the damage calculation:
   - In the `calculate_damage` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll remove the `max(1, final_damage)` call and simply return the calculated `final_damage`.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the updated file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 3816d44d-09cd-4702-af31-0baf2578c545
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.current_turn += 1
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `reset_creatures` method is called in the `end_battle` method, which resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum HP before transitioning out of the MainGameScene.
2. The minimum damage of 1 has been removed from the `calculate_damage` method, allowing for the possibility of 0 damage as per the original architecture specifications.

These modifications ensure that the implementation adheres to the requirements specified in the architecture documents and resolves the issues identified during QA/testing.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Adjust the damage calculation to strictly follow the architecture specifications:
   - For physical skills: `[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`
   - For special skills: `[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]`

2. Remove the handling of negative damage. The architecture doesn't specify how to handle negative damage, so we'll allow it.

3. Remove any additional messages that were not specified in the architecture.

4. Ensure that all calculations are done using floats and only converted to integers for the final damage value.

Here's the updated `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: d4a8f285-8513-4ea6-a2c7-74668832c900
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The damage calculation now strictly follows the architecture specifications for both physical and special skills.
2. Negative damage is now allowed, as the architecture doesn't specify how to handle it.
3. Additional messages that were not specified in the architecture have been removed.
4. All calculations are done using floats and only converted to integers for the final damage value.

These modifications ensure that the implementation adheres more closely to the requirements specified in the architecture documents and resolves the issues identified during QA/testing.

Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to explicitly implement a queue for skills and remove them from the queue as they are executed. This aligns with the described architecture in the scene logic.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the queued skills.
2. We'll modify the choice phases to add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. We'll update the resolution phase to use and remove skills from the queue.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 64a4ee85-f986-4fc0-96f9-db655959cfed
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
                self.foe_creature.hp = max(0, self.foe_creature.hp - skill.damage)
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - skill.damage)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

These changes address the issue raised during QA/testing:

1. We've added a `skill_queue` attribute to store the queued skills.
2. The `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods now add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them.
3. The `resolution_phase` method now uses a while loop to process and remove skills from the queue one by one.
4. We've added a `clear()` call to the `skill_queue` in the `reset_creatures` method to ensure it's empty at the start of each battle.

These modifications align the implementation with the described architecture, explicitly using a queue for skills and removing them from the queue as they are executed. The rest of the game logic remains intact, ensuring that the battle flow and creature interactions work as intended.

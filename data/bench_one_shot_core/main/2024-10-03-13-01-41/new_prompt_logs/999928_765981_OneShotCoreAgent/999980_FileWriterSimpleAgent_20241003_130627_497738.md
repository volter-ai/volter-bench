Content: Thank you for providing the additional information about the issue. I understand that we need to reset the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. Description of the fix:
   We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' state before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this reset logic within the scene itself. We'll create a helper method in the MainGameScene class to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value for both the player and the opponent.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7fc69052-315a-4c1d-8331-407767a8ebe3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True

        # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
        self.reset_creatures_state()

        # After the battle ends, transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding a `reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum values. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and model structure. It doesn't add any methods or properties to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

This JSON object specifies that the action to be performed is an "overwrite" on the file located at "main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py" for the excerpt with the ID "7fc69052-315a-4c1d-8331-407767a8ebe3". This matches the proposed changes to the MainGameScene file.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement a random tie-breaker for equal speed scenarios in skill execution order.
2. Explicitly use floats in damage calculations before converting to integers.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've added a random tie-breaker for equal speed scenarios by including `random.random()` in the sorting key.
2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, we now explicitly use floats for all calculations before converting the final result to an integer.
3. We've added a new `_reset_creature_states` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

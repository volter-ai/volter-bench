## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The main problem is that the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2c7dec35-3ab0-475a-bde5-e46b7740431b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop continues until the battle ends.
2. Transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
3. Resetting the creatures' HP after the battle.
4. Using the `_transition_to_scene` method to properly exit the `MainGameScene`.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene exits properly, following the engine's architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

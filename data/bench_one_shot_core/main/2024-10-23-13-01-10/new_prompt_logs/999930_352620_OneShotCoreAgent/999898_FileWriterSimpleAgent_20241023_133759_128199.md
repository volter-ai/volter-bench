## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state after a battle, we need to implement this functionality in the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' state in the MainGameScene class.
2. We'll call this method at the end of each battle, before presenting the "Play Again" or "Quit" options.
3. The reset method will restore the HP of all creatures to their max_hp value.

Since we can't add methods to the models (as they should be pure data schemas), we'll implement this logic in the scene itself. Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4167248d-7a3a-41ba-865a-133ccb81cd35
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a new `_reset_creatures_state` method that restores all creatures' HP to their max_hp value.
2. Calling this method in the `run` method, right after `_check_battle_end` returns True and before `_end_battle` is called.
3. Showing a message to the player that all creatures have been restored to full health.

These changes ensure that the creatures' state is reset after each battle, maintaining the correct game logic as specified in the architecture documentation. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

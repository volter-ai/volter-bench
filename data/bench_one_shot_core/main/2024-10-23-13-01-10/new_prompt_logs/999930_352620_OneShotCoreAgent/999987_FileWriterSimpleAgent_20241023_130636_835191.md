## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the state of the player's creatures upon transitioning out of the Main Game Scene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1606fc44-f960-4fde-b182-13dd076380b5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            if player_skill is None:  # Player chose to quit
                self.reset_creatures_state()
                return

            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()

            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures_state()
                return

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return None

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds the `reset_creatures_state()` method to the MainGameScene class. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. The method is called just before transitioning out of the scene, either when the battle ends or when the player chooses to quit.

This implementation adheres to the guidelines and architecture while addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. It ensures that the state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of the Main Game Scene, as specified in the requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

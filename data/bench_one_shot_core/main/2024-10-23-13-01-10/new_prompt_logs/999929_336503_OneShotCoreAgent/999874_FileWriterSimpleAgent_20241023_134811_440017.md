## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' and 'MainGameScene' in the App class. The problem is that these scene classes are not imported in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll import the necessary scene classes in the main.py file.
2. We'll ensure that all imports are at the top of the file to avoid circular import issues.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8d0d7dcc-fb0d-476e-8bb4-2595302c75ad
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # Initialize active_creature with the first creature in the list
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # Initialize active_creature with the first creature in the list
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution imports the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes from their respective modules. By doing this, we ensure that these classes are available when the App class is initialized, resolving the NameError.

The changes made are:

1. Added import statements for MainMenuScene and MainGameScene at the top of the file.
2. Kept the existing structure of the App class and its methods.
3. Maintained the pure data schema nature of the models by not modifying the models.py file.

These changes should resolve the NameError while maintaining the structure and capabilities of the engine. The scene classes are now properly imported and should be recognized when registering them in the App class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

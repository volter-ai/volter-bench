## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement a queue for skill execution:
   - Create a list to store the queued skills for both the player and the opponent.
   - Add the selected skills to the queue during the choice phases.
   - Execute the skills from the queue during the resolution phase.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the scene:
   - Add a method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.
   - Call this method before transitioning to another scene.

Here's the updated `MainGameScene` implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 26f4f029-775e-4f46-a73a-416c7837514e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            self.skill_queue = []  # Reset skill queue at the start of each turn
            
            # Player Choice Phase
            if not self._player_turn():
                return

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self._opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                return

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return False

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, skill_choice.thing))
        return True

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, skill_choice.thing))

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        for attacker, skill in self.skill_queue:
            target = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
            self._apply_damage(attacker, skill, target)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. It now uses a queue (`self.skill_queue`) to store the skills selected by both the player and the opponent. The skills are then executed in order during the resolution phase.

2. A new `_reset_creatures` method has been added, which resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. This method is called before transitioning out of the scene when the battle ends.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns more closely with the described architecture and logic, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

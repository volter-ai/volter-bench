## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The current implementation doesn't handle the case where creatures have the same speed, which should result in a random order of skill execution. I'll describe how to fix this and then provide the updated MainGameScene file.

1. Description of the fix:

We'll modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class to handle the case where creatures have the same speed. When this occurs, we'll use Python's random.choice function to randomly determine which creature goes first. This aligns with the architecture document's description of the Resolution Phase.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the fix implemented:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

            return "player_win"
        return None
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed. When speeds are equal, it randomly chooses which creature attacks first, aligning with the architecture document's description. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

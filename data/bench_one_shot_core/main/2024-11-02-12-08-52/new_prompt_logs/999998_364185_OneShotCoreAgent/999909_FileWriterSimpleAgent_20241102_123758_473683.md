## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue:

1. To fix the issue of missing random decision for equal speed in skill execution order, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first in that case.

Here's how we'll fix it:

- In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
- If the speeds are equal, we'll use `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.
- We'll then execute the skills in the order determined by this logic.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e55f6f4b-1b68-451b-b6db-6cc87dd1e062
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if quit_button == choice:

            elif play_again_button == choice:

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, creature_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where both creatures have equal speed by randomly determining which one goes first. This adds an element of fairness and unpredictability to the game when speeds are equal, addressing the issue raised in the QA pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

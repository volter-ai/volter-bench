## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The implementation is missing the random resolution when creatures have the same speed. I'll describe how to fix this and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:
   To implement the random resolution when creatures have the same speed, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check to see if the speeds are equal, and if so, use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first. This aligns with the architecture document and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the fix implemented:

# Excerpt ID: 32c5c902-0784-4446-b965-b0187a15dba4

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def _handle_battle_end(self):

        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        
        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated implementation now includes the random resolution when creatures have the same speed, as specified in the architecture document. The `_resolution_phase` method now has three cases:

1. When the player's creature is faster
2. When the opponent's creature is faster
3. When both creatures have the same speed (new case)

In the third case, we use `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature attacks first, ensuring that each creature has an equal chance of going first when their speeds are equal. This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Players** manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creatures** are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's resistance to damage against attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | 10 hp | 3 attack | 2 defense | 4 speed | Skills: tackle
- "Scizard" | 11 hp | 3 attack | 3 defense | 3 speed | Skills: tackle

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" | Has a bubwool
- "Basic Opponent" | Has a scizard

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```
The calculated damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### General Game Structure
- [x] The game includes a **MainMenuScene** where the player can choose to play or quit. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`)
- [x] The game includes a **MainGameScene** where the player battles against a bot opponent. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)

### Game Entities
- [x] The game has a **Player** entity that can be controlled by a human or a bot. (Verified in `main_game/models.py`)
- [x] The **Player** entity has a collection of creatures at their disposal. (Verified in `main_game/models.py`)
- [x] The game has a **Creature** entity that participates in battles. (Verified in `main_game/models.py`)
- [x] The **Creature** entity has attributes: `hp`, `max_hp`, `attack`, `defense`, `speed`, and `skills`. (Verified in `main_game/models.py`)
- [x] The game has a **Skill** entity representing actions creatures can take in battle. (Verified in `main_game/models.py`)
- [x] The **Skill** entity has an attribute `base_damage`. (Verified in `main_game/models.py`)

### Creature Prototypes
- [x] The game includes a creature prototype "Bubwool" with 10 hp, 3 attack, 2 defense, 4 speed, and the skill "tackle". (Verified in `main_game/content/creature.json`)
- [x] The game includes a creature prototype "Scizard" with 11 hp, 3 attack, 3 defense, 3 speed, and the skill "tackle". (Verified in `main_game/content/creature.json`)

### Player Prototypes
- [x] The game includes a player prototype "Default Player" that has a Bubwool. (Verified in `main_game/content/player.json`)
- [x] The game includes a player prototype "Basic Opponent" that has a Scizard. (Verified in `main_game/content/player.json`)

### Skill Prototypes
- [x] The game includes a skill prototype "Tackle" with 3 damage. (Verified in `main_game/content/skill.json`)

### MainMenuScene Logic
- [x] The Main Menu scene displays a welcome message. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` - `__str__` method)
- [x] The Main Menu scene prompts the player to play or quit. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` - `game_loop` method)
- [x] Choosing to play takes the player to the **MainGameScene**. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` - `game_loop` method)
- [x] Choosing to quit exits the game. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` - `game_loop` method)

### MainGameScene Logic
- [x] The Main Game Scene allows a human player to battle against a bot player. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`)
- [x] The scene consists of repeating turns with distinct phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `game_loop` method)

#### Player Choice Phase
- [x] The player is shown their creature's list of available skills. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `__str__` method)
- [x] The player can choose one skill to queue for the resolution phase. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `player_choice_phase` method)

#### Foe Choice Phase
- [x] The opposing player (bot) is shown their creature's list of available skills. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `foe_choice_phase` method)
- [x] The bot chooses one skill to queue for the resolution phase. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `foe_choice_phase` method)

#### Resolution Phase
- [x] Skills queued in the previous phases are resolved. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `resolution_phase` method)
- [x] The order of skill execution depends on the speed of the creatures. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `resolution_phase` method)
- [x] If creatures have the same speed, the order is decided randomly. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `resolution_phase` method)

##### Skill Execution
- [x] Damage is calculated as `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `execute_skill` method)
- [x] The calculated damage is subtracted from the defender's hp. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `execute_skill` method)

#### Battle End Condition
- [x] The battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `check_battle_end` method)
- [x] A message is shown informing the player of the outcome: win or lose. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `run` method)
- [x] If the player's creature is defeated, they are informed they are the loser. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `check_battle_end` method)
- [x] If the opponent's creature is defeated, the player is informed they are the winner. (Verified in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` - `check_battle_end` method)

### Additional Observations
- The code seems to implement all the described features and logic correctly according to the architecture documents.
- There are no extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.
- The tests provided in `main_game/tests` seem to cover the main scenarios, including random runs for both the main menu and main game scenes.

Overall, the code in the `main_game` folder appears to be consistent with the architecture documentation provided.

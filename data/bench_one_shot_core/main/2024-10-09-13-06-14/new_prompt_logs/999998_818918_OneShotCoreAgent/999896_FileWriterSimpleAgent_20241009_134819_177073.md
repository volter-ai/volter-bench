## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both problems: the tie-breaking for equal speed and the handling of the 'Normal' type in the type effectiveness calculation.

1. To fix these issues, I will:

   a) Modify the `resolve_turn` method in the MainGameScene to randomly choose which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
   
   b) Update the `get_type_factor` method to correctly handle the 'Normal' type, which should always return 1 regardless of the defender's type.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The modifications will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type.lower() == "normal":
            return 1
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `resolve_turn` method now handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly choosing which creature goes first.
2. The `get_type_factor` method now correctly handles the 'Normal' type by always returning 1, regardless of the defender's type.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

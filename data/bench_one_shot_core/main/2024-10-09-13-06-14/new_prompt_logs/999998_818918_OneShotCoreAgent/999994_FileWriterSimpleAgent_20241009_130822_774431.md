## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes:

1. Implement a queue for skill execution in the MainGameScene:
   - Add a queue to store the skills chosen by both players.
   - Modify the resolution phase to execute skills from the queue.

2. Implement a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - Add a method to reset creature HP to its max value.
   - Call this method when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene implementation:

# Excerpt ID: c561298e-7c2c-4e8f-b7be-088aebd0a53d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._player_choice_phase()
            self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase()

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, skill_choice.thing))

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, skill_choice.thing))

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s creature took {skill.damage} damage!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{defender.display_name}'s creature took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. It implements a queue (`self.skill_queue`) for skill execution. Skills are added to the queue during the choice phases and executed in order during the resolution phase.

2. It adds a `_reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max value. This method is called when transitioning out of the MainGameScene (in the `_check_battle_end` method).

These changes ensure that the game follows the described architecture more closely and properly resets the state when returning to the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

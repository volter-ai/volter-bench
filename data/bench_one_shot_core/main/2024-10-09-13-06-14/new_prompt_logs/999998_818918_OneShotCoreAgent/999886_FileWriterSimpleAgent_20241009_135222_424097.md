## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly ends the game when a battle is concluded. The error message indicates that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the `run` method, we'll check if the battle has ended after each player's turn.
3. If the battle has ended, we'll call `self._quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 109df37b-d641-4c1a-ab93-4d3ead22df02
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def get_player_action(self, player):
        attack_button = Button("Attack")
        swap_button = Button("Swap")
        choices = [attack_button, swap_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)

    def get_swap_choice(self, player):
        choices = [SelectThing(creature) for creature in player.creatures if creature != player.active_creature and creature.hp > 0]
        if not choices:

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.player.creatures):

            return True

        # Check if any player has no creatures left to swap
        for current_player in [self.player, self.opponent]:
            if current_player.active_creature.hp == 0 and all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in current_player.creatures if creature != current_player.active_creature):
                winner = self.opponent if current_player == self.player else self.player
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} won the battle!")
                return True
        
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the game properly ends when a battle is concluded. The `run` method now checks if the battle has ended after each player's turn and calls `self._quit_whole_game()` if it has. This should resolve the FixableException and allow the game to terminate correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to continue the battle loop until a winner is determined.
2. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll also add an option to quit the game after the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 914440e6-3472-4a6d-8a41-536fb10eaaf1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game. The main changes are:

1. The `run` method now uses a `while` loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. After the battle ends, we call the new `end_battle` method.
3. The `end_battle` method gives the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
4. Depending on the player's choice, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, fixing the issues in both the `test_main_game_scene_random_run` and `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` tests.

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these discrepancies, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix each issue:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Implement action execution order based on speed.
3. Add forced swapping when a creature's hp reaches zero.
4. Reset the state of the player's creatures upon leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. The models will remain as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

    def get_opponent(self, player):
        return self.opponent if player == self.player else self.player
```

This implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the attack and swap choice methods.
2. Action execution order is now based on the speed of the creatures.
3. Forced swapping is implemented when a creature's HP reaches zero.
4. The state of the player's creatures is reset upon leaving the scene.

The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, with all game logic contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

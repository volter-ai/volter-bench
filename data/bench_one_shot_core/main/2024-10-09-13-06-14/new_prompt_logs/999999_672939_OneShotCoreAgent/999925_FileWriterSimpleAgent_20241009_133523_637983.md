## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the MainGameScene to perform damage calculations with floats as specified in the architecture. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `execute_skill` method to use floats for all damage calculations.
2. We'll only convert the final damage to an integer at the very end of the calculation.
3. We'll update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to return floats instead of integers.

Here's the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `execute_skill` method to use floats for all damage calculations. We convert the `attack`, `base_damage`, and `defense` values to floats before performing the calculations.
2. Only converting the final damage to an integer at the very end of the calculation, just before subtracting it from the defender's HP.
3. Updating the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to return floats (2.0, 0.5, 1.0) instead of integers.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture, performing damage calculations with floats as specified. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the MainGameScene.

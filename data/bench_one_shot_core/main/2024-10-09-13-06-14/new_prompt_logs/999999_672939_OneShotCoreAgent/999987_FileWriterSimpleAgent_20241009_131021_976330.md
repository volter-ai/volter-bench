## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' state upon transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this reset functionality within the scene itself.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a new method called `_reset_creatures_state` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `run` method.

This approach ensures that the creatures' state is reset without modifying the models, staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 173aba01-446d-4a11-9ccd-cd81697fae5d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
        self._reset_creatures_state()

        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_skill(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        self._apply_skill(self.opponent, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_skill(self, user: Player, skill: Skill, target: Creature):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{user.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{user.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` addresses the issue by resetting the state of all creatures for both the player and the opponent before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`. The `_reset_creatures_state` method ensures that all creatures' HP is restored to their maximum value, fulfilling the requirement mentioned in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `get_swap_action` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures of a player are either knocked out or the active creature is the only one with HP remaining.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `get_swap_action` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to. If not, we'll return None.
2. In the `player_turn` method, we'll handle the case where `get_swap_action` returns None by skipping the turn.
3. We'll also add a check in the `check_battle_end` method to end the battle if a player has no creatures left with HP.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e9ca33a3-f202-45dd-a056-95b9a5ff515a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent.active_creature.hp}/{self.opponent.active_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        while True:
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
            self.player_turn(self.player)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
            self.player_turn(self.opponent)

    def player_turn(self, current_player):
        action = self.get_player_action(current_player)
        if action is not None:
            self.resolve_action(current_player, action)
        else:
            self._show_text(current_player, f"{current_player.display_name} has no available actions!")

    def get_player_action(self, player):
        attack_button = Button("Attack")
        swap_button = Button("Swap")
        choices = [attack_button, swap_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)

        if choice == attack_button:
            return self.get_attack_action(player)
        elif choice == swap_button:
            return self.get_swap_action(player)

    def get_attack_action(self, player):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in player.active_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)

    def get_swap_action(self, player):
        choices = [SelectThing(creature) for creature in player.creatures if creature != player.active_creature and creature.hp > 0]
        if not choices:
            self._show_text(player, f"{player.display_name} has no creatures to swap to!")
            return None
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)

    def resolve_action(self, attacker, action):
        defender = self.player if attacker == self.opponent else self.opponent

            self.resolve_attack(attacker, defender, action.thing)

    def resolve_attack(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker.active_creature, defender.active_creature, skill)
        defender.active_creature.hp = max(0, defender.active_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker.active_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender.active_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def swap_creature(self, player, new_creature):
        player.active_creature = new_creature
        self._show_text(player, f"Swapped to {new_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        return max(1, final_damage)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.player.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.opponent.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issue by:

1. Handling the case where there are no creatures available to swap to in the `get_swap_action` method.
2. Skipping the turn if no action is available in the `player_turn` method.
3. Ensuring that the battle ends if a player has no creatures left with HP in the `check_battle_end` method.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the MainGameScene to handle the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method called `determine_turn_order` that will return a tuple of (first_attacker, second_attacker) based on their speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select the first attacker.
3. We'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to use this new `determine_turn_order` method.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e7395145-b3f8-401f-9097-24fc17228416
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a new `determine_turn_order` method that handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first.
2. Modifying the `resolution_phase` method to use the new `determine_turn_order` method, ensuring that the turn order is correctly determined based on speed, with a random decision in case of a tie.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture, handling the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the MainGameScene.

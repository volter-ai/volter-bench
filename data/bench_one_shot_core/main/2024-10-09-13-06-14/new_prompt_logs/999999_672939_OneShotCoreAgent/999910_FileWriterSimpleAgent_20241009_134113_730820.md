## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.
2. We'll update the game loop to break and transition to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 9eb736f3-38af-4643-a82d-f1a4c342e638
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop breaks when the battle ends.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that shows the battle result and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Calling `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the battle, which should resolve the issue of the scene not exiting properly.

These modifications should fix the test failures while maintaining the game's structure and adhering to the engine's capabilities. The models remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas inheriting from the appropriate abstract classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue and will address it by modifying the MainGameScene. Here's how I plan to fix the problems:

1. Add randomization for skill execution order when speeds are equal:
   - In the resolution_phase method, we'll add a condition to randomly choose the order of skill execution when the speeds are equal.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now use `random.choice([True, False])` to randomly determine the order of skill execution when the speeds are equal.

2. We've added a new `reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum HP. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

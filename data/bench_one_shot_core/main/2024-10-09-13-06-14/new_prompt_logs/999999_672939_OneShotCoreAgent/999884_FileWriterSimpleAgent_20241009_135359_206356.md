## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to properly end the game when a player loses. The main problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and if so, which player won.
2. In the `run` method, we'll use this information to call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends.
3. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP at the end of the battle, as mentioned in the scene requirements.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `check_battle_end` method to return both whether the battle has ended and which player won.
2. Using this information in the `run` method to properly end the game by calling `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends.
3. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to restore all creatures' HP at the end of the battle.

These changes ensure that the scene always terminates properly by calling `_quit_whole_game()`, which should resolve the FixableException we were seeing. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

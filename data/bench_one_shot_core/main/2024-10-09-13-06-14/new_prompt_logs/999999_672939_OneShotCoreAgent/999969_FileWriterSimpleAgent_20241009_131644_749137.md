## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`, which is required by the engine to properly end or transition between scenes.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method to continue running until the player chooses to quit or play again.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 4468047e-4642-4d21-a141-2cb2fa8dc646
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                if not self.play_again():
                    break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
            return False
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return False
        return True
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` addresses the issue by ensuring that the scene always ends with either a transition to another scene or by quitting the game. The `play_again` method is called after each battle ends, giving the player the option to play again or return to the main menu. This approach ensures that the scene loop continues until an appropriate transition or quit action is taken, resolving the FixableException we encountered earlier.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

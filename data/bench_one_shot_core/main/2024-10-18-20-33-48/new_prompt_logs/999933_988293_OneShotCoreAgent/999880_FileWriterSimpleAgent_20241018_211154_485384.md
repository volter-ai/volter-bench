## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the choice.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. In the `player_choice_phase` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns None by offering only the "Attack" option.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and respects the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the "Swap" option is only offered when there are creatures available to swap, and handling the case where no swap is possible without causing an error. The `player_choice_phase` method now checks if there are creatures to swap before offering the "Swap" option, and the `choose_swap` method returns None if there are no available creatures to swap to.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

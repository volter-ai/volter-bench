## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the speed-based turn order and random order for creatures with the same speed. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to implement a turn order system based on creature speed.
2. We'll create a method to determine the turn order at the start of each round.
3. We'll adjust the main battle loop to follow this turn order.
4. If creatures have the same speed, we'll use random.shuffle to determine their order.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes implemented:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        if choice == return_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Introducing a `_determine_turn_order` method that sorts creatures based on their speed and randomizes the order if speeds are equal.
2. Modifying the main battle loop to use this turn order for each round.
3. Adapting the turn execution to work with either the player's creature or the opponent's creature based on the determined order.

These changes ensure that the battle follows the speed-based turn order as described in the architecture, while still maintaining the existing game structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

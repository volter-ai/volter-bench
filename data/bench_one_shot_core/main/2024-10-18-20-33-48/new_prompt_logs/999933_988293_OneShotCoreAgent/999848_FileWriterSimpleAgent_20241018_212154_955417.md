## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Implement random turn order for creatures with the same speed.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, I'll add a 'Back' button that allows the player to return to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.
2. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when creatures have the same speed.
3. I'll add a new method `_reset_creatures_state` that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP, and call this method before transitioning back to the main menu.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. A 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choice phases, allowing players to return to the main choice.
2. Random turn order for creatures with the same speed is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method by adding a random factor to the sorting key.
3. The `_reset_creatures_state` method has been added to reset the HP of all creatures when leaving the scene, and it's called before transitioning back to the main menu.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and don't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The implementation now fully adheres to the described architecture and should pass the QA testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when a player tries to swap their creature, but there are no available creatures to swap to (all other creatures have fainted).

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before calling `_wait_for_choice`.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None instead of trying to make a choice.
3. In the `player_choice_phase` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns None by forcing the player to choose an attack instead.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 0bf9d19c-7d52-4deb-b8e9-8031cf88262c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. If a player tries to swap but has no available creatures to swap to, they will be forced to choose an attack instead.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing logic for randomly deciding which creature goes first when their speeds are equal during the resolution phase, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this:

1. In the `resolve_turn` method, I will add a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
2. If the speeds are equal, I will use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly select which creature goes first.
3. I will then execute the skills based on this random selection.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models or overall architecture.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed fix:

```

This updated implementation now includes the logic for randomly deciding which creature goes first when their speeds are equal during the resolution phase. The `resolve_turn` method now has a new condition that checks if the speeds are equal, and if so, it uses `random.choice` to randomly select the order of skill execution. This change fully implements the specified game logic while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

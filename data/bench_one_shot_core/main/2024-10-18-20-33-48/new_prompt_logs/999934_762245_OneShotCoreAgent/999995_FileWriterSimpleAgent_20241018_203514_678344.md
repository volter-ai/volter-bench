## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a loop in the run method of MainGameScene to allow for multiple battles.
3. We'll add an option to quit the game after each battle.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f386359c-8843-4f1b-a6bb-0b6cad91cfae
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._start_new_battle()
            while True:
                player_skill = self._player_turn()
                opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

                self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

                if self._check_battle_end():
                    break

            self._reset_creatures()
            
            # Ask if the player wants to play again or quit
            play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])
            
            if choice == quit_button:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _start_new_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You encounter {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        damage = skill.damage
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lose the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has been defeated!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "You win the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a main game loop in the `run` method that allows for multiple battles.
2. Introducing a choice after each battle to either play again or quit.
3. Properly transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the player chooses to quit.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The changes are confined to the MainGameScene, which is responsible for the game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

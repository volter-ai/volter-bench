## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for overlooking this important aspect of the game mechanics. I'll address this issue by implementing the correct turn order based on creature speed and adding a random decision for speed ties.

Here's how I plan to fix the issue:

1. Modify the `MainGameScene` class to implement a turn order system based on creature speed.
2. Add a method to compare creature speeds and determine the order of actions.
3. Implement a random decision mechanism for speed ties.
4. Restructure the main battle loop to accommodate the new turn order system.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8269f5cc-7ec3-49d9-aed2-1489a95d2232
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.reset_battle()

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
                break

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

        self.player_skill = choice.thing

    def _opponent_choose_skill(self):

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        first, second = self._determine_turn_order()

    def _determine_turn_order(self):

            return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It deals {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0

            return 2.0

        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Separating the skill selection phase from the execution phase for both player and opponent.
2. Introducing a `_determine_turn_order` method that compares creature speeds and randomly decides the order in case of a tie.
3. Implementing a `_resolve_turn` method that executes skills in the correct order based on speed.
4. Maintaining the existing model structure and adhering to the engine's capabilities.

These changes ensure that the game now correctly implements the turn order based on creature speed and handles speed ties with a random decision, as specified in the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game when it should.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a check in the main game loop to break out of the loop when the battle ends.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and the game terminates as expected.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 96df7fb4-f9bd-427a-9b98-b4faf6627496
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name}:

        new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing
        self._perform_swap(player, new_creature)
        return True
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle has ended.
2. Modifying the main game loop in the `run` method to break when `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to set `battle_ended` to True when the battle ends.
4. Adding a call to `self._quit_whole_game()` at the end of the `run` method to ensure the game exits properly.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly when the battle ends and that the game terminates as expected. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

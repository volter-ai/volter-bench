## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not implementing the random order resolution for skills when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll implement the solution:

   - We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - We'll then execute the skills in the determined order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture described in the documentation.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e682570a-7ca5-4c57-8dea-5b520d6bf2bd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                self.player, player_skill, self.opponent, opponent_skill
            )
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player, player_skill
            )
        else:
            # Random order when speeds are equal
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                    self.player, player_skill, self.opponent, opponent_skill
                )
            else:
                first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                    self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player, player_skill
                )

        self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_attacker.creatures[0], first_skill, second_attacker.creatures[0])
        if second_attacker.creatures[0].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_attacker.creatures[0], second_skill, first_attacker.creatures[0])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining the order of skill execution. The rest of the battle logic remains unchanged, ensuring that the game still follows the architecture and uses the models as defined.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

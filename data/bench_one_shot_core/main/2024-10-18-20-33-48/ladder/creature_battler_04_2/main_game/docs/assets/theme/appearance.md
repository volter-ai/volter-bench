# Theme Appearance

This document describes the general appearance of user interface elements in the game. Buttons, borders, and windows in the game should generally use simple, solid colors. They should not look realistic, and instead somewhat like something drawn in a cartoon or anime. This is to avoid making them visually overwhelming. Using black outlines for emphasis or to further improve visual clarity.

The color choices here should lean towards bright bubbly colors that pop out. We should try to limit our palette to about two colors.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit when the battle ends. Here's how we'll do it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll call this method in the _check_battle_end method when either player wins or loses.
3. We'll ensure that the run method continues the game loop until the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits when the battle ends by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This should resolve both issues:

1. The MainGameScene will now exit properly, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by allowing the player to quit the game from the MainMenuScene.
2. The whole game flow should now complete correctly, as the MainGameScene will properly transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas without methods or properties.

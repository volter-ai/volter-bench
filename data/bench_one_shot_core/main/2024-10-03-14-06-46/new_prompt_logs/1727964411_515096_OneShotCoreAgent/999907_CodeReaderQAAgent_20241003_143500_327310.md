# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Content: Here is an exhaustive checklist based on the provided architecture documents. Each item includes a citation to the relevant section of the architecture documentation:

### MainGameScene Logic

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - The game consists of repeating turns with distinct phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md` - "The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases."*

2. **Player Choice Phase:**
   - The player is shown their creature's list of available skills.
   - The player can choose one skill, which is queued for the resolution phase.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md` - "During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills."*

3. **Foe Choice Phase:**
   - The opposing player (bot) is shown their creature's list of available skills.
   - The bot chooses one skill, which is queued for the resolution phase.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md` - "During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills."*

4. **Resolution Phase:**
   - Skills queued in the previous phases are resolved.
   - Skills are executed based on the speed of the creature using the skill.
   - If creatures have the same speed, the order is decided randomly with equal chances.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md` - "During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved."*

5. **Skill Execution:**
   - Raw damage for physical skills: `[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`.
   - Raw damage for non-physical (special) skills: `[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]`.
   - Final damage: `[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]`.
   - Damage calculations are performed with floats and converted to an integer for final damage.
   - Final damage is subtracted from the defender's hp.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md` - "When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes."*

6. **Type Relationships:**
   - Weakness-resistance factor is determined by skill type vs. defender's creature type.
   - Effective skill type: factor is 2.
   - Ineffective skill type: factor is 1/2.
   - Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md` - "When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found."*

7. **Battle End Condition:**
   - Battle ends when a creature's hp reaches zero.
   - If player's creature is defeated, player is informed of loss.
   - If opponent's creature is defeated, player is informed of victory.
   - Player's creatures' state is reset when transitioning out of the scene.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md` - "At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends."*

### MainMenuScene Logic

8. **Main Menu Options:**
   - Player is shown a welcome message.
   - Player can choose to play the game or quit.
   - Choosing to play takes the player to the MainGameScene.
   - Choosing to quit exits the game.  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md` - "At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message."*

### Player Prototypes

9. **Default Player:**
   - Has creatures: ["bubwool"].  
     *Citation: `main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md` - "Default Player"*

10. **Basic Opponent:**
    - Has creatures: ["scizard"].  
      *Citation: `main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md` - "Basic Opponent"*

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainGameScene Logic

1. **Turn Structure:**
   - **Code Check:** The `MainGameScene` class in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` implements a loop in the `run` method that goes through the phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

2. **Player Choice Phase:**
   - **Code Check:** The `player_choice_phase` method shows the player's creature's skills and allows the player to choose one.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

3. **Foe Choice Phase:**
   - **Code Check:** The `foe_choice_phase` method randomly selects a skill for the opponent's creature.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

4. **Resolution Phase:**
   - **Code Check:** The `resolution_phase` method resolves the queued skills based on creature speed, with a random choice if speeds are equal.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

5. **Skill Execution:**
   - **Code Check:** The `_execute_skill` and `_calculate_damage` methods implement the damage calculation logic for both physical and special skills, including type effectiveness.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

6. **Type Relationships:**
   - **Code Check:** The `_get_type_factor` method implements the type effectiveness logic as described.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

7. **Battle End Condition:**
   - **Code Check:** The `_check_battle_end` method checks if a creature's hp reaches zero and displays the appropriate message. The `_reset_creatures` method resets the creatures' hp.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### MainMenuScene Logic

8. **Main Menu Options:**
   - **Code Check:** The `MainMenuScene` class in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` displays a welcome message and provides options to play or quit.  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Player Prototypes

9. **Default Player:**
   - **Code Check:** The `default_player` prototype in `main_game/content/player.json` includes the creature "bubwool".  
   - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

10. **Basic Opponent:**
    - **Code Check:** The `basic_opponent` prototype in `main_game/content/player.json` includes the creature "scizard".  
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Creature Prototypes

11. **Bubwool:**
    - **Code Check:** The `bubwool` prototype in `main_game/content/creature.json` matches the described attributes and skills.  
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

12. **Scizard:**
    - **Code Check:** The `scizard` prototype in `main_game/content/creature.json` matches the described attributes and skills.  
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Skill Prototypes

13. **Tackle:**
    - **Code Check:** The `tackle` prototype in `main_game/content/skill.json` matches the described attributes.  
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

14. **Fireball:**
    - **Code Check:** The `fireball` prototype in `main_game/content/skill.json` matches the described attributes.  
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

15. **Lick:**
    - **Code Check:** The `lick` prototype in `main_game/content/skill.json` matches the described attributes.  
    - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Additional Observations

- **Extra Implementations:** The code includes additional functionality for random mode testing and graceful exits, which are not described in the architecture documents but are useful for testing purposes.
- **No Discrepancies Found:** The code in the `main_game` folder aligns well with the described architecture, and all checklist items are correctly implemented.

Overall, the codebase appears to be well-aligned with the architecture documentation, with no discrepancies or missing elements.

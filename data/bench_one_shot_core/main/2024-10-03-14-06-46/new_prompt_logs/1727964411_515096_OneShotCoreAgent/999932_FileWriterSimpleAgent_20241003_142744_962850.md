Content: To address the issue of not implementing speed-based skill execution order and random selection in case of a tie during the resolution phase, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this:

1. Modify the `execute_skill` method to return the damage dealt instead of applying it directly.
2. Create a new method called `resolve_turn` that will:
   a. Determine the order of skill execution based on creature speeds.
   b. In case of a speed tie, randomly select which creature goes first.
   c. Execute the skills in the determined order.
3. Update the `game_loop` method to use the new `resolve_turn` method instead of separate player and opponent turns.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by introducing speed-based skill execution order and random selection in case of a tie during the resolution phase. The `resolve_turn` method now determines the order of skill execution based on creature speeds and uses random selection in case of a tie. The game loop has been simplified to use this new method, ensuring that the battle mechanics align with the architecture documentation.

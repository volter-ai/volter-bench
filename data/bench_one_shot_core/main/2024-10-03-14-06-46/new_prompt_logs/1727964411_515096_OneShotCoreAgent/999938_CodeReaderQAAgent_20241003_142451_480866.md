# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" | Has a bubwool
- "Basic Opponent" | Has a scizard

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | "water" type | 10 hp | 3 attack | 2 defense | 4 speed | Skills: ["Tackle", "Lick"]
- "Scizard" | "fire" type | 11 hp | 3 attack | 3 defense | 3 speed | Skills: ["Tackle", "Fireball"]
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" | "normal" type | 3 damage | "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
- "Fireball" | "fire" type | 2 damage | "Throw fire at a foe, dealing damage."
- "Lick" | "water" type | 2 damage | "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's resistance to damage against attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainGameScene Logic

1. **Player Choice Phase:**
   - **Check:** The player is shown their creature's list of available skills.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene.__str__` method displays the player's skills.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** The player can choose one skill to queue for the resolution phase.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._player_turn` method allows the player to choose a skill.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

2. **Foe Choice Phase:**
   - **Check:** The opposing player is shown their creature's list of available skills.
     - **Code:** The opponent's choice is made randomly in `MainGameScene._opponent_turn`.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented, as the bot chooses randomly.
   - **Check:** The opposing player can choose one skill to queue for the resolution phase.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._opponent_turn` method queues a skill for the opponent.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

3. **Resolution Phase:**
   - **Check:** Skills queued in the previous phases are resolved.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._resolve_turn` method resolves the skills.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** Skills are executed based on the speed of the creature using the skill.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._resolve_turn` method checks speed to determine order.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** If creatures have the same speed, the order is decided randomly with equal chances.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._resolve_turn` uses `random.choice` for equal speed.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

4. **Skill Execution:**
   - **Check:** Raw damage is calculated as: `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._execute_skill` calculates raw damage correctly.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** Final damage is calculated as: `[weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]`.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._execute_skill` calculates final damage correctly.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** Damage calculations are performed with floats and converted to an integer for final damage.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._execute_skill` uses `float` for raw damage and converts to `int`.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** Final damage is subtracted from the defender's hp.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._execute_skill` subtracts final damage from `defender_creature.hp`.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

5. **Type Relationships:**
   - **Check:** Effective skill type against creature type has a factor of 2.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._calculate_type_factor` returns 2.0 for effective types.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** Ineffective skill type against creature type has a factor of 1/2.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._calculate_type_factor` returns 0.5 for ineffective types.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** "Normal" type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._calculate_type_factor` returns 1.0 for "normal" type.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** "Fire" type is effective against "Leaf" and ineffective against "Water".
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._calculate_type_factor` implements this correctly.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** "Water" type is effective against "Fire" and ineffective against "Leaf".
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._calculate_type_factor` implements this correctly.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** "Leaf" type is effective against "Water" and ineffective against "Fire".
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._calculate_type_factor` implements this correctly.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

6. **Battle End Condition:**
   - **Check:** Battle ends when one creature's hp reaches zero.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._check_battle_end` checks for hp reaching zero.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** If the player's creature is defeated, they are informed they are the loser.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._check_battle_end` informs the player of loss.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** If the opponent's creature is defeated, the player is informed they are the winner.
     - **Code:** `MainGameScene._check_battle_end` informs the player of victory.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### MainMenuScene Logic

1. **Scene Start:**
   - **Check:** Player is shown a welcome message.
     - **Code:** `MainMenuScene.__str__` displays a welcome message.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** Player is prompted to play or quit.
     - **Code:** `MainMenuScene.run` provides options to play or quit.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

2. **Player Choices:**
   - **Check:** One choice takes the player to the MainGameScene.
     - **Code:** `MainMenuScene.run` transitions to "MainGameScene" on play.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.
   - **Check:** One choice quits the game entirely.
     - **Code:** `MainMenuScene.run` calls `_quit_whole_game` on quit.
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

### Player Prototypes

1. **Default Player:**
   - **Check:** Has a Bubwool creature.
     - **Code:** `main_game/content/player.json` assigns "bubwool" to "default_player".
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

2. **Basic Opponent:**
   - **Check:** Has a Scizard creature.
     - **Code:** `main_game/content/player.json` assigns "scizard" to "basic_opponent".
     - **Status:** Correctly implemented.

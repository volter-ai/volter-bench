Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is not properly exiting when the battle ends. We need to ensure that after the battle concludes, we either transition to another scene or quit the whole game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then transition back to the main menu.
3. We'll call this method when we detect that the battle has ended in the `_check_battle_end` method.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 65be5d17-4fa1-4961-8956-42dbcb8f9e9e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense

        effectiveness = {

            ("water", "fire"): 2,

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly. When the battle ends (either by the player winning or losing), the `_end_battle` method is called. This method displays the battle result and then transitions back to the main menu scene.

By adding this proper exit mechanism, we ensure that the scene doesn't terminate without calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which was the cause of the original error.

This change should resolve both test failures:
1. For the `test_main_game_scene_random_run`, the scene will now properly exit by transitioning back to the main menu.
2. For the `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots`, the `MainGameScene` will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene`, resolving the `FixableException`.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while fixing the identified issues.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle concludes.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends, ensuring that the game can be played multiple times.
3. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to return True when the battle is over, allowing the main game loop to exit properly.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 1e5182ca-02f0-41f5-b506-b4535bdbe561
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = "player"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

"""

    def _format_skills(self):
        if self.current_turn == "player":
            creature = self.player_creature
        else:
            creature = self.opponent_creature
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.current_turn == "player":
                self._player_turn()
            else:
                self._opponent_turn()
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            
            self.current_turn = "opponent" if self.current_turn == "player" else "player"

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop exits properly when a creature faints.
2. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
3. Resetting the creatures' HP after each battle, allowing for multiple playthroughs.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and allow the game to run smoothly through multiple iterations.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the choice.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. In the `player_turn` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None` by forcing the player to choose an attack instead.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the pure data schema nature of the models. Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        for player, action in actions:

        elif all(c.hp == 0 for c in self.bot.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the AssertionError we were encountering. By checking if there are available creatures to swap to before offering the choice, we ensure that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. If there are no creatures available to swap, the player is forced to choose an attack instead.

This solution maintains the game's logic while preventing the error condition. It also keeps the `Player` model as a pure data schema, as all the game logic remains within the `MainGameScene` class.

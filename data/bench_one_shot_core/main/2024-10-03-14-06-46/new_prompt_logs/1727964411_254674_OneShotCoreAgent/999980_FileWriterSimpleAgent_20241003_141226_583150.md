Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is not properly exiting when the battle ends. We need to ensure that the scene transitions to another scene or quits the game when the battle is over.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll move the battle logic into a separate method to make the main run loop clearer.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 970a98c1-d43c-4212-a4d5-ee544e92fc49
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            battle_result = self._run_battle()
            if battle_result:
                self._show_text(self.player, battle_result)
                self._prompt_after_battle()

    def _run_battle(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                return f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!"
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                return f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!"

    def _prompt_after_battle(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` or by quitting the whole game. The main `run` method now contains an infinite loop that will only be broken when the player chooses to quit or play again after a battle ends.

The battle logic has been moved to the `_run_battle` method, which returns a result string when the battle ends. This result is then displayed to the player before prompting them to play again or quit.

The `_prompt_after_battle` method handles the player's choice after a battle, ensuring that the scene always exits properly by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

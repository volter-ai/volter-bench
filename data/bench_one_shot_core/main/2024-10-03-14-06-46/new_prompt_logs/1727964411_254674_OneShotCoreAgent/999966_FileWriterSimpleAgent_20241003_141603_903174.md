Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. After the battle ends, we'll present the player with options to play again or quit.
3. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 9d67b920-3253-4be2-946e-fec505361b6e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.handle_battle_end()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")

        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. Presenting the player with options to play again or quit after the battle ends.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to return to the MainMenuScene if the player chooses to play again.
4. Using `_quit_whole_game` if the player chooses to quit.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve the test failures and allow the game to run as expected.

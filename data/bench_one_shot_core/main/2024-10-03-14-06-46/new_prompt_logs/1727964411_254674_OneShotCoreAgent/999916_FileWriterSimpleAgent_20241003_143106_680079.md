Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the scene loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: bee7a244-67da-45ce-a465-62cf7d2cfaa9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = "player"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Current Turn: {self.current_turn.capitalize()}

Available Skills:
{self._format_skills()}
"""

    def _format_skills(self):
        if self.current_turn == "player":
            creature = self.player_creature
        else:
            creature = self.opponent_creature
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.current_turn == "player":
                self._player_turn()
            else:
                self._opponent_turn()
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            
            self.current_turn = "opponent" if self.current_turn == "player" else "player"

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The `run` method now properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We've added a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. The scene loop continues until a transition occurs, ensuring that the scene doesn't terminate unexpectedly.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in MainGameScene continues until a transition or quit occurs.
3. We'll add a check for the battle end condition within the main game loop.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the current architecture.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now checks for battle end after each action, allowing for an immediate end to the battle if all creatures of one player are knocked out.

2. The `_check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean value, making it easier to use in control flow.

3. The `run` method now has a `while True` loop that continues until `_check_battle_end` returns True, ensuring that the battle continues until one player wins.

4. The `_end_battle` method now calls `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`, ensuring that the scene properly transitions back to the main menu when the battle ends.

These changes should resolve the issues raised in the test failures while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The scene will now properly exit by transitioning to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, addressing both the assertion error in the random run test and the FixableException in the full game flow test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

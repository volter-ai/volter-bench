## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing regarding the random turn order for creatures with the same speed, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. The current implementation doesn't account for randomizing the order when creatures have the same speed. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to introduce randomness when sorting actions for creatures with the same speed.

2. We'll use Python's `random.random()` function to add a small random factor to the sorting key, which will randomize the order of actions for creatures with the same speed.

Here's the rewritten `MainGameScene` class with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8737f2c6-df6e-4ea2-a661-3eb051005ea7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name}: HP {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {opponent_creature.hp}/{opponent_creature.max_hp}

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main change in this updated version is in the `_resolution_phase` method. The sorting key for the `turn_queue` now includes a `random.random()` factor:

# Excerpt ID: c6d60341-544e-4e08-948e-5ab1a8e187e0
```python
self.turn_queue.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] != "swap", -x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random()))
```

This change ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, their order will be randomized. The `random.random()` function returns a float between 0.0 and 1.0, which acts as a tie-breaker for creatures with the same speed.

This solution addresses the issue raised in the QA testing while maintaining the current architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

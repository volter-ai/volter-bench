## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state upon transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make a modification to the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the bot, resetting their HP to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and respects the architecture of the game. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 10ce42b4-e86c-4730-a497-fc31eb496e78
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._player_turn()
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._bot_turn()

        self._reset_creatures_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == use_skill_button:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self._use_skill(self.player_creature, self.bot_creature, skill_choice.thing)
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def _bot_turn(self):
        bot_skill = self.bot_creature.skills[0]  # Always use the first skill for simplicity
        self._use_skill(self.bot_creature, self.player_creature, bot_skill)

    def _use_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This solution adds the `_reset_creatures_state()` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. It's called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset for the next battle. The method also shows a text message to inform the player that all creatures have been restored to full health.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

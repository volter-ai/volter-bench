## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of skill execution order when creatures have the same speed, I will modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models. It only affects the game logic in the `MainGameScene`.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed fix:

# Excerpt ID: d590d24c-7c1c-4171-957c-eac8f8bf2b7d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        effectiveness = {

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. This aligns with the described architecture and should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

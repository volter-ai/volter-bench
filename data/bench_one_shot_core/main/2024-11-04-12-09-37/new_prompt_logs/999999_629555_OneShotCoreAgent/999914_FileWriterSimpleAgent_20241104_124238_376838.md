## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The test for the full game flow is failing because the MainGameScene is not properly ending the game or transitioning to another scene.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game or transition to another scene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll do it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then either transition back to the main menu or quit the game.
3. We'll call this method when we detect that the battle has ended in the check_battle_end method.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {damage} damage.")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.end_battle(False)
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.end_battle(True)

        return False

    def end_battle(self, player_won):
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost the battle!")

        # Ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])

        if choice == play_again_button:
            # Reset creature HP and transition back to the main menu
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The MainGameScene now properly ends the battle and either transitions back to the main menu or quits the game, depending on the player's choice.
2. This should fix the test failures, as the scene now always exits either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the game.

The modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. We're using the provided methods like `_transition_to_scene` and `_quit_whole_game` to handle scene transitions and game termination.

This solution should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

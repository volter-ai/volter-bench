## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Modify the resolution phase to handle random order if speeds are equal.
2. Update the type relationships to explicitly handle the "Normal" type as neither effective nor ineffective.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll add a random factor to the sorting key when speeds are equal.
2. In the `_get_type_factor` method, I'll explicitly handle the "Normal" type and ensure it's neither effective nor ineffective against any other type.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: d3293eaf-bdf0-402f-bfba-3861fe1fd96d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The resolution phase now handles random order if speeds are equal by adding a random factor to the sorting key.
2. The type relationships now explicitly handle the "Normal" type as neither effective nor ineffective against any other type.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall structure and capabilities of the engine. The changes are confined to the `MainGameScene` class, which is responsible for the game logic, and do not affect the models or the architecture of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

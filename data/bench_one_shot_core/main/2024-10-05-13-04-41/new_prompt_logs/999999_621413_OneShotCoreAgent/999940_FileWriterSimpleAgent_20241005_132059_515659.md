Content: I understand the issue. The current implementation doesn't handle ties in speed randomly during the skill execution order in the resolution phase, which deviates from the specified architecture. Here's how I'll fix this issue:

1. In the `MainGameScene` class, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to handle speed ties randomly.
2. I'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly select which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
3. This change will not require any modifications to the models, as it's purely a logic change within the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6a0241d5-d446-41cd-b71b-99fee2254498
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})

        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense

            self.end_battle()
            return True

    def end_battle(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to handle speed ties randomly. When the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal, the code now uses `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first. This ensures that the execution order is determined randomly in case of a speed tie, adhering to the specified architecture.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

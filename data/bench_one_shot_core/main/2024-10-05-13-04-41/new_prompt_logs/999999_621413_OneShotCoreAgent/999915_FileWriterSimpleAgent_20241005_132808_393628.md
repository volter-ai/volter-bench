Content: To address the issue of speed ties not being handled randomly in the MainGameScene, we need to modify the resolution_phase method. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll use Python's random module to decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
2. We'll modify the resolution_phase method to implement this random decision.
3. We'll ensure that the rest of the battle logic remains unchanged.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models or the overall architecture.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 00180b61-785e-4121-b34d-5d30a6f77723
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.player_choice_phase() and self.foe_choice_phase():
                if not self.resolution_phase():
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    break
            else:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill = choice.thing
        return True

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        return True

    def resolution_phase(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = self.player, self.opponent
            first_skill, second_skill = self.player_skill, self.opponent_skill
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = self.opponent, self.player
            first_skill, second_skill = self.opponent_skill, self.player_skill
        else:
            # Speed tie, randomly decide who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = self.player, self.opponent

        if not self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):
            return False
        if not self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill):
            return False
        return True

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        attacker_creature = attacker.creatures[0]
        defender_creature = defender.creatures[0]

        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

        if defender_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} fainted!")
            if defender == self.player:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return False
        return True

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)
```

This modification addresses the issue by introducing a random decision when the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal. The rest of the battle logic remains unchanged, ensuring that the solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models or overall architecture.

Content: I understand the issue now. The error occurs because we're passing a Creature object instead of a Skill object to the _calculate_damage method. This is likely due to a mistake in how we're handling the player's and opponent's choices. Let's fix this issue by updating the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the _player_choice_phase and _foe_choice_phase methods, we'll return the actual Skill object instead of just the Button.
2. We'll update the _resolution_phase method to pass the correct Skill objects to _execute_skill.
3. We'll adjust the _execute_skill method to take the Skill object directly instead of getting it from the attacker.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError we were seeing. The main fixes are:

1. The _player_choice_phase and _foe_choice_phase methods now return Skill objects instead of Button objects.
2. The _resolution_phase method now passes the correct Skill objects to _execute_skill.
3. The _execute_skill method now takes the Skill object as a separate parameter, rather than trying to get it from the attacker's creatures.

These changes ensure that we're always working with Skill objects when we need to, which should resolve the 'Creature' object has no attribute 'is_physical' error.

Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the FixableException that occurs when attempting to use an AbstractThing (in this case, Player objects) as a hashable ID. The error suggests that we should use the `prototype_id` instead. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the MainGameScene to use the `prototype_id` of the players as dictionary keys instead of the player objects themselves.

2. We'll ensure that we're not using any AbstractThing objects as dictionary keys or in any other context where hashability is required.

3. We'll maintain the separation of concerns and adhere to the engine's capabilities by not modifying the models or adding methods to them.

Here's the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by:

1. Using `prototype_id` instead of Player objects as dictionary keys in the `resolution_phase` method.
2. Modifying the `determine_execution_order` method to return tuples with `prototype_id` instead of Player objects.
3. Adjusting the logic in the `resolution_phase` to work with the `prototype_id` instead of Player objects directly.

These changes ensure that we're not using AbstractThing objects (like Player) as hashable keys, which was causing the FixableException. The rest of the implementation remains unchanged, maintaining the separation of concerns and adhering to the engine's capabilities. The models are not modified, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

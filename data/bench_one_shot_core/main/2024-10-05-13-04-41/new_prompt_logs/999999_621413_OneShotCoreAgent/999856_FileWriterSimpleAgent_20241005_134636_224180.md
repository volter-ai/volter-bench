Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError where the 'Skill' object has no attribute 'speed'. This error occurs in the resolution_phase method of the MainGameScene class. The problem is that we're trying to sort actions based on the speed of the skill, but skills don't have a speed attribute. Instead, we should be using the speed of the creature using the skill.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class to use the active creature's speed instead of the skill's speed when sorting actions.

2. We'll also need to adjust the structure of the action tuple to include the creature performing the action, not just the skill.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```

These changes address the AttributeError by using the creature's speed instead of the skill's speed when sorting actions. We've also adjusted the structure of the action tuples to include the creature performing the action, which allows us to access the creature's speed when sorting.

The main changes are:

1. In the `choose_attack` method, we now return a tuple that includes the active creature: `("attack", current_player.active_creature, choice.thing)`

2. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now sort based on the creature's speed: `sorted(actions, key=lambda x: x[1].speed if x[0] == "attack" else 0, reverse=True)`

3. We've adjusted the `perform_attack` method to work with the new action structure.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the intended game logic and adhering to the engine's capabilities and the existing model structure.

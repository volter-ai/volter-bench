Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problems and propose a solution that adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the issues, we'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

a) Modify the resolution phase to ensure swaps are executed before skills:
   - We'll separate the actions into swaps and attacks.
   - Execute all swaps first, then execute all attacks.

b) Implement forced swaps when a creature is knocked out:
   - After each attack, check if the defending creature's HP is 0.
   - If so, call the force_swap method for the appropriate player.
   - If force_swap returns False (no available creatures), end the battle.

c) Update the force_swap method:
   - Return False if there are no available creatures.
   - Update the active_creature of the player.

These changes will ensure that the game follows the required architecture and handles creature knockouts correctly.

2. Rewritten file with the proposed solution:

```

This implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. Swaps are now executed before skills in the resolution phase.
2. The forced swap is called when a creature is knocked out.
3. The battle ends immediately if a player has no more creatures available after a knockout.

The changes maintain the structure of the existing code while ensuring that the game follows the required architecture and handles creature knockouts correctly. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Content: I understand the issue now. The main problem is that the MainGameScene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. To fix this, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game when a battle is concluded. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to call this new method after the battle loop ends.
3. We'll ensure that the `_check_battle_end` method returns True when the battle is over.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues in the following ways:

1. We've added a `battle_ended` flag to the MainGameScene class to properly control the battle loop.
2. The `run` method now continues the battle loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. After the battle ends, we call `_reset_creatures` and then `_return_to_main_menu`.
4. The new `_return_to_main_menu` method shows a message to the player and then transitions back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene`, which should resolve the FixableException we were seeing. The scene will no longer terminate without calling either `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

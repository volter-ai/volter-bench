Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. We'll update the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `run` method of MainGameScene, we'll add a call to `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the battle ends.
2. We'll move the `_reset_creatures` call inside the battle loop, right after we check if the battle has ended.
3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and if so, which player won.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e26cecc1-78c0-488f-8e82-f47801cc7a1f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            battle_end, winner = self._check_battle_end()
            if battle_end:
                self._reset_creatures()
                if winner == self.player:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
                break

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            return True, self.opponent
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            return True, self.player
        return False, None

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, instead of terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. The scene will now exit correctly, and the tests should pass.

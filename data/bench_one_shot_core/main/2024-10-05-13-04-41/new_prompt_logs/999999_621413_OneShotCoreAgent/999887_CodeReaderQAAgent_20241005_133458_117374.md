# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### Main Menu Scene
1. **Welcome Message**: The player is shown a welcome message at the start of the Main Menu Scene.
   - **Code Check**: The `__str__` method in `MainMenuScene` includes a welcome message. **(Correct)**

2. **Play or Quit Options**: The player is prompted to either play the game or quit.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` provides options to play or quit. **(Correct)**

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**: Choosing to play takes the player to the MainGameScene.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` transitions to `MainGameScene` when "Play" is chosen. **(Correct)**

4. **Quit Game**: Choosing to quit exits the game entirely.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainMenuScene` calls `_quit_whole_game` when "Quit" is chosen. **(Correct)**

### Main Game Scene
5. **Player vs Bot Battle**: The MainGameScene allows a human player to battle against a bot player.
   - **Code Check**: `MainGameScene` initializes with a player and an opponent bot. **(Correct)**

6. **Turn Phases**: The game consists of repeating turns with Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
   - **Code Check**: The `run` method in `MainGameScene` implements these phases. **(Correct)**

7. **Player Choice Phase**: The player is shown their creature's list of available skills and can choose one to queue for resolution.
   - **Code Check**: The `_player_choice_phase` method shows skills and allows the player to choose. **(Correct)**

8. **Foe Choice Phase**: The bot chooses a skill from its creature's list to queue for resolution.
   - **Code Check**: The `_foe_choice_phase` method randomly selects a skill for the bot. **(Correct)**

9. **Resolution Phase**: Queued skills are resolved based on the speed of the creatures.
   - **Code Check**: The `_resolution_phase` method resolves skills based on speed. **(Correct)**

10. **Skill Execution Order**: Skills are executed based on the speed stat; if speeds are equal, the order is random.
    - **Code Check**: The `_determine_order` method implements this logic. **(Correct)**

11. **Physical Skill Damage Calculation**: Raw damage for physical skills is calculated as attacker's attack plus skill base damage minus defender's defense.
    - **Code Check**: The `_calculate_damage` method implements this formula. **(Correct)**

12. **Special Skill Damage Calculation**: Raw damage for special skills is calculated as the ratio of attacker's sp. attack to defender's sp. defense multiplied by skill base damage.
    - **Code Check**: The `_calculate_damage` method implements this formula. **(Correct)**

13. **Weakness-Resistance Factor**: Final damage is raw damage multiplied by a weakness-resistance factor based on skill type vs. creature type.
    - **Code Check**: The `_calculate_damage` method uses `_get_type_factor` to apply this factor. **(Correct)**

14. **Damage Calculation with Floats**: All damage calculations are performed with floats and converted to an integer for final damage.
    - **Code Check**: The `_calculate_damage` method uses floats and converts to int. **(Correct)**

15. **Battle End Condition**: The battle ends when a creature's hp reaches zero, with a message indicating win or loss.
    - **Code Check**: The `_check_battle_end` method checks hp and shows messages. **(Correct)**

16. **Reset Player's Creatures**: When transitioning out of the MainGameScene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
    - **Code Check**: The `_reset_creatures` method resets hp to max_hp. **(Correct)**

### Type Relationships
17. **Type Effectiveness**: Implement type effectiveness where "Fire" is effective against "Leaf" and ineffective against "Water", "Water" is effective against "Fire" and ineffective against "Leaf", and "Leaf" is effective against "Water" and ineffective against "Fire". "Normal" has no effectiveness or ineffectiveness.
    - **Code Check**: The `_get_type_factor` method implements these relationships. **(Correct)**

### Player Prototypes
18. **Default Player**: Has creatures ["bubwool"].
    - **Code Check**: The `default_player` in `player.json` has "bubwool". **(Correct)**

19. **Basic Opponent**: Has creatures ["scizard"].
    - **Code Check**: The `basic_opponent` in `player.json` has "scizard". **(Correct)**

### Creature Prototypes
20. **Bubwool**: "water" type, 32 hp, 11 attack, 10 defense, 12 sp. attack, 12 sp. defense, 13 speed, Skills: ["Tackle", "Lick"].
    - **Code Check**: The `bubwool` in `creature.json` matches these attributes. **(Correct)**

21. **Scizard**: "fire" type, 40 hp, 11 attack, 13 defense, 11 sp. attack, 13 sp. defense, 11 speed, Skills: ["Tackle", "Fireball"].
    - **Code Check**: The `scizard` in `creature.json` matches these attributes. **(Correct)**

### Skill Prototypes
22. **Tackle**: "normal" type, physical, 7 damage.
    - **Code Check**: The `tackle` in `skill.json` matches these attributes. **(Correct)**

23. **Fireball**: "fire" type, special, 5 damage.
    - **Code Check**: The `fireball` in `skill.json` matches these attributes. **(Correct)**

24. **Lick**: "water" type, physical, 5 damage.
    - **Code Check**: The `lick` in `skill.json` matches these attributes. **(Correct)**

### Summary
The code in the `main_game` folder correctly implements the described architecture and logic of the game as per the provided documentation. There are no discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

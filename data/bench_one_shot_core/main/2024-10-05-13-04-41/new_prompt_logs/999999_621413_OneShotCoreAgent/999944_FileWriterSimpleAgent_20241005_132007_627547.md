Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly between scenes.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the MainGameScene's run method continues to loop until the battle ends and a transition occurs.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 95c42f5f-1840-45aa-ad49-e01343ec5c5f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        choices = [Button("Return to Main Menu"), Button("Quit Game")]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Modifying the `check_battle_end` method to return `True` when the battle ends, which will break the main game loop.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that presents the player with choices to return to the main menu or quit the game after the battle ends.
3. Ensuring that the scene always exits properly by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These changes should resolve both the issue in the MainGameScene test and the whole game flow test. The scene will now properly exit after the battle ends, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game entirely.

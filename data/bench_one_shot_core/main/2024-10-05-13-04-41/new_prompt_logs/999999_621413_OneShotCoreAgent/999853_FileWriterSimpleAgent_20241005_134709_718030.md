Content: I understand the issue now. The error occurs because we're trying to access the 'defense' attribute of a Player object instead of a Creature object. This is happening in the `calculate_damage` method of the `MainGameScene` class. To fix this, we need to ensure that we're always passing Creature objects to this method, not Player objects.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. In the `perform_attack` method, we need to pass the active creatures of the players instead of the players themselves.

2. We'll adjust the logic in the `resolution_phase` method to ensure we're always working with Creature objects for attacks.

3. We'll update the `perform_swap` method to work with Player objects directly.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now use `action[1].active_creature.speed` for sorting, ensuring we're always using a Creature's speed.

2. In the same method, we've updated the attack handling to explicitly use the active creatures of the players:
# Excerpt ID: 9f1dc0b7-2f92-4e20-9602-e43c8e4f31c2
   ```python
   attacker = action[1].active_creature
   defender = self.bot.active_creature if action[1] == self.player else self.player.active_creature
   self.perform_attack(attacker, defender, action[2])
   ```

3. The `perform_attack` method now takes Creature objects directly for attacker and defender, instead of Player objects.

These changes ensure that we're always working with Creature objects when calculating damage and performing attacks, which should resolve the AttributeError we were seeing. The rest of the game logic remains intact, and we're still adhering to the engine's capabilities and the existing model structure.

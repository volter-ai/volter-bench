Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The scene is not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of its execution, which is causing the FixableException.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a new method called `end_battle` that will be called when the battle is over.
2. In the `end_battle` method, we'll show the result message and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll call the `end_battle` method from the `check_battle_end` method when a creature's HP reaches zero.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

    def end_battle(self, message: str):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses both issues:

1. The `check_battle_end` method now calls `end_battle` when a creature's HP reaches zero, which shows the result message and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
2. By transitioning to the MainMenuScene at the end of the battle, we ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game (which can be done from the MainMenuScene).

These changes should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the MainGameScene always exits in an expected manner. The random test runs should now complete successfully without raising exceptions related to improper scene termination.

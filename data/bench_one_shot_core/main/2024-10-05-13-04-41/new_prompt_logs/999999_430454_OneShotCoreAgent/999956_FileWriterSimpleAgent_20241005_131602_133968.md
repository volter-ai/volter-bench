Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is causing the FixableException to be raised.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when `_check_battle_end` returns True), we'll add logic to transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll also add a "Return to Main Menu" option after displaying the battle result.

This approach will ensure that the scene always ends with a proper transition, adhering to the engine's requirements.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d8555a5c-087a-4f77-8714-26cc6a650769
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self):
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        if choice == return_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution adds an `_end_battle` method that is called when the battle ends. It presents the player with a "Return to Main Menu" button and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the button is pressed. This ensures that the scene always ends with a proper transition, resolving the FixableException issue.

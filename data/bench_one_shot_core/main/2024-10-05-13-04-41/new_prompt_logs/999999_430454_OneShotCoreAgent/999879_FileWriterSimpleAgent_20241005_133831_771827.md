Content: To address the issue of not handling the case where creatures have the same speed, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. Add a method to determine the order of skill execution when speeds are equal.
2. Modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use this new method for determining execution order.
3. Implement a random decision when speeds are equal, as specified in the architecture documentation.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a new `_determine_execution_order` method that handles the case where creatures have the same speed.
2. Using `random.choice` to randomly decide which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
3. Modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to use the new `_determine_execution_order` method for determining the order of skill execution.

These changes ensure that the game now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed, as required by the architecture documentation. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Content: I understand the issue. The current implementation doesn't handle the case where creatures have the same speed by randomizing the order of skill execution, as specified in the architecture. To fix this, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills in the determined order.

This solution adheres to the architecture description and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as we're only modifying the game logic within the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 446b2246-595c-4f53-9a26-dd6015e118cd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase

        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_defender, first_skill = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill
            second_attacker, second_defender, second_skill = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill

                second_attacker, second_defender, second_skill = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill
            else:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")

    def _end_battle(self):
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        if choice == return_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution modifies the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice([True, False])` to randomly decide which creature goes first. This ensures that the order of skill execution is randomized when speeds are equal, adhering to the architecture description.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing functionality while addressing the specific issue raised in the QA pass.

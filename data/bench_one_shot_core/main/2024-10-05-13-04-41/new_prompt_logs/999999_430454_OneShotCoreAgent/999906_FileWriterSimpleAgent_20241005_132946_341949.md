Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The test for the full game flow is failing because the MainGameScene is not properly ending the game or transitioning to another scene.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game or transition to another scene when the battle is over. Here's how we'll do it:

1. We'll add a new method called `_end_battle` in the MainGameScene.
2. This method will be called when a creature's HP reaches zero.
3. The `_end_battle` method will show the result message and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b5153143-a0a6-47c9-809f-18f02ed69f10
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = 0

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            self.current_turn += 1
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        attacker_name = self.player.display_name if attacker == self.player_creature else self.opponent.display_name
        defender_name = self.opponent.display_name if attacker == self.player_creature else self.player.display_name

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_name}'s {defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle(f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self, message):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses both issues:

1. The MainGameScene now properly ends the battle by calling `_end_battle` when a creature's HP reaches zero.
2. The `_end_battle` method shows the result message and then transitions back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the scene doesn't terminate without calling `transition_to_scene` or `quit_whole_game`.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene will now properly exit when the battle ends, and the full game flow test should pass as the MainGameScene correctly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle.

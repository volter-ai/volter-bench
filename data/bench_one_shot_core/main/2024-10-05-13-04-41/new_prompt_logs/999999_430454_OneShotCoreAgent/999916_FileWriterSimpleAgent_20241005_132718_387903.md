Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError where the code is trying to access the 'defense' attribute on a Player object instead of a Creature object. The problem is in the `_execute_skill` method of the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `_execute_skill` method to use the correct objects for attack and defense calculations.
2. We'll ensure that we're passing the correct Creature objects to this method, not the Player objects.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 95366a7f-1d6c-4c39-a806-14aeeac315c6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_phase = "player_choice"

        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            if self.current_phase == "player_choice":
                self._player_choice_phase()
            elif self.current_phase == "foe_choice":
                self._foe_choice_phase()
            elif self.current_phase == "resolution":
                self._resolution_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        self.opponent_skill = choice.thing
        self.current_phase = "resolution"

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self._determine_order()
        self._execute_skill(first[1], first[2], second[2])
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(second[1], second[2], first[2])
        self.current_phase = "player_choice"

                return (self.player, self.player_skill, self.player_creature), (self.opponent, self.opponent_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, self.opponent_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.player, self.player_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, skill: Skill, attacker_creature: Creature, defender_creature: Creature):

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The main changes are in the `_resolution_phase` and `_execute_skill` methods:

1. In `_resolution_phase`, we now pass the Creature objects instead of the Player objects to `_execute_skill`.
2. In `_execute_skill`, we've changed the parameter types to explicitly use Skill and Creature objects, ensuring we're working with the correct attributes.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the battle mechanics to function correctly. The rest of the file remains largely the same, maintaining the overall structure and logic of the MainGameScene.

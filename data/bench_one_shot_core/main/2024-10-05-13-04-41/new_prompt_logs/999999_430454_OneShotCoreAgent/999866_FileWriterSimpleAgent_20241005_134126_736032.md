Content: To fix the issue, we need to import the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes in the main.py file. The error occurs because these scene classes are not imported, causing a NameError when trying to register them.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add the necessary import statements at the beginning of the main.py file to import both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.
2. We'll keep the rest of the App class implementation the same, as the issue is solely related to missing imports.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 89bb4e8f-b0ea-4eed-ab81-e3f1f06bf9b3
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution adds the necessary imports for MainMenuScene and MainGameScene at the beginning of the file. The rest of the App class implementation remains the same. This change should resolve the NameError and allow the scenes to be properly registered and used within the application.

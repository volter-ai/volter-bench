Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not handling speed ties randomly in the resolution phase.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for speed ties and use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly determine which creature goes first in case of a tie. This approach aligns with the specified architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 80300990-a14a-4350-bb7e-390332b5743b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.reset_battle()

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.game_loop()
            if self.battle_ended:
                self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def game_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            self.check_battle_end()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Speed tie, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True

    def _quit_whole_game(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Thanks for playing!")
        super()._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to handle speed ties randomly. When the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal, the code now uses `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature attacks first. This ensures that speed ties are resolved fairly and in accordance with the specified architecture.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class while fixing the specific issue raised during QA/testing.

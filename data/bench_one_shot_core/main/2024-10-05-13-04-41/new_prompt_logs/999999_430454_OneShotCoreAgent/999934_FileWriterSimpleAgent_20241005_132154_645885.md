Content: To address the issue of not handling equal speed creatures by randomizing the order of skill execution in the Resolution Phase, I'll modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how I plan to fix this issue:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this randomized order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture. It only affects the battle logic within the MainGameScene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case of equal speed creatures. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice([True, False])` to randomly determine which creature goes first. The `_execute_skills_in_order` method is introduced to simplify the skill execution logic.

These changes ensure that when creatures have equal speed, the order of skill execution is randomized in the Resolution Phase, as required by the QA feedback.

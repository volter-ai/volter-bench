Content: To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. The reset should occur before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value.
2. We'll call this method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene in the check_battle_end method.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: de2240ad-9593-4e32-b76a-ff08367760ed
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self.bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn! Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def bot_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot's turn! Choosing a skill...")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Player's skill resolution
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}! It dealt {player_skill.damage} damage.")
        
        # Bot's skill resolution
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Bot used {bot_skill.display_name}! It dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage.")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This implementation adds the `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot. The method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `check_battle_end` method. This ensures that the creatures' HP is reset to their maximum value before starting a new battle, addressing the issue raised in the QA pass.

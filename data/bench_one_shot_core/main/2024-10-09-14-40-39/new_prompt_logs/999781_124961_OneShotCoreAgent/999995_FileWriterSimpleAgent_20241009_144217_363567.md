## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The game loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly, causing the scene to terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. Modify the game loop to continue until the battle ends.
3. Implement proper scene transitions or game termination after the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1d5bf794-0ada-4b21-a412-bc92e518c2b0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild foe appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.handle_battle_end()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.foe_creature.hp <= 0

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        self.battle_ended = True
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")
        
        self.reset_creatures()
        
        # Ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the game loop.
2. Implementing a `handle_battle_end` method to properly conclude the battle and offer the player choices to play again or quit.
3. Ensuring that the scene always transitions to another scene or returns to the main menu after the battle ends.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, either by transitioning to a new game or returning to the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

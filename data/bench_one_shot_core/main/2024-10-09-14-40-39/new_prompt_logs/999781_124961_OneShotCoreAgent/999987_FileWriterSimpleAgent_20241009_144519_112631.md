## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when speeds are equal.
2. Use floats for damage calculations and convert to integers only for the final damage value.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. In the `resolve_turn` method, I'll add a check for equal speeds and use `random.choice` to determine the order of skill execution.
2. In the `execute_skill` method, I'll use floats for all calculations and only convert to an integer at the final step.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. Random decision-making for skill execution order when speeds are equal is now implemented in the `resolve_turn` method.
2. Damage calculations now use floats, and the final damage is converted to an integer only at the last step in the `execute_skill` method.

The rest of the implementation remains the same, adhering to the guidelines and architecture of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

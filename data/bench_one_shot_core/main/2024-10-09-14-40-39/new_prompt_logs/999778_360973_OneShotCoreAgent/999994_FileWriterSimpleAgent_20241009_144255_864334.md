## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I will make the following changes:

1. Implement random determination of execution order when creatures have equal speed in the `MainGameScene`.
2. Remove the enforced minimum damage of 1, allowing the damage calculation to result in 0 or negative values as per the architecture.

These changes will be made in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll implement these fixes:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, I'll add a check for equal speed and use `random.choice` to determine the order of execution.
2. In the `execute_skill` method, I'll remove the `max(1, damage)` call and allow the damage calculation to be potentially 0 or negative.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 8cba5160-e634-4dee-8e1a-c2b4b45efef2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn:
{self.get_skill_choices()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly determine order
            first, second = random.choice([(self.player, self.opponent), (self.opponent, self.player)])
            first_creature = first.creatures[0]
            second_creature = second.creatures[0]
            first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player else foe_skill
            second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player else player_skill

            self.execute_skill(first, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(second, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now includes a case for equal speed, where the order of execution is randomly determined using `random.choice`.
2. The `execute_skill` method no longer enforces a minimum damage of 1. The damage calculation can now result in 0 or negative values, as per the architecture.

These modifications ensure that the implementation adheres more closely to the specified architecture while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

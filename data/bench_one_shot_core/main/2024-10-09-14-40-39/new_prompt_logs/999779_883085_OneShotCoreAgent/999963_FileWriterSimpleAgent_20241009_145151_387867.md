## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Explicitly check for battle end conditions after each action, not just at the end of a turn.
2. Reset creature states when leaving the MainGameScene, not just at the end of a battle.
3. Move the bot opponent creation to the `run` method, as it's not mentioned in the architecture to be done in the constructor.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's the plan to address each issue:

1. We'll add a `check_and_handle_battle_end` method that will be called after each action (attack or swap).
2. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method that will be called when leaving the scene.
3. We'll move the bot opponent creation to the beginning of the `run` method.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e55b51db-3dce-42be-b04f-0d91921482e3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `check_and_handle_battle_end` method is now called after each action in the `resolve_turn` method and after each player's turn in the `run` method.
2. The `reset_creatures` method is now called when leaving the scene, just before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.
3. The bot opponent creation has been moved to the beginning of the `run` method.

The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class. The implementation now more closely follows the described architecture while addressing the minor discrepancies noted in the QA feedback.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Welcome message: We'll add a clear welcome message at the beginning of the MainGameScene run method.
b) Display of player's skills: We'll modify the __str__ method of MainGameScene to show the player's available skills.
c) Random choice for equal speed: We'll explicitly handle this in the resolution phase.
d) Battle end condition: We'll change the HP check to use == 0 instead of <= 0.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene:

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 8334e802-c0f8-4686-8f1d-f164b461f0e6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        skills_str = "\n".join([f"  > {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{skills_str}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to the Creature Battle!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose a skill:")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Equal speed, random order
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
            else:
                first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        
        self._execute_skill(*first, second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(*second, first[1])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses all the issues raised in the QA/testing feedback while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture:

1. A clear welcome message is added at the beginning of the `run` method.
2. The player's skills are now explicitly shown in the `__str__` method.
3. The random choice for equal speed is clearly handled in the `_resolution_phase` method.
4. The battle end condition now checks for HP == 0 instead of HP <= 0.

Additionally, the scene now properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene exits in the expected manner.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Explicitly reset the player's creatures' states when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Clearly inform both players of their win or loss at the end of the battle.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll address each issue:

1. We'll modify the `reset_creatures` method to reset not only the HP but also the active creature for both players.
2. We'll update the `end_battle` method to show the battle result to both players.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `reset_creatures` method now resets not only the HP of all creatures but also sets the active creature back to the first creature in each player's list.
2. The `end_battle` method now clearly informs both players of their win or loss.

These modifications ensure that the player's creatures' states are explicitly reset when leaving the MainGameScene, and both players are clearly informed of the battle outcome. The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Random decision-making for equal speed in battles:
   We'll add a random decision when creatures have equal speed in the resolution phase.

b) Explicit welcome message in MainMenuScene:
   We'll add a welcome message at the beginning of the MainMenuScene run method.

c) Display of available skills before player choice:
   We'll modify the __str__ method of MainGameScene to not show skills, and instead show them only during the choice phase.

d) Remove minimum damage of 1:
   We'll remove the minimum damage calculation and allow for 0 or negative damage.

e) Remove return to MainMenuScene after battle end:
   We'll end the scene without transitioning back to MainMenuScene, as per the architecture.

2. Rewriting the files:

We need to modify both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. Here are the proposed solutions:

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing feedback while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture. The MainMenuScene now explicitly shows a welcome message, and the MainGameScene implements random decision-making for equal speed, removes the minimum damage of 1, and ends the scene without transitioning back to MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

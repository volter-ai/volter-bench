## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Implement speed-based order for skill execution.
3. Handle random resolution for equal speed.
4. Ensure float calculations are used throughout the damage calculation process before converting to integer.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's the plan to address each issue:

1. We'll add a 'Back' button in the attack and swap choice methods.
2. We'll modify the `resolve_turn` method to sort actions based on creature speed.
3. We'll use `random.shuffle` to randomize the order of actions with equal speed.
4. We'll update the `calculate_damage` method to use float calculations throughout.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choice methods.
2. The `resolve_turn` method now sorts actions based on creature speed.
3. Random resolution for equal speed is handled by shuffling actions with the same speed.
4. Float calculations are now used throughout the damage calculation process before converting to integer.

The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

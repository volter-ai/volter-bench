## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not properly exiting, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The random test runs are not completing as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a check in the `run` method to break the loop when the battle ends.
3. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a tuple indicating whether the battle has ended and who the winner is.

These changes will ensure that the scene properly exits and transitions back to the main menu, which should resolve both test failures.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1e8c7b81-666e-4222-81e7-ab4bb5b5ac1e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        # Reset creatures' HP for the next battle
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` properly exits and transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends. The `run` method now breaks the loop when the battle ends, and we've added an `end_battle` method to handle the end-of-battle logic and reset the creatures' HP for the next battle.

This solution adheres to the guidelines by keeping the models as pure data schemas and maintaining the overall architecture of the game while fixing the issues within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

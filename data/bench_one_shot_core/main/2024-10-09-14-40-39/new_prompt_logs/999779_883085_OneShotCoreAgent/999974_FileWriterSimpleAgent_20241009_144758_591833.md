## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `choose_swap` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering choices.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None instead of trying to offer choices.
3. We'll update the `player_turn` method to handle the case where `choose_swap` returns None.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by checking if there are available creatures to swap to before offering choices in the `choose_swap` method. If there are no available creatures, it returns None, and the `player_turn` method handles this by defaulting to an attack action. This should prevent the `_wait_for_choice` method from being called with an empty list of choices, resolving the AssertionError we were encountering.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

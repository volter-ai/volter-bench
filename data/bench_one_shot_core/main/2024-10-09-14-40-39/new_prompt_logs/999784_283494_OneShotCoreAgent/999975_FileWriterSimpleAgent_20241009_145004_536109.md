## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Add missing messages for battle outcomes.
2. Correct the damage calculation handling to align with the architecture.
3. Adjust type effectiveness scaling to match the specified relationships.
4. Ensure all calculations are done with floats and only converted to integers at the final step.

Here's how I'll implement these fixes while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture:

1. Add more detailed battle outcome messages using `_show_text`.
2. Reimplement the damage calculation formulas as specified in the architecture.
3. Update the type effectiveness relationships to match the architecture specifications.
4. Ensure all calculations use floats until the final damage is determined.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 18e1acbc-0b53-4ff4-b897-1ebaea9b6e20
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2

            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)

        else:
            raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense)) * float(skill.base_damage)

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"fire": 1.0, "water": 1.0, "leaf": 1.0},
            "fire": {"fire": 1.0, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2.0},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "water": 1.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"fire": 0.5, "water": 2.0, "leaf": 1.0}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. More detailed battle outcome messages have been added using `_show_text`.
2. The damage calculation formulas now align with the architecture specifications.
3. Type effectiveness relationships have been updated to match the architecture specifications.
4. All calculations use floats until the final damage is determined, which is then converted to an integer.

These modifications ensure that the implementation adheres more closely to the specified architecture while maintaining the core functionality of the battle system. The changes are confined to the MainGameScene, keeping the models as pure data schemas and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The game flow is not properly handling the end of the battle.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a check to see if the player wants to play again after each battle.
3. We'll ensure that the `_quit_whole_game` method is called when the player chooses to quit.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 886417c5-d156-4ea4-bf3b-927377ecd91a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = 0

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self.current_turn += 1

                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self.ask_play_again()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

            return True

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `ask_play_again` method that is called after the battle ends.
2. Providing options to play again or return to the main menu.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to properly exit the MainGameScene and move to either a new battle or the main menu.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The changes are focused on the scene logic, which is where game flow should be handled.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

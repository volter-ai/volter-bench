## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the damage calculation.
2. Ensure all damage formulas are performed with floats and then converted to an integer at the final step.
3. Modify the reset_creatures() method to only reset the player's creatures.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: f2eb7d0a-acb2-4f31-88e5-7f7b121fd9d4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}:
HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}:
HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):

        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense)) * float(skill.base_damage)

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"fire": 1.0, "water": 1.0, "leaf": 1.0},
            "fire": {"fire": 1.0, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2.0},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "water": 1.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"fire": 0.5, "water": 2.0, "leaf": 1.0}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The 'normal' type is now explicitly handled in the `get_type_factor` method, with effectiveness values defined for all creature types.
2. All damage calculations in the `calculate_damage` method now use floats explicitly, with the final conversion to an integer happening at the end of the calculation.
3. The `reset_creatures` method now only resets the player's creatures, not the opponent's.

These modifications ensure that the implementation adheres more closely to the specified architecture while maintaining the core functionality of the battle system. The changes are confined to the MainGameScene, keeping the models as pure data schemas and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Welcome message in MainMenuScene:
   I'll add a welcome message to the MainMenuScene's `__str__` method.

b) Rounding errors in damage calculations:
   I'll modify the damage calculation to use integer arithmetic throughout, avoiding floating-point operations.

c) Incorrect handling of minimum damage:
   I'll ensure that the minimum damage dealt is 1, as specified in the architecture.

d) Reset of creatures:
   Instead of resetting creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene, I'll move this logic to the MainMenuScene, resetting creatures when entering the scene.

2. Rewriting the necessary files:

I'll need to modify both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene to address these issues. Here are the updated implementations:

```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. A welcome message has been added to the MainMenuScene.
2. Damage calculations now use integer arithmetic to avoid rounding errors.
3. The minimum damage dealt is ensured to be 1.
4. Creature reset logic has been moved to the MainMenuScene, occurring when entering the scene rather than when exiting the MainGameScene.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain as pure data schemas, while all game logic is contained within the scene classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

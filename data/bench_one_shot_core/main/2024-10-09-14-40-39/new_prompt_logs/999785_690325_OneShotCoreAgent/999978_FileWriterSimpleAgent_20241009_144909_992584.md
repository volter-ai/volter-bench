## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issue:

   a) We'll modify the damage calculation in MainGameScene to use floats instead of integer division. This will ensure more precise damage calculations as specified in the architecture.
   
   b) We'll change the type effectiveness factors back to floats, which will better align with the intended gameplay mechanics.
   
   c) We'll use the `round()` function to convert the final damage to an integer, as required by the Creature model's hp attribute.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

```

This implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The damage calculation now uses floats instead of integer division, ensuring more precise calculations.
2. Type effectiveness factors are now implemented as floats, aligning with the intended gameplay mechanics.
3. The `round()` function is used to convert the final damage to an integer, as required by the Creature model's hp attribute.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain as pure data schemas, while all game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Reset bot's creatures: We'll modify the `_reset_creatures` method to reset both the player's and the bot's creatures when leaving the scene.

2. Simultaneous knockouts: We'll update the `_execute_skill` method to handle the case where both active creatures are knocked out simultaneously.

3. Normal type effectiveness: We'll explicitly address the 'normal' skill type in the `_get_type_factor` method.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The modifications adhere to the engine's architecture and maintain the purity of the models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The changes made to address the issues are:

1. In the `_reset_creatures` method, we now reset both the player's and the bot's creatures:
# Excerpt ID: 727db2c5-d493-472b-8ad7-4ed2c88fa63b
   ```python
   def _reset_creatures(self):
       for player in [self.player, self.bot]:
           for creature in player.creatures:
               creature.hp = creature.max_hp
   ```

2. In the `_execute_skill` method, we now check if the attacker's creature is also knocked out after executing a skill:
# Excerpt ID: cd6d6209-1ef6-41ef-a467-b680e8c6814c
   ```python
   if defender_creature.hp == 0:
       self._handle_knockout(defender)
   
   # Check if attacker's creature is also knocked out (e.g., from recoil damage)
   if attacker.active_creature.hp == 0:
       self._handle_knockout(attacker)
   ```

3. In the `_get_type_factor` method, we explicitly handle the 'normal' skill type:
# Excerpt ID: eae58543-d894-4cfd-b8d8-04a5b8e53db5
   ```python
   def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
       effectiveness = {
           ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
           ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
           ("water", "fire"): 2,
           ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
           ("leaf", "water"): 2,
           ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
       }
       if skill_type == "normal":
           return 1  # Normal type is neutral against all types
       return effectiveness.get((skill_type, creature_type), 1)
   ```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing while maintaining the game's logic and adhering to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

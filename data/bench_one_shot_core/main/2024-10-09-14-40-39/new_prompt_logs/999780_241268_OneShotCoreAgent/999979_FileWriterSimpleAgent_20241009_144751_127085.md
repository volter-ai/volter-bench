## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Ensure a minimum damage of 1 in the damage calculation.
2. Include the type effectiveness for 'Normal' type.
3. Explicitly state the final damage conversion to integer in the code.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_calculate_damage` method, we'll add a `max(1, final_damage)` to ensure a minimum damage of 1.
2. We'll update the `_get_type_factor` method to include 'Normal' type effectiveness.
3. We'll explicitly cast the final damage to an integer using `int()` in the `_calculate_damage` method.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `_calculate_damage` method now ensures a minimum damage of 1 using `max(1, final_damage)`.
2. The `_get_type_factor` method now includes the 'Normal' type effectiveness for all types.
3. The final damage conversion to integer is now explicitly stated in the `_calculate_damage` method using `int(raw_damage * type_factor)`.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

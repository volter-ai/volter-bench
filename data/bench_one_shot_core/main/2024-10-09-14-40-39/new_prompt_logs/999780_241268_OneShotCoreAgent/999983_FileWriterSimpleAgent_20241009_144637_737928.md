## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement a random decision for turn order when creatures have equal speed.
2. Remove the minimum damage of 1, as it's not specified in the architecture.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolve_turns` method, we'll add a check for equal speed and use `random.choice` to decide which creature goes first.
2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, we'll remove the `max(1, final_damage)` call and return the `final_damage` directly.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 8b565bb5-61a7-4fc1-99aa-9cfb46cbeda2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

            ])

                (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
                if first_attacker == self.player_creature
                else (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        return final_damage  # Removed the max(1, final_damage) to allow for 0 damage

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

        return False

    def _reset_creatures_hp(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `_resolve_turns` method now handles the case where both creatures have equal speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first.
2. The `_calculate_damage` method no longer enforces a minimum damage of 1, allowing for the possibility of 0 damage as per the architecture specifications.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

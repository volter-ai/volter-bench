## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue and will address it by implementing the Leaf type in the type relationships and ensuring that intermediate damage calculations are performed using floats. Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. Update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include the Leaf type.
2. Modify the damage calculation in the `execute_skill` method to use floats for intermediate calculations.

These changes will be made in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the updated file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 513ba718-a24f-46f3-92f8-869c634bf48b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if use_skill_button == choice:
                self.battle_turn()
            elif quit_button == choice:

    def choose_skill(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]

        if skill_type == defender_type:

             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

The changes made to address the issues are:

1. In the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, I've added the Leaf type to the type relationships. Now it correctly handles all the relationships between Fire, Water, and Leaf types as specified in the architecture.

2. In the `execute_skill` method, I've modified the damage calculation to use floats for intermediate calculations. The `raw_damage` is now calculated as a float, and the final damage is converted to an integer only at the end of the calculation.

These changes ensure that the implementation adheres to the architecture specifications and correctly handles all the type relationships, including the Leaf type.

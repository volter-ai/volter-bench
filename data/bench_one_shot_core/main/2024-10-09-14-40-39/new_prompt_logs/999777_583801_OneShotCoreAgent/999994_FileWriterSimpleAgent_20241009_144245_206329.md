## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random order selection for creatures with equal speed:
   - In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll add a check for equal speed and use `random.choice` to determine the order when speeds are equal.

2. Remove the minimum damage calculation:
   - In the `execute_skill` method, we'll remove the line that ensures at least 1 damage is dealt, as this was not specified in the architecture.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b0d8a4c6-b172-43d3-aa0e-f2fc0b63b3b9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now handles the case where creatures have equal speed by randomly selecting which creature goes first.
2. The `execute_skill` method no longer enforces a minimum damage of 1, allowing the damage calculation to potentially result in zero or negative damage as per the original architecture specification.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining compliance with the engine capabilities and the overall architecture of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the two main discrepancies:

a) Random resolution for creatures with equal speed:
We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random factor when sorting the turn queue. For creatures with equal speed, we'll use a random number to determine their order.

b) Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
We'll add a new method `_force_swap` that will be called after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`. This method will check if the active creature's HP is zero and force a swap if necessary. If no swap is possible, it will end the battle.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class, keeping the models as pure data schemas and staying within the engine's capabilities.

2. Rewritten file with the proposed solution:

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. Random resolution for creatures with equal speed: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've added a random factor to the sorting key. This ensures that when creatures have equal speed, their order will be randomized.

2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero: We've added a new `_force_swap` method that checks if a creature's HP is zero and forces a swap if possible. This method is called after each action in the `_resolution_phase`. If a forced swap is not possible (i.e., no more creatures with HP > 0), the battle ends.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

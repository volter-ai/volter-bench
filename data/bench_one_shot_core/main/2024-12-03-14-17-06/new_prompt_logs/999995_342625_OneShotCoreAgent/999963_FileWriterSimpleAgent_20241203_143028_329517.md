Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is a NameError because 'uuid' is not defined in main.py. This is a simple import issue - we need to import the uuid module at the top of main.py. Looking at the original code, we already import uuid in lib.py but we need to import it explicitly in main.py since we're using it directly there.

The fix is straightforward - just add the uuid import to main.py. This doesn't affect any architectural concerns since it's just adding a missing import. It doesn't change any models or scene logic.

2. Here's the fixed main.py:

# Excerpt ID: 9fd60f1b-369e-4615-af5b-7b87442e249f
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

The only change is adding `import uuid` at the top of the file. This should resolve the NameError while maintaining all architectural requirements and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

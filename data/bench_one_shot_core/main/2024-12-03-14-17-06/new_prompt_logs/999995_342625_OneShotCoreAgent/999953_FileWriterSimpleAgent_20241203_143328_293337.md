Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture docs. According to the docs, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should have the option to go back to the previous menu.

The fix will:
- Add a "Back" button to both the skills selection and creature swap menus
- Handle the back button by recursively calling get_player_action
- Stay within engine capabilities by using Button and _wait_for_choice
- Not modify any models since they should remain pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill selection and creature swap menus
2. Modified get_player_action to handle the Back button by recursively showing the main menu
3. Used Button for Back option to distinguish it from SelectThing choices
4. No changes to models or engine interaction patterns

This implements the "Back" functionality as specified in the architecture docs while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference `player_action` which is not in scope. The issue is that we're trying to determine if the current action belongs to the player or bot by comparing it to a variable that doesn't exist.

The fix is to modify the execute_action method to take an additional parameter indicating which player the action belongs to, rather than trying to compare the action itself. This stays within the engine's capabilities and doesn't require any model changes.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Modified get_action_order to return tuples of (action, player) instead of just actions
2. Modified resolve_turn to unpack these tuples and pass both action and player to execute_action
3. Modified execute_action to take an acting_player parameter and use it to determine attacker/defender

This fixes the NameError while maintaining the engine's architecture and not requiring any model changes. The scene still handles all game logic and uses the engine's methods properly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not catching the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine's design, when `_quit_whole_game()` is called, it raises a `_QuitWholeGame` exception that should be caught and handled gracefully.

Looking at the test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly handles scene transitions and quits by patching them. We should follow the same pattern in test_main_game_scene.py by patching `_quit_whole_game` to prevent the exception from propagating.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: beb9edb7-5837-4ee6-a1c7-74ea6a7b7ae1
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class QuitGame(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_game(*args, **kwargs):
                raise QuitGame()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game', side_effect=exit_game) as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except QuitGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game did not end properly"
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper patching of `_quit_whole_game` similar to how test_main_menu_scene.py handles transitions
2. Created a custom `QuitGame` exception to catch when the game quits
3. Added proper exception handling for both the quit case and random mode case
4. Added assertion to ensure the game ended properly
5. Added cleanup in finally block

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the game flow, including graceful termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to get a bot's action in MainGameScene when there are no available creatures to swap to. This happens because we're trying to show swap choices even when there are no valid creatures to swap to.

The fix should:
- Check if there are any available creatures before offering the swap option
- Only show the swap button if there are valid creatures to swap to
- Stay within engine capabilities by using _wait_for_choice properly
- Not modify any models since they should remain pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added get_available_creatures helper method to centralize the logic for finding valid swap targets
2. Modified get_player_action to only show the Swap option if there are available creatures
3. Updated handle_knockout to use the new get_available_creatures method
4. No changes to models or engine interaction patterns

This fixes the AssertionError by ensuring we never call _wait_for_choice with an empty list of choices, while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

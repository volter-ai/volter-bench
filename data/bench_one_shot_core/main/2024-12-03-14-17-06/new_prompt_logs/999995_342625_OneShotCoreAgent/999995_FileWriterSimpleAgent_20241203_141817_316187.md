Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 36bf3904-36bb-466f-88c8-2ed339e05eda
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    damage: int
    category: str = "Skill"

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]
    category: str = "Creature"

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    category: str = "Player"
```

# Excerpt ID: 1b3687be-dff8-48ac-830b-a9ecff037675
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} (DMG: {skill.damage})" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._handle_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self._handle_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
                
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _handle_turn(self, current_player, creature):
        choices = []
        for skill in creature.skills:
            choice = DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name)
            choice.value = {"skill": skill}
            choices.append(choice)
            
        result = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return result.value["skill"]
```

The key change is removing the `reset()` method from the Creature model and directly setting hp = max_hp in the MainGameScene. This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes).

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

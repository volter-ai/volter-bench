Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When running in random mode, we need to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit AND _QuitWholeGame exceptions. This is because both are valid ways for the scene to end during random testing.

The fix is to update the test file to properly catch both exceptions. We don't need to change any game logic since the _QuitWholeGame exception is actually expected behavior - it's just that our test wasn't handling it properly.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 90a89949-2c0f-45d2-a956-36e1f2131155
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during random run: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added a catch-all handler that fails the test for any unexpected exceptions
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains all the architectural requirements while properly handling both expected ways the scene can end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

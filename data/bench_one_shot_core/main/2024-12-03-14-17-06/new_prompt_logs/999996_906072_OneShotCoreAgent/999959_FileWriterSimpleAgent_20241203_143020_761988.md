Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature choices for swapping but not checking if there are any valid creatures to swap to. This can happen when all other creatures are knocked out. We need to handle this case by not allowing the "Swap" option if there are no valid creatures to swap to.

I'll fix the MainGameScene by:
1. Only showing the "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Adding proper handling for when all creatures are knocked out

Here's the complete fixed file:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_creatures` helper method to centralize creature availability logic
2. Added `handle_forced_swap` method to handle knocked out creatures
3. Modified `get_player_action` to only show "Swap" when there are available creatures
4. Added proper handling of knocked out creatures in the main run loop
5. Improved the battle flow to properly end when all creatures are knocked out

These changes ensure we never try to show an empty list of choices while maintaining all the game mechanics and following the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where we're getting an empty choices list when trying to swap creatures. This happens because we're not checking if there are any valid creatures to swap to before presenting the swap option.

The fix should:
1. Only show the "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Handle the case where a creature is knocked out but there are no valid creatures to swap to

Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: f1120b9a-b8ae-4142-87cb-94bff0a5c200
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Initialize creatures
        for p in [self.player, self.bot]:
            p.active_creature = p.creatures[0]
            for c in p.creatures:
                c.hp = c.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        p_creature = self.player.active_creature
        b_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {p_creature.display_name}: {p_creature.hp}/{p_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe's {b_creature.display_name}: {b_creature.hp}/{b_creature.max_hp} HP

Your other creatures: {[c.display_name for c in self.player.creatures if c != p_creature and c.hp > 0]}

                    return True
        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_creatures` helper method to centralize the logic for finding valid swap targets
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show the Swap button if there are creatures available to swap to
3. Updated `check_battle_end` to handle the case where a creature is knocked out but there are no valid swap targets
4. Used the helper method consistently throughout the code

This should fix the empty choices list error while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

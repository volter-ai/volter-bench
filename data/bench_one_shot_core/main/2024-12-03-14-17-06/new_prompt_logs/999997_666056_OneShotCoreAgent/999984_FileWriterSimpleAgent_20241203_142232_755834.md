Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's _resolve_turn method when calling _execute_skill. The error shows we're passing 6 arguments when the method expects 5.

Looking at the code:
# Excerpt ID: 635ac727-6639-410e-913f-17955d96ff40
```python
first = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_chosen_skill)
second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_chosen_skill)
self._execute_skill(*first, *second[1:])
```

The issue is that we're unpacking both tuples incorrectly. When we do `*first, *second[1:]`, we're passing:
- self.player (from first)
- self.player_creature (from first) 
- self.player_chosen_skill (from first)
- self.opponent_creature (from second[1:])
- self.opponent_chosen_skill (from second[1:])

But looking at _execute_skill's signature:
# Excerpt ID: 7717858e-ed98-4ee0-9414-7861fb3716c2
```python
def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
```

We don't need to pass the attacker Player object at all - it's only used for showing text. We should modify the tuples to only contain the relevant battle information.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: aa3cfd64-a0ba-42c5-9e94-9525b78e9d90
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        # Determine order based on speed
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:

        # Execute moves in order
        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], first[2], second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:  # Only execute second move if target still alive
            self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], second[2], first[1])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        
        # Calculate final damage
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        # Show result
        effectiveness = "It's super effective!" if multiplier > 1 else "It's not very effective..." if multiplier < 1 else ""
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes:
1. Restructured how we package battle information in _resolve_turn
2. Changed how we pass arguments to _execute_skill to match its signature
3. Kept the player object separate since it's only needed for showing text
4. Maintained all the same functionality while fixing the argument passing issue

This should resolve the test failures while maintaining the architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

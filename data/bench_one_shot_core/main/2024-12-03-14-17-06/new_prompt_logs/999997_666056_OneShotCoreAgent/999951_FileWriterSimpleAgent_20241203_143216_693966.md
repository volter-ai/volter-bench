Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is being called during the random test run. Looking at the output, we can see that creatures are being knocked out but the game isn't properly transitioning back to the main menu when all creatures are defeated.

The issue is in MainGameScene where:
- We're showing "No other creatures available!" messages but not properly ending the game
- The check_battle_end() logic isn't being called in the right places
- We need to ensure game-ending conditions are checked after every knockout

Fix approach:
- Move battle end check into handle_knockout
- Ensure handle_knockout is called whenever a creature reaches 0 HP
- Return early from resolve_turn if the battle ends
- Keep all changes within scene logic, no model changes needed

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added return values to resolve_turn and execute_action to track battle end state
2. Modified handle_knockout to return True when battle ends
3. Ensured _transition_to_scene is called when all creatures are knocked out
4. Added proper return handling throughout the call chain
5. No changes to models or engine interaction required

This should fix the test failure by ensuring the scene properly transitions when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp back to max_hp directly in the scene

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: 503843b4-eca7-4c22-b6b9-4d0ddc302812
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

And the corresponding scene change (only showing the modified method):

# Excerpt ID: 06bf3788-7a2b-4cb2-bee3-ad0e7ed9e784
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle Start! {self.player_creature.display_name} vs {self.opponent_creature.display_name}")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )
            
            # Execute skills
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
                
            self._execute_skill(*second)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is removing the `reset()` method from the Creature model and directly setting hp = max_hp in the scene instead. This maintains the separation between data models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

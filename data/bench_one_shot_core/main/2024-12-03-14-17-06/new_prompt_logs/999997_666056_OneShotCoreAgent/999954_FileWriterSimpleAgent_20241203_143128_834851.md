Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method because action[2] is missing. This is happening because we're not properly tracking which player (human or bot) is performing the action. The error propagates from get_action_order where we create tuples with only two elements (action type and thing) but try to access a third element for the player identifier.

The fix needs to:
- Ensure actions consistently include player identification
- Maintain proper action structure throughout the battle flow
- Stay within engine capabilities using only provided methods
- Not modify the models since they must remain pure data schemas

2. Solution:
I'll rewrite main_game_scene.py to fix the action tuple structure and ensure player identification is maintained throughout. The key changes are:
- Make action tuples consistently have 3 elements: (action_type, thing, player_id)
- Update get_player_action to include player identification
- Adjust resolve_turn and execute_action accordingly

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added player_id parameter to get_player_action
2. Modified action tuples to consistently include player identification
3. Updated get_action_order to preserve the full action tuple structure
4. No changes to models or engine interaction

This should resolve the IndexError while maintaining the game's architecture and functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill - Has type, damage, physical/special flag
- Creature - Has stats, type, skills collection
- Player - Has creatures collection and active creature

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json - Contains skill prototypes like Tackle, Fireball, etc.
- creature.json - Contains creature prototypes like Bubwool, Scizard, etc. 
- player.json - Contains player prototypes with their creature lists

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene - Simple menu with Play/Quit options
- MainGameScene - Complex battle scene with phases for player/bot choices and damage resolution

4. Create tests that run random choices through each scene

Here's the implementation:

This implementation follows all the guidelines:
1. Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
2. JSON files contain all prototype data
3. Scenes handle all game logic
4. Tests use random mode to verify scene functionality
5. Scene __str__ methods show all relevant info
6. Models reference other models directly
7. All entity creation uses from_prototype_id
8. Bots are created using create_bot and treated identically to players
9. The implementation follows the game design document closely:
   - MainMenuScene provides Play/Quit options
   - MainGameScene implements the full battle system with:
     - Turn phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
     - Damage calculation considering physical/special attacks
     - Type effectiveness system
     - Creature swapping mechanics
     - Battle end conditions

The code is organized to be maintainable and extensible:
- Models are cleanly separated from game logic
- Scene logic is compartmentalized into clear phases
- JSON files make it easy to add new creatures, skills, and players
- The battle system is implemented to handle both human and bot players uniformly

The test suite ensures the game runs properly by:
- Testing both scenes with random inputs
- Using longer random sequences for the more complex MainGameScene
- Verifying proper scene transitions and game exits

This implementation provides a complete creature battler game that follows all the engine guidelines while implementing the full feature set described in the documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

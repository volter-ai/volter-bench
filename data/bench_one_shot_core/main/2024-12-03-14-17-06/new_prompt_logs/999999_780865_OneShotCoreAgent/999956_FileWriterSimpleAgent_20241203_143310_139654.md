Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
- The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the player choice phase
- According to docs, when choosing "Attack" or "Swap", players should be able to go back to the main choice
- We'll modify get_player_action() to:
  - Add a "Back" button to skill and creature selection choices
  - Handle recursive choice selection to allow returning to main choices
  - Keep models pure by handling all logic in scene
  - Use existing Button/SelectThing choices from engine

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Modified get_player_action() to use a while loop for choice selection
2. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection choices
3. Used continue to return to main choices when "Back" is selected
4. Kept models pure by handling all logic in scene
5. Used existing Button/SelectThing choices from engine

The solution:
- Implements the required "Back" functionality
- Maintains pure data models
- Uses engine capabilities correctly
- Follows the game design document
- Preserves all existing battle mechanics

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

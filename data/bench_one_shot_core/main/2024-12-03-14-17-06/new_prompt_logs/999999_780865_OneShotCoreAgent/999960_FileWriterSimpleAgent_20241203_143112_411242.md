Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows two related problems:
- The MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting
- The tests are failing because neither transition nor quit is being called

The issue is in the MainGameScene's check_battle_end() method. When a battle ends, we're just showing text and returning True, but according to the engine we must either:
- Transition to another scene (like back to main menu)
- Or quit the whole game

Following the game design, when a battle ends we should return to the main menu. This maintains the game flow and follows the engine's requirements.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

Key changes:
1. Modified run() to properly transition to MainMenuScene when battle ends
2. Added creature HP reset before transitioning (as specified in docs)
3. Kept all models as pure data schemas
4. Maintained the engine's scene transition requirements
5. Fixed the test failures by ensuring proper scene exit

The solution:
- Follows the engine architecture by using proper scene transitions
- Maintains pure data models
- Implements the game design requirement to reset creatures after battle
- Fixes the test failures by properly ending scenes
- Creates a complete game loop (menu -> battle -> menu)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

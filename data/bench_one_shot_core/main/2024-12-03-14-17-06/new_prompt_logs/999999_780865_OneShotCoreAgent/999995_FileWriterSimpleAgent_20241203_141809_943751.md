Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead, I should:
- Remove the reset() method from Creature model
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- In MainGameScene, simply set hp = max_hp directly when initializing creatures

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: e48f8fb3-db76-4031-a201-8ef6ed8b6a37
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"

    description: str = ""

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player: Player, creature: Creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!\n"
            f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model to keep it as a pure data schema
2. Moved the reset logic directly into MainGameScene's __init__ method
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly when needed instead of calling a method

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

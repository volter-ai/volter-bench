Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine architecture, when a scene calls `_quit_whole_game()`, it raises a `_QuitWholeGame` exception that needs to be caught and handled.

Looking at the test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly handles both transition and quit scenarios. We should update test_main_game_scene.py to follow the same pattern:
- Mock the `_quit_whole_game` method
- Catch the appropriate exceptions
- Verify the mock was called

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: b62f0729-e1ad-4121-be02-25eae3891319
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game should end with _quit_whole_game being called"
                    print(f"battle completed naturally in run {i}")
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
- Added proper mocking of `_quit_whole_game`
- Added proper exception handling
- Added assertion to verify the game ends correctly
- Added cleanup in finally block

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the battle scene's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

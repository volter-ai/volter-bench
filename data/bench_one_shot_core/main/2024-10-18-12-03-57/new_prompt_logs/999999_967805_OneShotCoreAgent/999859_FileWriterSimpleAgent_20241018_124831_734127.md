## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. We should modify this method to check if there are any available creatures before offering the swap option.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `player_choice_phase` method, we'll first check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the "Swap" option.
2. We'll modify the `choose_swap` method to return `None` if there are no available creatures, instead of calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list.
3. In the `run` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None`, treating it as if no action was taken.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that the "Swap" option is only offered when there are available creatures to swap to, and handling the case where no swap is possible. This should prevent the `_wait_for_choice` method from being called with an empty list of choices.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

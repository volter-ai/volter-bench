## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not continuing after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop to continue running until a transition or quit is called.
3. We'll add a method to reset the battle state, allowing for multiple battles in a single game session.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 23b1c483-f283-41be-9ff8-b4f5915a0a1e

            self.battle_ended = False
        elif choice == main_menu_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_battle` method to initialize or reset the battle state.
2. Introducing a `battle_ended` flag to control the game loop.
3. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method to display the result and offer choices to play again or return to the main menu.
4. Modifying the game loop to continue running until a transition or quit is called.
5. Ensuring that the scene always exits by transitioning to another scene (MainMenuScene) or implicitly continuing the battle loop.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene behaves as expected within the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

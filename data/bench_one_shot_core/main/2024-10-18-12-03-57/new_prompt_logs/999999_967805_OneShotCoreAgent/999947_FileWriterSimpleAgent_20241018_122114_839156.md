## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the logic for handling the case where both creatures have the same speed and randomly deciding which creature goes first in the resolution phase. This functionality should be implemented in the MainGameScene, as it's part of the battle logic.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `run` method in the MainGameScene to determine the order of actions based on the creatures' speed.
2. We'll create a new method called `_determine_turn_order` that compares the speeds of the player's and opponent's creatures and returns a list of creatures in the order they should act.
3. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly decide which creature goes first.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: bdc24a27-1a15-48f0-ac13-f39aa354eda0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")

            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

            turn_order = self._determine_turn_order()
            for creature in turn_order:
                if creature == self.player_creature:
                    self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

    def _determine_turn_order(self):

            return [self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature]
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense

            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2.0

        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")

    def _return_to_main_menu(self):
        return_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [return_button])
        if choice == return_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Introducing a new `_determine_turn_order` method that compares the speeds of the creatures and randomly decides the order if they're equal.
2. Modifying the `run` method to use this new turn order determination.
3. Separating the skill selection from the skill execution, allowing us to determine the order after both players have chosen their skills.

These changes ensure that the battle logic now correctly handles cases where creatures have the same speed, randomly deciding which creature goes first in the resolution phase. This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

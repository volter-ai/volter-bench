## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem by implementing the missing logic for executing skills based on the creatures' speed and randomly deciding the order when speeds are equal. Here's how I plan to fix the issue:

1. Add a method to determine the order of skill execution based on creature speeds.
2. Modify the battle loop to execute skills in the correct order.
3. Implement a tie-breaker using random selection when speeds are equal.

These changes will be made in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's the updated implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 3166fde1-ffcf-4c19-a64e-547e2e54fc8d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `_battle_turn` method now handles the logic for a complete turn, including skill selection for both the player and the opponent.
2. The `_determine_turn_order` method compares the speeds of the creatures and randomly shuffles the order if they are equal.
3. The `_execute_skill` method has been modified to work with the new turn order system.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture, taking into account the speed of the creatures and randomly deciding the order when speeds are equal. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene as required.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

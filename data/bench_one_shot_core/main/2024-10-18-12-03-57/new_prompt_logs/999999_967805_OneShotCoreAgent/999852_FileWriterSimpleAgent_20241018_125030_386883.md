## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:
   - Add a 'Back' button to the attack and swap choices.
   - Implement logic to return to the main choice when 'Back' is selected.

2. Add logic for handling equal speed randomly in the Resolution Phase:
   - Modify the sorting of actions to use a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods. If the player selects 'Back', the method returns `None`, which causes the `player_choice_phase` to loop back to the main choice.

2. The logic for handling equal speed randomly is now implemented in the `resolution_phase` method. The `sort` function now uses a tuple key that includes both the creature's speed and a random number. This ensures that creatures with equal speed will be ordered randomly.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as all the game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

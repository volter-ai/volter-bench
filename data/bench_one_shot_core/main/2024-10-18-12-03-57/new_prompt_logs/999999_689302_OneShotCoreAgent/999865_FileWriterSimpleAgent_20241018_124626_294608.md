## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AssertionError that occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with no choices. This error is happening in the `_choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem is likely occurring because all creatures have been knocked out, leaving no available creatures to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_choose_swap` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to before calling `_wait_for_choice`.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
3. We'll update the `_player_choice_phase` method to handle the case where `_choose_swap` returns None.
4. We'll also add a check in the `run` method to end the battle if a player has no available creatures.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes should resolve the AssertionError by ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. The battle will end properly when a player runs out of available creatures, and the game will transition back to the main menu.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the architecture of the game. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max HP in the MainGameScene.
2. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and respects the architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1a871489-afe1-4256-836d-1fcaef2fcbc0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures' state before transitioning
        self.reset_creatures()
        
        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding a `reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum values. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

This solution adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities, and doesn't require any changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

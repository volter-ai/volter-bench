## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the explicit skill queue management in the MainGameScene as described in the architecture. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a skill queue to the MainGameScene class.
2. During the Player Choice and Foe Choice phases, we'll queue the chosen skills instead of applying them immediately.
3. In the Resolution Phase, we'll dequeue and apply the skills one by one.

This approach aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: df50289d-912c-4da3-848b-7efd63739aa7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}

Skill Queue: {', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.skill_queue)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            self.skill_queue.append((self.player, player_skill))

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, foe_skill))

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._show_battle_result()
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            if attacker == self.player:
                target = self.opponent_creature
            else:
                target = self.player_creature
            self._apply_damage(target, skill)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} dealt {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, skill: Skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

This implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `skill_queue` (using `collections.deque`) to the `MainGameScene` class.
2. In the Player Choice and Foe Choice phases, queueing the chosen skills along with the player who chose them, instead of applying them immediately.
3. Implementing a new `_resolution_phase` method that dequeues and applies the skills one by one, showing the results of each skill application.
4. Updating the `__str__` method to display the current state of the skill queue.

These changes ensure that the skill queue management is explicitly implemented as described in the architecture, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

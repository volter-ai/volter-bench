## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not properly exiting when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle concludes.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method in `MainGameScene` to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. We'll update the `run` method to break out of the main loop when the battle ends.
3. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` or quit the game, depending on the battle outcome.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 42adfd60-0676-4798-8ece-d022960fed52
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name}:
HP: {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp}

        self._perform_swap(player, new_creature)
        return True
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `run` method to use a `battle_ended` flag to control the main loop.
2. Using the return value of `_check_battle_end` to determine when the battle has ended.
3. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the scene properly exits when the battle concludes and transitions to another scene, adhering to the engine's requirements. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

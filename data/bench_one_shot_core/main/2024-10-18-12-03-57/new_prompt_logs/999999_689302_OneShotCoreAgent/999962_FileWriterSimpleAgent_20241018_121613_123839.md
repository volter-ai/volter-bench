## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we're trying to access `self.player_skill` and `self.opponent_skill` in the `determine_order` method, but these attributes don't exist. We need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to properly handle the skills chosen by the player and opponent. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `game_loop` method to store the chosen skills as instance variables.
2. We'll update the `resolution_phase` method to use these stored skills.
3. We'll adjust the `determine_order` method to work with the creature and skill pairs.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c8130581-301c-41a7-be0a-629c60b86b0f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.opponent_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self):
        player_pair = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_skill)
        opponent_pair = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
        
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return player_pair, opponent_pair
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            return opponent_pair, player_pair
        else:
            return random.choice([(player_pair, opponent_pair), (opponent_pair, player_pair)])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding `self.player_skill` and `self.opponent_skill` as instance variables in the `__init__` method.
2. Updating the `game_loop` method to store the chosen skills in these instance variables.
3. Modifying the `resolution_phase` method to call `determine_order` without arguments.
4. Changing the `determine_order` method to work with the stored creature and skill pairs.
5. Adjusting the `execute_skill` method to take the correct parameters.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the game to run properly. The solution maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

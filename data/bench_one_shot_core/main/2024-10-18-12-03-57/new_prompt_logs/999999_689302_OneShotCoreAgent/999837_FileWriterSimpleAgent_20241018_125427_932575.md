## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue raised during QA/testing. To fix this problem, we need to modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to implement random ordering when creatures have the same speed. Here's how we'll address this:

1. We'll modify the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
2. We'll use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random value between 0 and 1 for each action.
3. The sorting key will now be a tuple of (is_swap, -speed, random_value), ensuring that swaps still go first, higher speeds go next, and equal speeds are randomly ordered.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This solution addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random factor when sorting actions. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified as all the logic is contained within the scene, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

The key change is in the `_resolution_phase` method, where the sorting key now includes `random.random()` as the third element of the tuple. This ensures that when creatures have the same speed, their actions will be ordered randomly, as specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

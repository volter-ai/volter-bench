## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when a player wins or loses.

2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends (either win or lose).
2. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to return True when the battle ends and handle the transition in the run method.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 2ec24995-9ca3-4366-b51e-5e1e3b278ed6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self._execute_skill(*first)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(*second)

    def _determine_order(self, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if player_creature.speed > opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, opponent_creature, player_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif player_creature.speed < opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_creature, player_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, opponent_creature, player_creature, opponent_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_creature, player_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, player_creature, opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        factor = self._get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. We've modified the `run` method to break the loop and transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. The `_check_battle_end` method now returns True when the battle ends, which is used in the `run` method to trigger the scene transition.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly when the battle ends, either by winning or losing. The transition back to the MainMenuScene allows the player to start a new game or quit, maintaining the game flow.

The test for MainGameScene should now pass because the scene will exit as expected, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

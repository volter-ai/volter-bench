## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then provide the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions.

1. How to fix the issues:

a) Missing 'Back' option in the player choice phase:
   We'll add a 'Back' option when choosing skills or creatures to swap, allowing players to return to the main action selection.

b) Incorrect action execution order in the resolution phase:
   We'll modify the turn structure to collect actions from both players first, then execute them in the correct order based on speed and action type.

c) Lack of random turn order for creatures with the same speed:
   We'll implement a random tie-breaker when creatures have the same speed.

d) No reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the scene:
   We'll add a method to reset creatures' state when the battle ends and the scene transitions.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing model structure.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This rewritten `main_game_scene.py` addresses all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. Added 'Back' option in the player choice phase for both attack and swap actions.
2. Implemented correct action execution order in the resolution phase, considering swaps first and then using speed (with random tiebreaker) to determine the order.
3. Added random turn order for creatures with the same speed using the `random.random()` function as a tiebreaker.
4. Implemented `reset_creatures_state` method to reset the HP of all creatures when leaving the scene.

These changes maintain the existing model structure and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file remains unchanged, preserving the pure data schema nature of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

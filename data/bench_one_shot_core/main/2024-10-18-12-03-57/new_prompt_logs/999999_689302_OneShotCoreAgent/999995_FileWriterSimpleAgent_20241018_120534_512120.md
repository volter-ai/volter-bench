## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended and handle the transition accordingly.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit action is triggered.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: b4e99c1b-87e6-4284-b537-433f561951ac
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"A wild {self.player_creature.display_name} appears!")

        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            opponent_skill = self._player_turn(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._resolve_turn(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"Your {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"The opponent's {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the main game loop to continue until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating `_check_battle_end()` to set `battle_ended` to True when the battle is over.
4. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends and creatures are reset.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, addressing both the issue of the scene not exiting and the game loop not handling the end of the battle correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' states after a battle ends, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this functionality within the scene itself. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to the `MainGameScene` class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP.
3. We'll call this method at the end of the battle, just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

Here's the updated `MainGameScene` class with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: dde0bb4d-5ba1-4652-a615-8abef1700528
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds the `reset_creatures` method to the `MainGameScene` class. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. The method is called just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` in the `check_battle_end` method.

This solution adheres to the guidelines by keeping the models as pure data schemas and implementing the game logic within the scene. It also fulfills the requirement of resetting the player's creatures' states after a battle ends, as specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

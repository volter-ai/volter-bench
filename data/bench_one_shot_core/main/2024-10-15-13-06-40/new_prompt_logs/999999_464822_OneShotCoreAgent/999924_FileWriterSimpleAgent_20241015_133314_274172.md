## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to explicitly implement the random decision for creatures with the same speed. This change will align the implementation with the described architecture without altering the existing models or exceeding the engine's capabilities.

Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll add a condition to check if the speeds of both creatures are equal.
2. If the speeds are equal, I'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. I'll then use this decision to determine the order of skill execution.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f3925396-73f3-4e10-88cf-e535c71a47b1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():

            # Random decision when speeds are equal
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skills(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation of the `MainGameScene` class now includes the random decision for creatures with the same speed in the `_resolution_phase` method. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice([True, False])` to randomly decide which creature goes first. This change aligns the implementation with the described architecture while maintaining the existing model structure and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

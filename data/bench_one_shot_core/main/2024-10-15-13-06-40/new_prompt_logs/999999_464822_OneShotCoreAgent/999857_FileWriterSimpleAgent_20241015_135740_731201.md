## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement random tie-breaking for skill execution order when creatures have the same speed.
2. Add forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolve_turn` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are tied.
2. We'll add a new method `_check_and_force_swap` that will be called after each attack to check if a creature has been knocked out and force a swap if necessary.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, which should remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `_resolve_turn` method now includes a random factor in the sorting key, ensuring that creatures with the same speed will be ordered randomly.
2. A new `_check_and_force_swap` method has been added and is called after each attack. This method checks if the active creature has been knocked out and forces a swap if necessary.

These modifications maintain the required architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

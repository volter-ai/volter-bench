## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends. We'll update the `run` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle concludes, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, instead of just returning True when the battle ends, we'll transition to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll remove the `while True` loop from the `run` method and instead use a single-pass approach, as the battle will now end properly with a scene transition.
3. We'll add appropriate messages to inform the player of the battle outcome before transitioning.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 5e02cfc6-d6d8-4487-a838-36a1c02b78c6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.check_battle_end():
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):

        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, either due to the player winning or losing. The `run` method now uses a `while` loop that continues until `check_battle_end` returns `True`, which happens when either creature's HP reaches 0.

The `check_battle_end` method now handles the scene transition, showing appropriate messages to the player before transitioning back to the main menu. This approach ensures that the scene always exits properly, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected, transitioning between scenes correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

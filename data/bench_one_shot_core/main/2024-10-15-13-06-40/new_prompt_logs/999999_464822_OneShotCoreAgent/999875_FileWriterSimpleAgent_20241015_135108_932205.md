## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes in the `MainGameScene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, or quit the game if the player chooses to do so.
2. We'll remove the `turn_queue` attribute from the `MainGameScene` and instead use a local variable within the `resolution_phase` method.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already correct.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that gives the player the option to play again or quit the game. This ensures that the scene always exits properly by either transitioning to the `MainMenuScene` or quitting the game.

2. Removing the `turn_queue` attribute and instead using it as a local variable within the `resolution_phase` method. This eliminates the unserializable attribute warning.

3. Modifying the `run` method to call `end_battle` after the battle concludes, ensuring that the scene always transitions or quits.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they were already correct and followed the guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

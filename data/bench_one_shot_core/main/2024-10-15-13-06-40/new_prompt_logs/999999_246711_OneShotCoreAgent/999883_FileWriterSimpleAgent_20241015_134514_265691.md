## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is an antipattern in the engine's architecture.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until a winner is determined.
2. After determining the winner, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` instead of just ending the scene.
3. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.turn_queue = []

```

These changes address the issue by ensuring that the scene properly transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, instead of just terminating. The `reset_creatures` method is added to restore all creatures' HP to their maximum values before transitioning back to the main menu.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between the data models and the game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged as a pure data schema, while the game logic is handled in the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the run method, we'll add logic to transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a new method called _end_battle to handle the transition or quitting based on the battle result.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 581ff83b-c9d2-484e-8229-9b63fd1583bd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})

        while True:

            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended, player_won = self._check_battle_end()
            if battle_ended:
                self._end_battle(player_won)

                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True, False
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

        return False, False

    def _end_battle(self, player_won):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Congratulations on your victory!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Better luck next time!")

        # Reset creature HP for the next battle
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly ending the battle and transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over. The _check_battle_end method now returns a tuple indicating whether the battle has ended and whether the player won. The run method uses this information to call _end_battle when appropriate, which handles displaying the final messages and transitioning back to the main menu.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

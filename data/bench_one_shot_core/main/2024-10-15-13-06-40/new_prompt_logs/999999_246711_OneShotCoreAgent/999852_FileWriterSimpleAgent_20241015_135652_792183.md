## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You're absolutely right, and I'll address this issue while adhering to the guidelines and architecture of the engine. Here's how we'll fix the problem:

1. We'll remove the class method `from_prototype_id` from the Player class in `models.py`. This method violates the rule that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties.

2. Instead of adding logic to the Player model, we'll move the initialization of the active_creature to the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in the `main.py` file.

3. We'll ensure that the Player model remains a pure data schema, inheriting from AbstractPlayer without any additional methods or properties.

Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 72fdbcca-8d8a-4710-b05b-054806b0fd7b
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature = None
```

Now, to complete the fix, we need to update the `main.py` file to handle the initialization of the active_creature. Here's the updated `main.py`:

# Excerpt ID: 1e0bc1e9-aaca-4cd5-afef-23eb0aa0d7e7
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
import uuid

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_from_game_database("default_player", Player)
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_from_game_database(prototype_id, Player)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Removing the `from_prototype_id` method from the Player class in `models.py`, ensuring it remains a pure data schema.
2. Using `create_from_game_database` in `main.py` to create Player instances, which is the correct way to instantiate models in this engine.
3. Initializing the `active_creature` in the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods of the App class, keeping the logic out of the model.

This solution maintains the separation of concerns, keeps the models as pure data schemas, and utilizes the engine's capabilities correctly. The `MainGameScene` should now work correctly with these changes, as the `active_creature` will be properly initialized for both the player and the bot.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

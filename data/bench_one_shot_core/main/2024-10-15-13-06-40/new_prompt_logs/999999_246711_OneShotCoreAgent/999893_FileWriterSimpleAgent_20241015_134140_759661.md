## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this requirement in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue by following these steps:

1. To fix the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state after a battle ends, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' state and call it when transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

2. We'll modify the `main_game_scene.py` file to include this new functionality.

Here's how we'll implement the fix:

1. Add a new method called `reset_creatures_state` to the `MainGameScene` class.
2. This method will reset the HP of both the player's and opponent's creatures to their maximum HP.
3. Call this method in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning to the `MainMenuScene`.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 60b26dbf-e304-4db4-b29d-da3ddbdc6225
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.check_battle_end()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.battle_ended:
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.creatures[0].attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.creatures[0].sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            self.reset_creatures_state()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")

```

This solution addresses the issue by adding a `reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum HP. This method is called in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset after each battle.

This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The `Creature` model in `models.py` remains a pure data schema, while the game logic for resetting the creatures' state is handled in the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not handling the random order on speed tie in the resolution phase as described in the architecture documentation.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the solution:

   - If the speed of both creatures is equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly decide which creature goes first.
   - We'll create a list of tuples containing the attacker, defender, and skill for each creature.
   - We'll then shuffle this list if there's a speed tie, or order it based on speed if there isn't.
   - Finally, we'll execute the skills in the determined order.

This approach aligns with the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as it only affects the game logic within the scene.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f478df68-5ed9-4dfd-ab9b-2d9fb760c32d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        player_action = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        foe_action = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose the order
            actions = random.sample([player_action, foe_action], 2)
        elif self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            actions = [player_action, foe_action]
        else:
            actions = [foe_action, player_action]

        for action in actions:
            attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature = action
            self.execute_skill(attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                break  # Stop if the defender is defeated

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now correctly handles the random order on speed tie in the resolution phase, as described in the architecture documentation. The `resolution_phase` method has been updated to randomly determine the order of actions when the creatures have equal speed, while maintaining the specified order when speeds differ. This change aligns the implementation with the architecture requirements and should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

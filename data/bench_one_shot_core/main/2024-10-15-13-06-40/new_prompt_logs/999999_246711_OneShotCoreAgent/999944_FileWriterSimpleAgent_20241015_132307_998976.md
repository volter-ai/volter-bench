## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the resolution phase in the MainGameScene where the random order for skill execution when creatures have the same speed is not implemented.

1. To fix this issue, I will modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class. We'll implement a check to see if the creatures have the same speed, and if so, we'll use random.choice to determine which creature goes first. This aligns with the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 5961839b-56d2-4225-a0c4-2d77e9cebded
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_choice = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            if isinstance(player_choice, Button) and player_choice.display_name == "Quit":
                self._quit_whole_game()
                return

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_choice.thing, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        quit_choice = Button("Quit")
        choices = skill_choices + [quit_choice]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
        elif self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
            second_attacker = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            first_attacker = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            second_attacker = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)

        # Execute skills in the determined order
        self.execute_skill(*first_attacker[:3], first_attacker[4])
        if first_attacker[4].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(*second_attacker[:3], second_attacker[4])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `resolution_phase` method to implement the random order for skill execution when creatures have the same speed. The changes include:

1. Checking if the speeds of both creatures are equal.
2. If speeds are equal, using `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first.
3. Executing the skills in the randomly determined order when speeds are equal.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns with the architecture documentation and properly handles the case where creatures have the same speed. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing functionality while addressing the specific issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The 'Field' object has no attribute 'display_name' in the MainGameScene.
2. The `_wait_for_choice` method is being called with no choices in the MainGameScene.

These issues suggest that there's a problem with how we're initializing and accessing the active_creature for both the player and the opponent. We need to ensure that the active_creature is properly set and accessed.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `models.py` file, we'll update the Player class to initialize the active_creature properly.
2. In the `main_game_scene.py` file, we'll modify the __init__ method to ensure the active_creature is set for both the player and the opponent.
3. We'll also update the choose_swap method to handle the case when there are no available creatures to swap to.

Let's rewrite the necessary files with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. We've updated the Player model to properly initialize the active_creature.
2. In the MainGameScene, we now ensure that both the player and opponent have an active_creature set at the beginning of the battle.
3. We've added checks to handle cases where a player might not have an active creature or when there are no creatures available to swap.
4. The __str__ method now handles cases where active_creature might be None.
5. The choose_swap method now returns None if there are no available creatures to swap to, preventing the _wait_for_choice method from being called with an empty list of choices.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and AssertionError issues while maintaining the overall structure and capabilities of the game engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner in the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of just breaking the loop.
2. We'll add a "Return to Main Menu" option after the battle ends, allowing the player to choose whether to play again or quit the game.

Here's how we'll implement these changes in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 758eb781-6246-46dc-a9b9-1a61d995add8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        if self.battle_ended:
            return """===Battle Ended===

2. Quit Game

        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):

        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):

    def get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":

        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def post_battle_options(self):
        return_to_menu = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choices = [return_to_menu, quit_game]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == return_to_menu:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_game:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game. This should resolve both issues mentioned in the test failures:

1. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.
2. The random run test should now pass because the scene will exit in an expected manner.

The modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. We've only added logic to the scene itself, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being initialized properly. Looking at the error and architecture:

1. The problem is that `active_creature` needs to be Optional since it starts as None and gets set later during gameplay
2. We need to modify the Player model in models.py to make `active_creature` optional using Optional from typing
3. This matches the architecture since:
   - Models remain pure data schemas
   - We're still inheriting from AbstractPlayer
   - We're using proper typing
   - The game logic for setting active_creature remains in the scenes

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 8c0184b0-1eb3-4074-8246-730e9d463440
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The key change is making `active_creature` optional with a None default value. This allows the Player to be created without an active_creature, which gets set later in the MainGameScene when combat begins.

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while fixing the validation error. The scenes can still manage when the active_creature gets set, but now the Player model properly represents that this field can be None initially.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that MainGameScene's run() method is breaking from its loop without properly ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()` or transitioning to another scene. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must explicitly end via one of these methods.

The fix is to:
1. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends (when check_battle_end() returns True)
2. Keep all models as pure data schemas
3. Stay within engine capabilities
4. Maintain the battle logic integrity

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the run() method where we now properly end the game by calling `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. This ensures we follow the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly end via transition or quit.

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged since it was working correctly. This fix maintains:
1. Pure data models
2. Proper scene flow
3. Battle mechanics
4. Engine compatibility

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that in MainGameScene, we're using Button choices but trying to access skill properties directly from the Button. Instead, we need to:

1. Store the actual Skill objects when getting choices from players
2. Use SelectThing choices instead of Button choices since we're selecting Skill objects
3. Access the skill properties through the selected thing

This aligns with the engine's design where SelectThing is used to choose game entities (AbstractThing objects).

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 08f6a0a4-dcfa-4e2d-ac30-6d29e4fc31c3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_chosen_skill = None
        self.opponent_chosen_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle begins between {self.player.display_name} and {self.opponent.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )
            self.player_chosen_skill = player_choice.thing

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            )
            self.opponent_chosen_skill = opponent_choice.thing

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self.determine_order()
            self.execute_turn(first)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_turn(second)
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            else:
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, self.opponent)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.player)
        else:
            return random.choice([(self.player, self.opponent), (self.opponent, self.player)])

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def execute_turn(self, player):
        attacker = self.player_creature if player == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        defender = self.opponent_creature if player == self.player else self.player_creature
        skill = self.player_chosen_skill if player == self.player else self.opponent_chosen_skill

        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} has been defeated!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name} has been defeated!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed Button to SelectThing for skill choices
2. Store the actual skill object using choice.thing instead of the Button directly
3. Now we can properly access skill properties in calculate_damage()

This maintains the proper architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- We use SelectThing for choosing game entities
- We properly handle both human and bot players
- The scene logic remains clean and organized

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

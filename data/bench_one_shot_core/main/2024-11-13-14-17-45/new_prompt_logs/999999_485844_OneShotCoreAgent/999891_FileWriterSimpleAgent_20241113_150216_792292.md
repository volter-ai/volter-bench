Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because `_quit_whole_game()` raises an exception that needs to be caught. In the test, we need to handle both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions.

The test should:
1. Catch both types of expected exceptions
2. Consider either exception as a valid end to the test run
3. Continue to the next iteration after catching either exception

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 74d99199-8f6c-496f-ab89-5d81d5e227e9
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added catch for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception
2. Added print statement to show when game quits gracefully
3. Both exceptions are treated as valid ways to end a test iteration

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both expected ways the game can end during testing:
- When random moves are exhausted (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- When the game ends naturally through loss (_QuitWholeGame)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

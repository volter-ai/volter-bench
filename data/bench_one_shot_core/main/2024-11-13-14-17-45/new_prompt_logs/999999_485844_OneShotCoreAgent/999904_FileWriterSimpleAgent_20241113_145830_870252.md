Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene terminates without properly transitioning to another scene or calling quit_whole_game. According to the error message and engine requirements, we should never just return from a scene - we must explicitly end the game or transition to another scene.

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to:
- When the battle ends (win or lose), call _quit_whole_game() instead of just returning
- This maintains proper scene flow control as required by the engine
- No changes needed to models since this is purely a scene flow control issue

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` before each return in the run() method
2. This ensures proper scene termination through the engine's flow control mechanisms
3. No other changes were needed since this was purely a scene flow control issue

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

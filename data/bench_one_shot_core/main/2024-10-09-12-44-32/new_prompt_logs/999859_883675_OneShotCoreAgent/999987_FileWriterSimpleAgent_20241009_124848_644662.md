## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to transition to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, instead of just returning True.

2. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends, to ensure that the game can be played multiple times without issues.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e34b0ddc-86f7-4ca5-aeac-5f84ccfb8728
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
        
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `run` method now properly exits the battle loop and transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We've added a `reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after each battle, ensuring that the game can be played multiple times without issues.
3. The scene now properly transitions to another scene (MainMenuScene) at the end, which should resolve the FixableException in the whole game flow test.

These modifications should fix the failing tests while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The changes don't affect the models, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement an explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase.
2. Add a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. I'll add a `skill_queue` list to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. In the resolution phase, I'll iterate through the `skill_queue` and remove skills as they are executed.
3. I'll add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.
4. I'll call the `reset_creatures` method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3a81fab3-3dc6-452a-9d4e-6ba9f06ccd30
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You encountered {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        while True:
            self.skill_queue = []
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, choice.thing))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. We now have an explicit `skill_queue` that stores the skills chosen by both players. In the `resolution_phase`, we iterate through this queue and remove skills as they are executed.

2. We've added a `reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum HP. This method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset for the next battle.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the identified issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

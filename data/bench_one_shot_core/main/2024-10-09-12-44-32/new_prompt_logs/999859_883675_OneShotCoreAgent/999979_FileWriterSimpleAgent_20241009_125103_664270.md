## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix these issues, I will:
   a) Add an explicit welcome message display in MainMenuScene.
   b) Ensure that the final damage is explicitly converted to an integer.
   c) Reset the HP of all creatures, not just the player's creature.
   d) Handle simultaneous creature defeats.

2. I will rewrite both the `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` and `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` files to implement these changes.

Here are the updated files:

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. An explicit welcome message is now displayed in the MainMenuScene.
2. The final damage is explicitly converted to an integer in the execute_skill method.
3. The reset_creatures method now resets the HP of both the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
4. The check_battle_end method now handles simultaneous creature defeats.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game. The changes don't affect the models, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You're right, and I understand the issue now. The error occurs because we added a class method to the Player model, which violates the pure data schema requirement. Let's fix this issue by adhering to the guidelines and architecture of the engine.

1. To fix this issue, we need to:
   - Remove the class method `from_prototype_id` from the Player class in `models.py`.
   - Keep the Player class as a pure data schema without any methods.
   - Move the logic for setting the active_creature to the App class in `main.py`, where we create the player.

2. Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 02d5cc5c-4e3d-4a1d-810e-4e26c825869f
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, we need to update the `main.py` file to handle setting the active_creature when creating a player. Here's the updated `main.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: ad287e1a-4932-4423-b0ec-d4137d7de370
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes should resolve the issue while maintaining the pure data schema nature of the models and adhering to the engine's architecture. The logic for setting the active_creature is now handled in the App class methods `create_player` and `create_bot`, keeping the Player class as a pure data model without any methods.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

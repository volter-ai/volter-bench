## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The game flow is not properly handling the end of the battle.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits properly by calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: a0dab78d-cb15-4b3c-9723-6c6b37e018c1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # After the battle ends, transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the scene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to reset the creatures' HP at the beginning of each battle.
3. Maintaining the game loop structure and using the proper methods to transition between scenes.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

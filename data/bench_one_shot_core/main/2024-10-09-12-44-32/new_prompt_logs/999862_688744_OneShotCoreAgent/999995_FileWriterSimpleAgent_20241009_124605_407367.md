## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle_loop method to break out of the loop when the battle ends and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll add a method to display the final battle result before transitioning.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3babd78d-1a55-46be-b8bf-8912986f8d77
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.end_battle()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        self.execute_skill(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player else opponent_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, opponent_skill if first == self.player else player_skill)

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, defender: Player, skill: Skill):
        attacker_creature = attacker.creatures[0]
        defender_creature = defender.creatures[0]
        damage = max(0, attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            result = f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!"
        else:
            result = f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!"
        
        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop ends when a creature's HP reaches zero.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that displays the final result and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Calling `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the battle, which properly exits the scene and prevents the FixableException from being raised.

This solution maintains the existing model structure and adheres to the engine's architecture. It also ensures that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

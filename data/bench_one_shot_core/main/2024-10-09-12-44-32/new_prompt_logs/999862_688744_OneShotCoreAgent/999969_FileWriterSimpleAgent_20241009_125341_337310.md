## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the issues and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities.

1. Describing the fixes:

a) Damage calculation:
We'll adjust the damage calculation to strictly follow the architecture specified in the main_game_scene.md document. This includes separate formulas for physical and special skills, and applying the weakness-resistance factor as the final step.

b) Handling of speed ties:
We'll modify the `determine_order` method to use a random choice when speeds are tied, ensuring equal chances for either creature to go first.

c) Display of available skills:
We'll update the `__str__` method to show only the player's creature's skills, not the opponent's.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 9cb565b5-c416-4106-b045-3816f5276bf4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()

        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle ended in a draw!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The damage calculation now strictly follows the architecture specified in the main_game_scene.md document.
2. The `determine_order` method now uses a random choice when speeds are tied, ensuring equal chances for either creature to go first.
3. The `__str__` method now only displays the player's creature's skills, not the opponent's.

These modifications maintain the architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities while addressing the QA concerns. The models remain pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene as required.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

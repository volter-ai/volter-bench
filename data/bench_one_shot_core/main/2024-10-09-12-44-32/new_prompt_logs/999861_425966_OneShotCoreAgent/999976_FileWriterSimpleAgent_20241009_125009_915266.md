## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both problems: handling equal speeds and using floats in damage calculation. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Equal speeds handling:
   - In the `_resolve_turn` method, we'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
   - If speeds are equal, we'll use `random.choice` to randomly decide which creature goes first.

2. Float-based damage calculation:
   - We'll modify the `_execute_skill` method to use floats for all calculations.
   - The final damage will be converted to an integer only at the end of the calculation.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 88e21e23-2d4d-456b-82c6-d62aedc002d5

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        if self.battle_ended:
            return """===Battle Ended===

        elif choice == quit_game:
            self.battle_ended = True
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `_resolve_turn` method now handles the case where creature speeds are equal by randomly choosing which creature goes first.
2. The `_execute_skill` method now uses floats for all calculations, only converting to an integer at the final step.

Additionally, I've updated the `_get_weakness_factor` method to return float values for consistency.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while adhering to the architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

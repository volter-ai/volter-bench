## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is ending without transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the game loop continues properly.

2. We'll also add a check for the game ending condition in the main game loop, which will call `_quit_whole_game()` if the player chooses to quit.

3. We'll update the `__str__` method of the MainGameScene to include an option for returning to the main menu after the battle ends.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b6827300-6ca0-4b89-b985-5efc6ef6a40d

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        if self.battle_ended:
            return """===Battle Ended===

        if choice == return_to_menu:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            self.battle_ended = False
        elif choice == quit_game:
            self.battle_ended = True
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Updating the `__str__` method to show different options when the battle has ended.
3. Adding a `_handle_post_battle` method to give the player options after the battle ends.
4. Modifying the main game loop to check for the battle end condition and handle post-battle actions.
5. Ensuring that the scene either transitions to the MainMenuScene or quits the whole game, preventing the scene from ending without proper closure.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering choices.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None instead of trying to offer choices.
3. We'll update the `bot_turn` method to handle the case where `choose_swap` returns None.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `choose_swap` method to return `None` if there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. Updating the `bot_turn` method to handle the case where `choose_swap` returns `None`, defaulting to an attack in that case.
3. Adjusting the `player_turn` method to continue the choice loop if no swap is possible.
4. Modifying the `resolve_turn` method to check if an action exists before accessing its elements.

These changes should resolve the `AssertionError` that was occurring when there were no available choices for swapping. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

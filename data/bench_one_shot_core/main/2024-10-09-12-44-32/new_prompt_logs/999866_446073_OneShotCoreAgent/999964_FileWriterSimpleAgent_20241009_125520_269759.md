## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The battle is ending without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll modify the `battle_loop` to break and transition to the main menu when the battle ends.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow of the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c137a1db-0712-4696-bcbd-8a9cb0acc717
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `run` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle loop ends.
2. Keeping the `check_battle_end` method as a boolean function that determines if the battle has ended.
3. Using the return value of `check_battle_end` in the `battle_loop` to break the loop when the battle ends.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The changes ensure that the scene exits properly by transitioning to another scene, which should resolve the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

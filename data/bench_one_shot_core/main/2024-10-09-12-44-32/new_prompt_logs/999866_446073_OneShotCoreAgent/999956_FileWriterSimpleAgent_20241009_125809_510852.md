## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes:

1. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Ensure all intermediate calculations in damage calculations are performed with floats.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class. We don't need to modify the models as they are already correct pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This solution addresses both issues raised:

1. Added a `reset_creatures_state` method that is called at the end of the `run` method, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot to their maximum values.

2. Modified the `calculate_damage` method to ensure all intermediate calculations are performed with floats. All values are explicitly converted to float before calculations, and the final result is converted to an integer only at the end.

These changes align with the architecture description and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas. The implementation now correctly resets the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene and ensures all intermediate damage calculations are performed with floats as specified.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

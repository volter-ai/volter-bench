## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the TypeError in the `_resolution_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to compare tuples with integers when sorting the turn queue. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `_get_action_priority` method to always return a tuple, even for swap actions.
2. We'll adjust the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the new tuple format consistently.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture. It maintains the pure data schema nature of the models and adheres to the guidelines of inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 61c0c8a3-5c12-4943-9be2-1b57e6c571d4

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The main changes are in the `_get_action_priority` method:

1. For swap actions, we now return `(-1, 0)`, ensuring they always go first.
2. For attack actions, we return a tuple `(0, -player.active_creature.speed, random.random())`, which allows for consistent sorting and includes a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.

These changes should resolve the TypeError and ensure that the turn order is correctly determined, with swaps always occurring before attacks and faster creatures acting before slower ones.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

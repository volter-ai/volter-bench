## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that adheres to the architecture documentation and the engine's capabilities.

1. To fix the issue of not using floats for damage calculations, we'll make the following changes:

   a. Modify the `execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class to use floats for damage calculations.
   b. Convert the final damage to an integer only at the end of the calculation.
   c. Ensure that the `calculate_weakness_factor` method returns a float.

   These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. We don't need to modify the models as they are already correct and adhere to the guidelines.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 484d5881-75c4-4dce-8f1e-5df2c3fded97
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2.0,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2.0,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2.0,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self.show_battle_result()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!"
        else:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!"
        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self._show_text(self.opponent, result)
```

These changes ensure that the damage calculations use floats throughout the process, as specified in the architecture documentation. The final damage is only converted to an integer at the end of the calculation, minimizing rounding errors. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly returns float values.

This implementation should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing while adhering to the models, architecture, and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

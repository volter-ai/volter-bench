## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I'll address the issues and propose a solution that adheres to the models, architecture, and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues raised:

   a. Update the type relationships to correctly handle the 'Leaf' type and include the 'Normal' type's effectiveness.
   b. Modify the damage calculation to round to the nearest integer as specified in the architecture.
   c. Ensure all type names are consistent (e.g., 'Leaf' instead of 'leaf').

   These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. We don't need to modify the models as they are already correct and adhere to the guidelines.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 304dd62d-0cad-46af-aec3-f16492365a47
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import math

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(round(weakness_factor * raw_damage))
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("Fire", "Leaf"): 2.0,
            ("Fire", "Water"): 0.5,
            ("Water", "Fire"): 2.0,
            ("Water", "Leaf"): 0.5,
            ("Leaf", "Water"): 2.0,
            ("Leaf", "Fire"): 0.5,
            ("Normal", "Fire"): 1.0,
            ("Normal", "Water"): 1.0,
            ("Normal", "Leaf"): 1.0,
            ("Normal", "Normal"): 1.0,
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self.show_battle_result()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!"
        else:
            result = f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!"
        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self._show_text(self.opponent, result)
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The type relationships now correctly handle the 'Leaf' type and include the 'Normal' type's effectiveness against all types.
2. The damage calculation now rounds to the nearest integer using `int(round(...))` as specified in the architecture.
3. All type names are now consistent, using capitalized names (e.g., 'Leaf' instead of 'leaf').

This implementation should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while adhering to the models, architecture, and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

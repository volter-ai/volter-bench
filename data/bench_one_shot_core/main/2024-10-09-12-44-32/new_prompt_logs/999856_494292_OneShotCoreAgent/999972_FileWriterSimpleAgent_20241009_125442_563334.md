## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue and will address it by modifying the MainGameScene to correctly implement the resolution phase as described in the architecture. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. Implement a separate method to sort the turn queue, placing swap actions before skill actions.
2. For skill actions, sort them based on the speed of the creatures using the skills.
3. In case of equal speed, implement a random tie-breaker.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these fixes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. The `_sort_turn_queue` method now separates swap actions and attack actions, placing swap actions first in the sorted queue.
2. Attack actions are sorted based on the speed of the creatures using the skills.
3. In case of equal speed, a random tiebreaker is implemented using `random.random()`.

These changes ensure that the resolution phase correctly executes swap actions before skills, considers creature speed for skill execution order, and resolves equal speed randomly, aligning with the described architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

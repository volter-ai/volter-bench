## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The random test runs are not consistently reaching an end state (either quitting or transitioning).

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the game loop to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends (either win or lose).
2. We'll add a maximum number of turns to prevent infinite loops in case of unexpected behavior.
3. We'll ensure that the game always ends with either a transition or a quit action.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 0b84fd75-fac6-431a-b6d7-b2caf2c2e68d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.max_turns = 20  # Add a maximum number of turns

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{self._get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        turn_count = 0
        while turn_count < self.max_turns:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            turn_count += 1

        if turn_count >= self.max_turns:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has gone on for too long. It's a draw!")

        # Always transition back to the main menu after the battle
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = max(1, int(weakness_factor * raw_damage))  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `max_turns` limit to prevent infinite loops.
2. Always transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene doesn't terminate without a proper exit.
3. Ensuring that at least 1 damage is dealt in each attack to prevent stalemates.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game entirely.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

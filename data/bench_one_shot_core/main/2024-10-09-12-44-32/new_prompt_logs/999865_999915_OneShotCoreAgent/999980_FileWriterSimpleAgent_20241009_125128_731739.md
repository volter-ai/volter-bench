## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Update the `_get_weakness_factor` method to handle the 'normal' type correctly, which should be neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

2. Modify the `_calculate_damage` method to ensure that the special attack damage is converted to an integer after all calculations are done, not before.

3. Move the `_reset_creatures` method call to the beginning of the `run` method instead of at the end, to ensure that creature states are reset when entering the scene, not when leaving it.

Here's the updated `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: 8383bfd5-06a6-4713-aa2b-8f0817726bed

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'normal' type is now handled correctly in the `_get_weakness_factor` method, always returning a factor of 1.
2. The damage calculation in `_calculate_damage` now converts the final result to an integer after all calculations are done, ensuring that special attack damage is not rounded prematurely.
3. The `_reset_creatures` method is now called at the beginning of the `run` method, ensuring that creature states are reset when entering the scene, not when leaving it.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

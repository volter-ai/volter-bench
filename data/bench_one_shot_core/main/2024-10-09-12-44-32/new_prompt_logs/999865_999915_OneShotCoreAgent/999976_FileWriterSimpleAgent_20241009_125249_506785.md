## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issues:

   a) In MainMenuScene, we'll use `_show_text` to display the welcome message explicitly to the player.
   
   b) In MainGameScene, we'll modify the damage calculation to use floats explicitly before converting to integers.
   
   c) We'll move the creature reset logic to occur when transitioning out of MainGameScene, not at the start of the battle.
   
   d) We'll remove the reset of the opponent's creatures, as it's not mentioned in the architecture.

2. We need to rewrite both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene files to implement these fixes. Here are the updated files:

    def _reset_player_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The welcome message is now explicitly shown to the player in MainMenuScene using `_show_text`.
2. Damage calculations in MainGameScene now explicitly use floats before converting to integers.
3. The state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of MainGameScene, not at the start of the battle.
4. The opponent's creatures are no longer reset, as it wasn't mentioned in the architecture.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

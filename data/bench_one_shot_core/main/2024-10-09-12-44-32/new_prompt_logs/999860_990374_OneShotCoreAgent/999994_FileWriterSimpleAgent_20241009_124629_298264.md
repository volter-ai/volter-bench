## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Explicitly remove skills from a queue during the Resolution Phase:
   - We'll create a queue for skills chosen by both players.
   - In the resolution phase, we'll iterate through this queue, apply the skill effects, and then remove the skill from the queue.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning to another scene.

Here's the updated `MainGameScene` implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 1790e36f-9bde-45bd-bc0f-19a118f249eb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[tuple[Skill, Creature, Creature]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You encountered {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((choice.thing, self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((choice.thing, self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill, attacker, defender = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            defender.hp -= skill.damage

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} received {skill.damage} damage!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{defender.display_name} received {skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. The `skill_queue` is now explicitly managed. Skills are added to the queue during the choice phases and removed from the queue as they are executed in the resolution phase.

2. The `reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their maximum value.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure while addressing the identified issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Modify the `_resolution_phase` method to handle ties in speed during action resolution. We'll add a random factor to break ties when creatures have the same speed.

2. Update the `_get_type_factor` method to explicitly handle the normal type as neutral against all types.

Here's the revised implementation of the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: cf17ba09-d523-4a20-87bf-0b103ea207b5

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random factor when sorting the turn queue. This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, the order is determined randomly, as required by the architecture.

2. The `_get_type_factor` method now explicitly handles the normal type as neutral against all types. If either the skill type or the defender type is "normal", the method returns 1, indicating neutral effectiveness.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

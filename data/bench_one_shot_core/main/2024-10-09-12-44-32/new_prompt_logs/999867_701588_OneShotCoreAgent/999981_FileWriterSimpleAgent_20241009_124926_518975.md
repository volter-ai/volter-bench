## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the `determine_order` method of the `MainGameScene` class. It's trying to use `player_skill` and `foe_skill` variables that are not passed to this method. Let's fix this issue while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture.

1. Description of the fix:

We'll modify the `determine_order` method to only return the order of players and creatures, without including the skills. Then, we'll update the `resolution_phase` method to use this order along with the skills that were passed to it.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: cad1954c-0c60-4607-93a2-6fa4d6dfcc94
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self.return_to_main_menu()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first[0] == self.player:
            self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1], player_skill)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1], foe_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1], foe_skill)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1], player_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `determine_order` method to only return the order of players and creatures, without including the skills.
2. Updating the `resolution_phase` method to use the order returned by `determine_order` along with the skills that were passed to it.
3. Adjusting the logic in `resolution_phase` to correctly apply the skills based on the determined order.

These changes resolve the NameError that was occurring in the `determine_order` method while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The implementation adheres to the architecture guidelines and doesn't require any changes to the models.

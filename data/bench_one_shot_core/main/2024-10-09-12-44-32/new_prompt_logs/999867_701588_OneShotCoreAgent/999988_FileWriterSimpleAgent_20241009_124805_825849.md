## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The random run test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game or transition to another scene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to call this transition method after the battle concludes.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns True when the battle is over.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6638867c-257d-4b91-beeb-7c388b9993f3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self.return_to_main_menu()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1])
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1])

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + attacker_creature.skills[0].base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {attacker_creature.skills[0].display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the battle loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Adding a `return_to_main_menu` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
4. Calling `return_to_main_menu` after the battle loop ends.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, resolving the FixableException raised in the test. The random run test should now pass as the scene will properly exit by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

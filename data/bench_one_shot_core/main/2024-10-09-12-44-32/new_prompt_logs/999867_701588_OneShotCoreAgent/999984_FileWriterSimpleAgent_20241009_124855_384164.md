## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that aligns with the architecture description and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Description of the fix:

The issue is in the `execute_skill` method of the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of using the chosen skill's base_damage, it's always using the first skill in the creature's skill list. To fix this, we need to modify the `execute_skill` method to use the specific skill that was chosen by the player or opponent.

Here's how we'll fix it:

a. Modify the `resolution_phase` method to pass the chosen skills to the `execute_skill` method.
b. Update the `execute_skill` method to accept the chosen skill as a parameter and use its base_damage in the damage calculation.

This solution adheres to the models and architecture guidelines, as it doesn't require any changes to the models and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4b72d50d-979a-4c2a-b090-9c76dcf192b1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self.return_to_main_menu()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1], first[2])
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1], second[2])

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1, player_skill), (self.opponent, creature2, foe_skill)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, foe_skill), (self.player, creature1, player_skill)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1, player_skill), (self.opponent, creature2, foe_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2, foe_skill), (self.player, creature1, player_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `resolution_phase` method to pass the chosen skills to the `execute_skill` method.
2. Updating the `determine_order` method to include the chosen skill in the returned tuples.
3. Changing the `execute_skill` method to accept the chosen skill as a parameter and use its base_damage in the damage calculation.

These changes ensure that the damage calculation uses the correct skill's base_damage, aligning with the architecture description. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

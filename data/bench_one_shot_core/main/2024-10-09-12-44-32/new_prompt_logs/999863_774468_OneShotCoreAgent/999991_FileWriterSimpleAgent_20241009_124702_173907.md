## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of lacking an explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase, we'll make the following changes:

1. Update the `MainGameScene` class to include a skill queue.
2. Modify the player and foe choice phases to add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queue.

These changes will align the implementation with the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's the revised `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 20c7b7a4-625b-4f4f-bb9b-29d7775be383
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

Skill Queue: {', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.skill_queue)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
            
            while True:
                # Clear the skill queue at the start of each turn
                self.skill_queue.clear()
                
                # Player Choice Phase
                self.player_choice_phase()
                
                # Foe Choice Phase
                self.foe_choice_phase()
                
                # Resolution Phase
                self.resolution_phase()
                
                # Check for battle end
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break

            self.reset_creatures()

            # Ask player if they want to play again or return to main menu
            play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
            main_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
            choices = [play_again_button, main_menu_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if main_menu_button == choice:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            elif play_again_button == choice:
                # Reset the battle for a new round
                self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
                self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
                self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
                continue

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        for skill in self.skill_queue:
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.foe_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This revised implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the skills chosen by both the player and the foe.
2. Modifying the `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods to add the chosen skills to the `skill_queue` instead of returning them.
3. Updating the `resolution_phase` method to process skills from the `skill_queue`, executing them in the order they were added.
4. Clearing the `skill_queue` at the start of each turn to ensure a fresh queue for each round of choices.
5. Updating the `__str__` method to display the current state of the `skill_queue`, providing more information about the game state.

These changes ensure that the implementation now includes an explicit queue for skills in the Resolution Phase, as required by the architecture documentation. The rest of the game logic remains intact, and the implementation still stays within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

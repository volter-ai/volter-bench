## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the game correctly, which is causing the test to fail.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. After the battle ends, we'll add a choice for the player to either play again or return to the main menu.
2. We'll implement proper scene transitions based on the player's choice.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until the player chooses to exit.

Here's the revised `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2e6fef97-4e68-4072-af08-aa88bb56a180
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
            
            while True:
                # Player Choice Phase
                player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
                
                # Foe Choice Phase
                foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
                
                # Resolution Phase
                self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
                
                # Check for battle end
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break

            self.reset_creatures()

            # Ask player if they want to play again or return to main menu
            play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
            main_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
            choices = [play_again_button, main_menu_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if main_menu_button == choice:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            elif play_again_button == choice:
                # Reset the battle for a new round
                self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
                self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
                self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
                continue

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This revised implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Wrapping the entire battle sequence in an outer `while True` loop, allowing for multiple battles.
2. After each battle ends, giving the player a choice to play again or return to the main menu.
3. Using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to properly exit the `MainGameScene` and return to the main menu when the player chooses to do so.
4. Resetting the battle state when the player chooses to play again.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by allowing the player to continue playing multiple battles. This should resolve the test failures and improve the overall flow of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in the test. The test is only catching RandomModeGracefulExit but not AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame. When the game transitions back and forth between MainMenu and MainGame scenes, eventually the quit button is randomly chosen in MainMenu, causing an uncaught _QuitWholeGame exception.

The solution is to:
1. Update the test to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Add a TransitionFromScene exception to properly track scene transitions
3. Mock both transition and quit methods to properly track how the scene ends

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 9914585f-0a9e-47f4-bfea-fdb3087146dd
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both transition and quit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame):
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 or game quit, ending run {i}")
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned, ending run {i}")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the caught exceptions
2. Added TransitionFromScene exception to track scene transitions
3. Improved mocking to catch both transition and quit methods
4. Better logging of how the scene ended

This maintains the architecture and capabilities of the engine while properly testing the scene transitions and game quit functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

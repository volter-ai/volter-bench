Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error shows an indentation error in main_game_scene.py where the `run` method appears at the wrong indentation level. Looking at the error, it seems the class definition for MainGameScene is missing. I'll fix this by:

- Adding the proper class definition
- Ensuring all methods are properly indented under the class
- Maintaining all the existing battle logic
- Keeping the same interface with other components

2. Here's the complete fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: c0c0e8b5-5306-4f03-9c66-b2d9ccb81dac

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This fix:
- Properly defines the MainGameScene class
- Maintains correct indentation for all methods
- Preserves all the battle logic and functionality
- Keeps the interface with other components unchanged
- Follows the engine's architecture requirements

The tests should now pass as the syntax error has been fixed.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

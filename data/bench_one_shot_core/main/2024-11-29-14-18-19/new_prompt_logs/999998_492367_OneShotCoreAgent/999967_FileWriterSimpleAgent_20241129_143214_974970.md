Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Fix Description:
The issue is that the resolution phase needs to randomly determine which creature goes first when speeds are equal. Currently, the code just sorts by speed without handling ties. According to the architecture:

"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The solution will:
1. Modify the resolve_turn method to handle speed ties
2. Use random.choice when speeds are equal to determine order
3. Keep all other battle mechanics unchanged

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are in the resolve_turn method:
1. Explicitly compare speeds of both creatures
2. Use random.shuffle when speeds are equal to randomize order
3. Only sort by speed when speeds are different
4. Maintain all other battle mechanics unchanged

This implementation now matches the architecture specification for handling equal-speed creatures while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining the existing model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to reference `self.player_action` and `self.bot_action` in the execute_action method, but these attributes don't exist. This is happening because we're trying to determine the attacker by checking if the action is in a list of stored actions, but we never stored those actions as class attributes.

The fix is simple: Instead of trying to compare the action objects themselves, we should pass the attacker along with the action when we execute it. This maintains clean separation of concerns and doesn't require storing state in the scene.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed resolve_turn to take tuples of (player, action) instead of just actions
2. Modified determine_turn_order to work with these tuples
3. Changed execute_action to take the attacker explicitly instead of trying to determine it from stored state
4. Updated all the related method calls to pass the correct arguments

This maintains clean separation of concerns and avoids storing unnecessary state in the scene while fixing the AttributeError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. Here's how to fix it:

1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `reset()`, we'll directly set the hp back to max_hp in the scene

Here's the corrected models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 1b8a3f40-64cf-495d-9b4b-aa37274b0a25
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

And in the MainGameScene, we'll modify the cleanup method to:

# Excerpt ID: 48be307c-8f96-48de-bfd5-645c490aadbd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def _cleanup(self):
        # Reset HP directly instead of calling a method
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This change:
1. Keeps models as pure data schemas
2. Moves all logic to scenes where it belongs
3. Maintains the same functionality but in an architecturally correct way

The rest of the MainGameScene implementation remains the same. This should resolve the test failures while maintaining the proper separation between data models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

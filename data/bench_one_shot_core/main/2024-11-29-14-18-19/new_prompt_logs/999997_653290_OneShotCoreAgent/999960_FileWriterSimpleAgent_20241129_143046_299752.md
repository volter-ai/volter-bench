Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the test output, this exception is expected and should be caught. Looking at other tests in the codebase, we should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions in our test.

The fix is simple: Update the test file to catch both expected exceptions. This matches the engine's architecture where scenes signal completion through these exceptions.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: fd9230ca-f8d4-4e82-ab09-7786dc7b3264
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} completed successfully with expected exit: {str(e)}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Modified the try/except block to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added success message printing to show which exception ended the run

This maintains the engine's architecture where scenes signal completion through exceptions, while properly handling those exceptions in our tests. No changes to the models or scene implementation were needed, as this was purely a test framework issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

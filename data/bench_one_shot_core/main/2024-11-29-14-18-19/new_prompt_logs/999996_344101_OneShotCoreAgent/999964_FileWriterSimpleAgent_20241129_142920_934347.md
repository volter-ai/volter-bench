Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is returning directly from its run() method instead of properly ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must either transition to another scene or explicitly end the game - they can't just return.

The fix needs to:
- Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends instead of returning
- Keep all game logic in the scene
- Maintain pure data models
- Follow the engine's scene transition requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls before all returns in the run() method
2. Maintained all other game logic and architecture
3. Kept models as pure data schemas
4. Followed engine's scene transition requirements by properly ending the game

This ensures the scene always ends properly through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine's design (looking at test_main_menu_scene.py), we need to:

- Catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `GracefulExit` exceptions
- Add assertions to verify the scene exited properly
- Follow the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py where we patch the exit methods

The fix is to rewrite the test file to properly handle both types of graceful exits and verify the scene's behavior.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: f3b72fe9-9b91-49ab-a433-8a2131b93935
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both exit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition in run {i}")
                except (RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit):
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via graceful exit in run {i}")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `GracefulExit`
2. Added patching of both exit methods (`_transition_to_scene` and `_quit_whole_game`)
3. Added assertions to verify proper scene exit
4. Added debug prints to help track scene exit paths
5. Follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py

This maintains the same test coverage but properly handles the engine's graceful exit mechanisms.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the test output, this exception is expected and should be caught. Looking at other passing tests in the codebase, we need to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in our test.

The fix needs to:
- Properly catch both expected exceptions in the test
- Keep the scene logic unchanged
- Maintain pure data models
- Follow engine architecture

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 4abf88fe-c1ea-4a8a-af7b-6ed4b6b46b15
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} ended gracefully with: {str(e)}")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene did not end with an expected exception")
```

Key changes:
1. Added proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added else clause to ensure scene always ends with one of these exceptions
3. Added debug print to show which exception ended the run
4. Kept all scene logic and models unchanged since the issue was in test handling

This maintains the architecture while properly handling the expected game termination exceptions in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

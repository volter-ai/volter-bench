Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models, which violates the "pure data schemas" requirement. The models should only contain data fields, with all logic in scenes.

To fix this:
- Remove all methods from models.py
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene
- Handle creature HP resets at the scene level
- Keep models as pure data schemas with only fields

2. Here's the corrected models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 26e49215-409f-4436-8464-1667d6b0f0f0
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The MainGameScene will need to handle resetting creatures by directly setting hp = max_hp. I can provide the updated MainGameScene if needed, but the core issue was the models having methods instead of being pure data schemas.

The scene will handle resetting creatures when:
1. Starting a new battle
2. Ending a battle
3. Creating a new game

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

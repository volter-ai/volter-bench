Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py where we're trying to call player.reset() but we removed that method to keep models as pure data schemas.

The correct approach is to:
- Remove the player.reset() call from the test
- Move all creature HP reset logic to the scene level
- Initialize fresh creatures for each test iteration by creating a new player
- Let the scene handle all state management

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5b76aa39-3085-4eb2-bf20-d2707f49193d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            # Create fresh player for each iteration
            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the player.reset() call since models should be pure data
2. Each iteration creates a fresh player with fresh creatures
3. Let the scene handle all state management
4. Maintain separation between data (models) and logic (scenes)

This maintains the engine's architecture while fixing the test failure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

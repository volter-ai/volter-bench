Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help fix this issue. The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods.

1. Solution Description:
- Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- In MainGameScene, instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp`
- This keeps models as pure data schemas and puts all logic in scenes

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Replaced `self.player_creature.reset()` calls with direct HP reset using `self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp`
3. Models are now pure data schemas without any methods
4. All game logic remains in the scene

This should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the same functionality and following the engine's architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

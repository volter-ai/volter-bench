## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to import the scene classes in the `main.py` file. The error occurs because `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` are not defined in the `App` class. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll import the `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` classes at the top of the `main.py` file.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary imports are present and correctly ordered.

Let's rewrite the `main.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 70d1b1f3-c78c-486d-8b7d-d03cc742da17
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("human_player"))
```

This change should resolve the NameError we were encountering. By importing `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` at the top of the file, we ensure that these classes are available when the `App` class is initialized.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas, and it doesn't change the structure of the scenes or the App class. It simply adds the necessary imports to make the existing code work as intended.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

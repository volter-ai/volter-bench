## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not handling the case where creatures have the same speed by randomizing the order of skill execution.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the solution:

   - Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - Implement the skill execution based on the determined order.

This solution aligns with the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as we're only modifying the game logic within the scene.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f0ee095e-b806-4059-b548-8c022336b5a4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = self.player, player_skill, self.opponent, opponent_skill
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player, player_skill
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = self.player, player_skill, self.opponent, opponent_skill
            else:
                first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player, player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_attacker.creatures[0], first_skill, second_attacker.creatures[0])
        if second_attacker.creatures[0].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_attacker.creatures[0], second_skill, first_attacker.creatures[0])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation now handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining the order of skill execution. The `resolution_phase` method has been modified to compare speeds and use `random.choice()` when speeds are equal, ensuring that the requirement from the architecture documentation is met.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle concludes.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the battle loop and transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll show the battle result and then either transition back to the main menu or quit the game.
3. We'll modify the battle_loop to break and call the end_battle method when the battle is over.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

        choices = [
            Button("Return to Main Menu"),
            Button("Quit Game")

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle_loop breaks when the battle ends.
2. Adding an end_battle method that handles the conclusion of the battle.
3. Providing the player with choices to either return to the main menu or quit the game after the battle.
4. Using the appropriate methods (_transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game) to exit the scene properly.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits correctly after each battle, either by transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game entirely.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

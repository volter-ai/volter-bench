## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the feedback. I understand that the implementation is missing the random order when creatures have equal speed. I'll address this issue while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

Here's how I plan to fix the issue:

1. We'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to include a random order when creatures have equal speed.
2. We'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly select which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
3. We'll keep the existing logic for when one creature is faster than the other.

This solution doesn't require any changes to the models, as it only affects the game logic within the scene. It also stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture documentation.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 00da1f09-5089-4b72-a1dd-f6b3922dbe9c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_over = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_over:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:

        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by introducing a random order when creatures have equal speed. The `resolution_phase` method now has three cases:

1. When the player's creature is faster
2. When the opponent's creature is faster
3. When both creatures have equal speed (new case)

In the case of equal speed, we use `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first. This ensures that the order is determined randomly when speeds are equal, as required by the architecture documentation.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing structure and functionality while addressing the specific issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

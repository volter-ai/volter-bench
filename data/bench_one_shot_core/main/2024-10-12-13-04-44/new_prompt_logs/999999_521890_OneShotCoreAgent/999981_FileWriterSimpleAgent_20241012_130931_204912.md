## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle_loop method to break out of the loop when the battle ends and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll add a method to display the battle result before transitioning.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 2fc3ab02-a2a8-42f5-b306-2ece5a345f51
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.battle_result = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.battle_result = "lose"
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.battle_result = "win"
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.battle_result == "win":
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations! You defeated {self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Oh no! Your {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated by {self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}.")
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `run` method always transitions to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Adding a `display_battle_result` method to show the outcome of the battle before transitioning.
3. Updating the `check_battle_end` method to set the `battle_result` instead of immediately showing the result.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by properly exiting the MainGameScene and returning to the MainMenuScene after each battle. The scene will now always transition or quit, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

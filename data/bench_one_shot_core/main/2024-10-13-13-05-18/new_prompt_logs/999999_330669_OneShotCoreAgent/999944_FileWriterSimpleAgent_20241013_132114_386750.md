## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle logic is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a check in the battle loop to break out when a creature's HP reaches 0.
3. We'll ensure that the _resolution_phase method returns True when the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 377bfc8d-df27-492b-8e71-dc7a803b22cc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while True:
            battle_ended = self._battle_round()
            if battle_ended:
                self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
        return self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type, {skill.base_damage} damage)") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
        
        for attacker, defender, skill in [first, second]:
            damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
            defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
            
            attacker_name = self.player.display_name if attacker == self.player_creature else self.opponent.display_name
            defender_name = self.opponent.display_name if attacker == self.player_creature else self.player.display_name
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_name}'s {attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_name}'s {defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")
            
            if defender.hp == 0:
                winner = self.player if defender == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
                return True
        
        return False

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed or (creature1.speed == creature2.speed and random.choice([True, False])):
            return [(creature1, creature2, skill1), (creature2, creature1, skill2)]
        else:
            return [(creature2, creature1, skill2), (creature1, creature2, skill1)]

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a check in the `run` method to break the loop and transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. Ensuring that the `_resolution_phase` method returns True when a creature's HP reaches 0, signaling the end of the battle.
3. Adding a message to inform the player that the battle has ended before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by properly ending the MainGameScene and transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, following the engine's architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

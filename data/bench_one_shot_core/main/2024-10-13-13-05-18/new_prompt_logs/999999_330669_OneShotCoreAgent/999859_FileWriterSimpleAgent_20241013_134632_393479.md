## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the player choice phase.
2. Properly invoke the forced swapping mechanism when a creature is knocked out.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures upon leaving the scene.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, I'll add a 'Back' option when choosing an attack or swap.
2. I'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to check if a creature is knocked out after each attack and invoke the `_force_swap` method if necessary.
3. I'll add a `_reset_creatures` method that will be called in the `run` method before exiting the scene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the attack and swap choice phases.
2. The forced swapping mechanism is properly invoked when a creature is knocked out, using the `_check_and_force_swap` method.
3. The state of the player's creatures is reset upon leaving the scene using the `_reset_creatures` method.

The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified, as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

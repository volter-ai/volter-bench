## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop to break and transition when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 284cb1b3-0509-437a-8327-45116bcccbad
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp = max(0, self.bot_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - bot_skill.damage)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method to ensure the scene always transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends.
2. Keeping the `break` statement in the `game_loop` method when `check_battle_end()` returns True, which will exit the game loop when the battle is over.
3. Maintaining the `reset_creatures()` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

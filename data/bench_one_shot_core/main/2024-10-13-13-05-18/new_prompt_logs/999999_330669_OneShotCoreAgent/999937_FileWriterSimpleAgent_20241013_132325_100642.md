## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to access a `thing` attribute on a `Creature` object, which doesn't exist. This is happening because we're passing the wrong objects to the `_execute_skill` method.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we're passing the wrong objects to `_execute_skill`. We should pass the skill choice (which is a `SelectThing` object) instead of the creature.

2. In the `_execute_skill` method, we'll update the parameter names and types to reflect the correct objects being passed.

3. We'll update the type hints and variable names to make the code more clear and prevent similar errors in the future.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: dabfdb2f-4aef-4b6a-9b35-e0e89ebabc29

        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
```

This solution addresses the issue by correctly passing the `SelectThing` object (which contains the chosen skill) to the `_execute_skill` method, instead of passing the `Creature` object. The `_execute_skill` method now correctly accesses the skill via `skill_choice.thing`.

Additionally, I've added type hints to improve code clarity and prevent similar errors in the future. The `player_choice` and `opponent_choice` attributes are now explicitly defined as `SelectThing` objects in the `__init__` method.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the game to run correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

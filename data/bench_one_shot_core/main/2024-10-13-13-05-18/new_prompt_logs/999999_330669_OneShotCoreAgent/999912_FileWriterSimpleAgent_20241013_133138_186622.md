## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle loop to properly handle the end of the battle and trigger the transition.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: a8392d6d-0d17-47af-a442-5a874863433f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
> Use Skill
"""

    def run(self):
        self.battle_ended = False
        while not self.battle_ended:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.check_battle_end()

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button])
        
        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            return skill_choice.thing
    
    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def determine_turn_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the battle loop.
2. Modifying the `check_battle_end` method to set the `battle_ended` flag when the battle is over.
3. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
4. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle (although it's not used in this implementation, it could be useful for future improvements).

These modifications ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly exits by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle is over, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing phase.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to handle ties in speed randomly. Here's how I'll fix this:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.
2. I'll use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random float between 0 and 1 for each action, which will be used as a tiebreaker in case of equal speeds.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models or the overall architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)

```

This solution addresses the issue raised in the QA/testing by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to handle ties in speed randomly. The change is made in the sorting key of the `actions.sort()` call, where we've added `random.random()` as a tiebreaker. This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, their order will be determined randomly, as specified in the architecture documents.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. No changes to the `models.py` file are necessary, as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to ensure that the state of the player's creatures is reset after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to call the `reset_creatures` method before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll update the `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of both the player's and opponent's creatures.

This solution aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as we're only modifying the scene logic.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 87d1e130-eee9-46d7-9e7e-8d26faa4d6bf
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:

        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Calling the `reset_creatures` method before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. Updating the `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent.
3. Adding a message to inform the player that all creatures have been restored to full health.

These changes ensure that the state of the player's creatures is reset after each battle, as required by the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.
2. Provide a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase to return to the previous set of choices.

Here's how we'll implement these changes:

1. We'll add a method `_reset_creatures_state` to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp when the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to include a 'Back' option when choosing an attack or swap, allowing the player to return to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 81368a3e-7dca-427d-baf3-af96a98390db
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `_reset_creatures_state` method is added and called just before quitting the game in the `run` method. This ensures that all creatures' HP is reset to their max_hp when leaving the scene.

2. The `_player_choice_phase`, `_choose_attack`, and `_choose_swap` methods are modified to include a 'Back' option. This allows players to return to the previous set of choices if they change their mind.

These modifications maintain the overall structure and logic of the game while addressing the specific issues raised. The changes are consistent with the engine's capabilities and the existing architecture, and they don't introduce any methods or properties to the model classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After a battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: ec0cf241-5191-4531-9ea7-a85395718685
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.bot_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, bot_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, skill: Skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.bot_creature.hp == 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop continues until the battle ends.
2. Adding an `_end_battle` method that handles the end of the battle, shows the result, and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Calling `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the battle, which should properly exit the scene and prevent the FixableException.

These changes should resolve both the assertion error in the test_main_game_scene.py and the FixableException in the test_whole_game.py. The scene now properly exits by transitioning to another scene, which should satisfy the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

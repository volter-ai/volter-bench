## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle is ending abruptly without proper scene transition or game termination.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` instead of just breaking the loop.
2. We'll add a method to display the battle result and wait for player input before transitioning.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits properly by either transitioning or quitting the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f8deab66-1198-4104-ac96-6e49818b0040
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._show_battle_result()
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target: Creature, skill: Skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            result = "You lost the battle!"
        else:
            result = "You won the battle!"
        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [Button("Continue")])

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Always transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends, ensuring that the scene exits properly.
2. Adding a `_show_battle_result` method that displays the battle outcome and waits for player input before transitioning.
3. Removing the `break` statement and instead using a `return` after transitioning to exit the `run` method.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the `MainGameScene` always exits in an expected manner, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

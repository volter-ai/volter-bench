## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the attack and swap choice phases.
2. Implement random resolution for speed ties in the resolution phase.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the `MainGameScene`.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. The models in `models.py` will remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.battle_ended = False

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option has been added to both the attack and swap choice phases.
2. The resolution phase now handles speed ties randomly by adding a random tiebreaker when sorting actions.
3. A new method `_reset_creatures_state()` has been added to reset the state of both players' creatures when leaving the `MainGameScene`.

The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models in `models.py` remain unchanged as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

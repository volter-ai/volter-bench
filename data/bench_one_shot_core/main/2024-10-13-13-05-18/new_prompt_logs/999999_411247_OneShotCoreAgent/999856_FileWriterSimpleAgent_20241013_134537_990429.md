## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their maximum values when the battle ends. This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. Add a `reset_creatures` method to the `MainGameScene` class.
2. Call this method before quitting the game in the `run` method.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 1132b5d5-4d2c-49f9-8974-ba385c216197
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp})

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This solution addresses the issue by adding a `reset_creatures` method that restores all creatures' HP to their maximum values. This method is called before quitting the game in the `run` method, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the scene.

This change maintains the current architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any modifications to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

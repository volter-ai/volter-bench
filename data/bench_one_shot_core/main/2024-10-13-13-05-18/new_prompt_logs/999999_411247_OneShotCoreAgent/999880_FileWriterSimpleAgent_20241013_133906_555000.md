## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `MainGameScene` class, specifically in the `get_swap_action` method. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Modify the `get_swap_action` method to check if there are any available creatures to swap to.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of trying to offer an empty list of choices.
3. Update the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to handle the case when no swap action is available.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, which remain pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{player.display_name} has no more creatures available!")
```

This solution addresses the issue by checking if there are available creatures to swap to before offering the swap choice. If there are no available creatures, it informs the player and returns `None`. The `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods now check if the action is `None` before executing it, preventing the error when there are no swap choices available.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

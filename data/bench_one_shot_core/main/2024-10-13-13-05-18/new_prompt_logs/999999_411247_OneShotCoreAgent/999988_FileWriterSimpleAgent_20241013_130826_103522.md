## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the run method to continue the game loop until a transition or quit occurs.
3. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to trigger the transition when the battle is over.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1453743e-4187-4108-904f-e35e61d189da
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._return_to_main_menu()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_player.creatures[0].skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._apply_skill(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._apply_skill(self.opponent, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_skill(self, attacker, skill, target):
        damage = skill.damage
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by ensuring that:

1. The battle loop continues until the battle has ended.
2. After the battle ends, the creatures' HP is reset.
3. The scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle is over.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The game logic remains within the scene, and we use the provided `_transition_to_scene` method to properly exit the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

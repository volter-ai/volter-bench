## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the AssertionError that occurs when `_wait_for_choice` is called with no choices. This error is happening in the `_choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class when there are no available creatures to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the "Swap" option.
2. If there are no available creatures to swap to, we'll only offer the "Attack" option.
3. We'll also add a check in the `_choose_swap` method to handle the case where there are no available creatures, just as an extra precaution.

These changes will ensure that we never call `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list of choices, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 62aede50-2eef-40f0-9333-8e661c46fefe

```

These changes should resolve the AssertionError by ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. The `_player_choice_phase` method now checks if there are available creatures to swap to before offering the "Swap" option, and the `_choose_swap` method has an additional check to handle the case where there are no available creatures to swap to.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. The models in `models.py` remain unchanged as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to compare the current action with `self.player_action` in `execute_action()`, but `player_action` isn't stored as a class attribute. We need to store both actions at the start of the turn and reference them during execution.

The fix will:
- Store both actions as class attributes when they're created
- Reference these stored actions during execution
- Not modify any models or data schemas
- Stay within the engine's capabilities
- Keep all game logic in the scene

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self.current_player_action` and `self.current_bot_action` to store actions
2. Changed `action == self.player_action` to `action == self.current_player_action`
3. Store actions when they're created in the run loop

This maintains all architectural requirements while fixing the AttributeError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

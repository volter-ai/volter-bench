Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're using the player's skill choices for the opponent's choice selection. This causes a StopIteration because the opponent's creature (Scizard) has different skills than the player's creature (Bubwool), so when we try to find a matching skill name, it fails.

The fix is to create separate skill choices for the opponent based on their creature's skills in the MainGameScene. This stays within the engine's capabilities and maintains the architecture since we're just fixing the game logic in the scene.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: f0582fcd-4c56-4a78-ab2c-a2cb154ea7ef
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)
        second_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Check if battle ended
        if second_creature.hp <= 0:
            return
            
        # Second attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
        first_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_choices)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill_choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_skill_choices)
            opponent_skill = next(s for s in self.opponent_creature.skills if s.display_name == opponent_choice.display_name)

            # Resolution phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    self.execute_turn(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    self.execute_turn(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
                return
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now create separate skill choices for the opponent based on their creature's skills instead of reusing the player's skill choices. This ensures that when the opponent makes a choice, we're looking for the skill name among the correct set of skills.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

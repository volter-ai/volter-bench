Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to get a bot's action but there are no valid choices. This happens when we try to swap creatures but all creatures are knocked out. The issue is in the get_player_action method where we don't handle the case of having no valid swap choices.

Solution approach:
- In get_player_action, we need to check if there are valid swap choices before offering the "Swap" option
- If there are no valid swap targets, we should only show "Attack" as an option
- This maintains the engine's capabilities and doesn't require model changes
- Keeps scene logic contained within the scene
- Follows the assertion requirement that _wait_for_choice must have choices

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Modified get_player_action to check for valid swap creatures before offering the Swap option
2. Only show Swap button if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Updated the __str__ to reflect that Swap is conditional
4. Maintained all other game mechanics and architecture

This ensures we never call _wait_for_choice with an empty list of choices while keeping the game logic intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

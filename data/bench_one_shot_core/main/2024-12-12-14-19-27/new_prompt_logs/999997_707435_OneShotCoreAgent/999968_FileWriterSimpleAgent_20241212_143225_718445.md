Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference `player_action` which is not in scope. The issue is that we're trying to determine the attacker/defender by comparing the current action to the stored player_action, but these variables are only available in the resolve_turn scope.

Solution approach:
- Instead of trying to compare actions, we'll pass in the action owner (player/bot) along with the action to execute_action
- This maintains clean architecture and doesn't require any model changes
- Keeps the scene logic contained within the scene
- Follows the engine's capabilities

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added action_owner parameter to execute_action
2. Modified resolve_turn to track and pass the owner of each action
3. Simplified the attacker/defender logic to use the action_owner directly
4. Removed references to global player_action variable

This maintains all the game mechanics while fixing the scope issue that caused the NameError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or end the entire game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when the battle ends, we should return to the main menu using `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`. This creates a proper game flow where players can play multiple battles or choose to quit from the main menu.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a7342b87-1f38-43ea-8514-531ca2e089b5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, 
                    f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
                    f"Dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends, instead of just breaking from the loop. This ensures we follow the engine's requirement that scenes must always end with either a transition or a quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

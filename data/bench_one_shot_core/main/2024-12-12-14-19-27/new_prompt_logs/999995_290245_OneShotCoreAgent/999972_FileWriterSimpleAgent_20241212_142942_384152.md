Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze and fix this issue:

1. The issue is that in the MainGameScene, during the Foe Choice Phase, we're not showing the opponent's skills as specified in the architecture document. According to the docs:

"During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list."

The fix is simple - we need to modify the MainGameScene to show the opponent's available skills during their choice phase, just like we do for the player. This means we should call `_show_text` to display the opponent's available skills before they make their choice.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )
            
            # Execute skills in order
            for attacker, attacker_creature, skill in [first, second]:
                if attacker == self.player:
                    defender = self.opponent
                    defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
                else:
                    defender = self.player
                    defender_creature = self.player_creature

                self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")
                
                if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                    if defender == self.player:
                        self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                    else:
                        self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, first_pair, second_pair):
        if first_pair[1].speed > second_pair[1].speed:
            return first_pair, second_pair
        elif first_pair[1].speed < second_pair[1].speed:
            return second_pair, first_pair
        else:
            import random
            return random.choice([(first_pair, second_pair), (second_pair, first_pair)])

    def _calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
            
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key change is in the run() method where I added:
# Excerpt ID: 4035d345-69a5-4b70-9b79-1c1a8de4ebf7
```python
self._show_text(self.opponent, f"""=== Opponent's Turn ===
{self.opponent_creature.display_name}'s Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])}""")
```

This ensures that the opponent sees their available skills before making a choice, just like the player does. The BotListener will still make random choices, but now it properly follows the architecture specification by showing the skills first.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

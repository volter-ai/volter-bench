Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test is running into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, and when it finally hits quit_whole_game(), the exception isn't caught.

The test should catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions. Additionally, we should patch both transition_to_scene and quit_whole_game in the MainGameScene test, just like we do in the MainMenuScene test.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 73a8be10-e79d-4245-8232-4f32000cd6a2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transition occurred in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode completed run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, \
                           "Scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Verify battle ended properly
                    assert (scene.player_creature.hp <= 0 or scene.opponent_creature.hp <= 0), \
                           "Battle ended without a winner"
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
2. Moved the battle end assertion into the finally block
3. Added proper mocking of both transition and quit methods
4. Added proper exception handling for all possible exit paths

This ensures the test can properly handle all ways the scene might end, whether through transition, quit, or random mode completion, while still verifying that battles complete properly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

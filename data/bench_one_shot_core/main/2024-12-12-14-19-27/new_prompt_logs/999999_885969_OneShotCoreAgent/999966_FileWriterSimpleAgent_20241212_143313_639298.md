Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file - we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the battle ends. According to the engine's design, this is an expected exception that should be caught, similar to how we handle RandomModeGracefulExit.

The solution is to:
- Update the test file to catch _QuitWholeGame exception
- Keep all game logic in scene
- Maintain pure data models
- Follow engine's exception handling patterns

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 81c115e4-e227-4204-9404-1069d65b00cf
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game ended gracefully via _quit_whole_game")
                else:
                    # Battle should end naturally
                    pass

                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added descriptive print statement for when game ends gracefully
3. Maintained existing exception handling patterns
4. No changes needed to game logic or models

This should resolve the test failure while maintaining proper architecture and following the engine's design patterns.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

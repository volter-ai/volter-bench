Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to get a bot's action but there are no valid choices. This happens when all creatures are knocked out but we haven't properly handled that case. The issue is in the MainGameScene's get_player_action method.

Solution approach:
- Add proper checks for valid creatures before presenting choices
- Handle forced swapping when a creature is knocked out
- Add proper battle end conditions
- Keep all game logic in the scene
- Maintain pure data models

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added handle_forced_swap method to handle knocked out creatures
2. Added back buttons to allow canceling choices
3. Added proper checks for valid creatures before presenting choices
4. Check for knocked out creatures at start of each turn
5. Added check to prevent second action if first action knocked out target
6. Maintained all game logic in scene
7. No changes to data models needed

This should resolve the empty choices error while maintaining proper battle mechanics and following the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference `player_action` which is not in scope. The issue is that we're trying to determine if the action belongs to the player or bot by comparing it to a local variable that's out of scope.

Solution approach:
- Instead of trying to compare actions directly, we should pass in the owner of the action to execute_action
- We'll modify resolve_turn to track which player owns which action
- This stays within the engine's capabilities and doesn't require model changes

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Modified resolve_turn to track action owners
2. Changed execute_action signature to take the action owner as a parameter
3. Removed the problematic comparison with player_action/bot_action
4. Added type hints for clarity
5. Kept all game logic within the scene
6. Maintained pure data models

This should resolve the NameError while maintaining the intended battle mechanics and following the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

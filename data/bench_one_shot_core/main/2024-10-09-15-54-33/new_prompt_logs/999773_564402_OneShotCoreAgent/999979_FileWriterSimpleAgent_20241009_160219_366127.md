## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address the problems with the damage calculation method in the MainGameScene.

1. Description of the fix:

We need to modify the _calculate_damage method in the MainGameScene class to:
a) Use int() instead of round() to convert the final damage to an integer.
b) Remove the explicit check for at least 1 damage, as this wasn't specified in the requirements.

These changes will align the implementation with the specified architecture and requirements.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 16a16d50-2921-4d76-b7b0-2ce6a3544cde
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

            "leaf": {"normal": 1, "fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The _calculate_damage method now uses int() instead of round() to convert the final damage to an integer.
2. The explicit check for at least 1 damage has been removed from the _calculate_damage method.

The implementation still adheres to the specified architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. The MainGameScene class continues to inherit from AbstractGameScene, and no changes were made to the models.py file, keeping the data models as pure schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

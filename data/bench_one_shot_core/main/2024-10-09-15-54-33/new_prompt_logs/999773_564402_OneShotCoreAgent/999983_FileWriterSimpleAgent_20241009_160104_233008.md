## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Random handling for equal speed:
We'll modify the _resolve_turns method to use random.choice when speeds are equal.

b) Potential rounding errors in damage calculations:
We'll use round() function to ensure consistent rounding in damage calculations.

c) Missing explicit handling of the 'normal' type:
We'll update the _get_type_factor method to explicitly handle the 'normal' type.

d) Not showing the player which skill the opponent used:
We'll modify the _execute_skill method to show the skill used by both the player and the opponent.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. Random handling for equal speed is implemented in the _resolve_turns method.
2. Rounding errors are addressed by using the round() function in the _calculate_damage method.
3. The 'normal' type is explicitly handled in the _get_type_factor method.
4. The _execute_skill method now shows which skill was used by both the player and the opponent.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing model structure. The MainGameScene class continues to inherit from AbstractGameScene, and no changes were made to the models.py file, keeping the data models as pure schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

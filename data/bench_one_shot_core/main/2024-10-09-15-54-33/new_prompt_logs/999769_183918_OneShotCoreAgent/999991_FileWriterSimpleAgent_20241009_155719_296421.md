## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the issue of not explicitly removing skills from the queue as they are executed, we'll modify the MainGameScene class. We'll introduce a queue for skills and implement a method to remove skills from this queue after execution. Here's how we'll do it:

- Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the MainGameScene class to store the skills that will be executed.
- Modify the choice phases to add skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
- Create a new method `_execute_skill` that will execute a skill and remove it from the queue.
- Update the resolution phase to use the skill queue and the new `_execute_skill` method.

These changes will ensure that skills are explicitly removed from the queue as they are executed, satisfying the requirement in the architecture documentation.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene file:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            self._check_battle_end()

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"{skill.display_name} (Damage: {skill.damage})") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill = self.skill_queue[0]
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, skill)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.foe, self.foe_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, defender_creature: Creature, skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")
        self.skill_queue.pop(0)  # Remove the executed skill from the queue

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self.battle_ended = True

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()  # Clear the skill queue when resetting
```

This implementation addresses the issue by introducing a `skill_queue` and explicitly removing skills from the queue as they are executed in the `_execute_skill` method. The resolution phase now processes all skills in the queue, ensuring that each skill is removed after execution. This change adheres to the architecture documentation requirements while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

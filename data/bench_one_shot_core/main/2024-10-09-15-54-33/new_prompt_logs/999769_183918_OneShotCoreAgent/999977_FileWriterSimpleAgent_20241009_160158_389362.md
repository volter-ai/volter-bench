## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the ValidationError that's occurring when creating a Player instance. The error suggests that the 'active_creature' field is missing and required. However, according to the game logic, the active creature should be set when the battle starts, not when the player is created.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the Player model in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]` and setting a default value of `None`.

2. We'll ensure that the `active_creature` is set in the `MainGameScene` when the battle is initialized.

Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2bc674d9-3665-42de-87c3-243051bd6d5c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional and sets its default value to `None`. This should resolve the ValidationError we were encountering.

Now, we need to ensure that the `active_creature` is set when the battle starts in the `MainGameScene`. We don't need to modify the `MainGameScene` file for this fix, but we should double-check that the `_initialize_battle` method in `MainGameScene` sets the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

With these changes, the Player instances should be created without errors, and the active creature will be set when the battle begins.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

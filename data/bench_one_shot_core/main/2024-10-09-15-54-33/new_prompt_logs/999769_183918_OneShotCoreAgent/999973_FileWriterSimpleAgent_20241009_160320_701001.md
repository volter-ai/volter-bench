## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both the equal speed resolution and the forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.

1. To fix these issues, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll address each problem:

   a. Equal speed resolution:
   - In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
   - This will ensure that when two creatures have the same speed, the order is randomly determined.

   b. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   - I'll add a new method `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` that will be called after each attack.
   - This method will check if the active creature has fainted (HP <= 0) and force a swap if there are available creatures.
   - If no creatures are available, it will trigger the battle end condition.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues:

1. The equal speed resolution is handled by adding a random factor to the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method.
2. The forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the new `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method, which is called after each attack in the `_resolution_phase` method.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

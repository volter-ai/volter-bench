## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Explicitly implement a skill queue for both the player and the bot.
2. Remove skills from the queue as they are executed during the resolution phase.
3. Add a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the updated implementation:

# Excerpt ID: a85c786f-5965-4a77-a9a6-9fa6e7d2ced0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue: List[Skill] = []
        self.bot_skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.damage} damage" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            if player_skill is None:
                return

            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self.bot_turn()

            # Add skills to queues
            self.player_skill_queue.append(player_skill)
            self.bot_skill_queue.append(bot_skill)

            # Resolution phase
            self.resolve_turn()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creature_states()
                return

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return None

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def bot_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self):
        while self.player_skill_queue or self.bot_skill_queue:
            if self.player_skill_queue:
                player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
                self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.bot_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

            if self.bot_skill_queue:
                bot_skill = self.bot_skill_queue.pop(0)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creature_states(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. We've added `player_skill_queue` and `bot_skill_queue` to explicitly manage the skills queued for execution.
2. In the `resolve_turn` method, we now remove skills from the queue as they are executed using the `pop(0)` method.
3. We've added a `reset_creature_states` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value. This method is called when the battle ends, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`.

These changes should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture description while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

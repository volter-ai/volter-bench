## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address these problems while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase for both Attack and Swap choices.
2. Implement a more comprehensive Foe Choice Phase that mirrors the Player Choice Phase.
3. Prioritize swap actions in the Resolution Phase.
4. Reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 728c7081-9bbc-4920-9458-535ba0677183

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. A 'Back' option is now available in the Player Choice Phase for both Attack and Swap choices.
2. The Foe Choice Phase now mirrors the Player Choice Phase, with a similar structure and decision-making process.
3. Swap actions are now prioritized in the Resolution Phase, being executed before attack actions.
4. The player's creatures' state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene, implemented in the `reset_creatures_state` method.

These changes resolve the issues while maintaining the integrity of the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to explicitly manage the skill queue in the Resolution Phase of the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a skill queue to the MainGameScene class to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. In the player choice phases, we'll add the chosen skills to the queue instead of immediately returning them.
3. In the resolution phase, we'll process the skills from the queue and remove them as they are executed.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as the queue management will be handled entirely within the scene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c74b7e70-471b-4331-95bf-ff3a114dfaf5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List, Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Player, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            # Clear the skill queue at the start of each turn
            self.skill_queue.clear()

            # Player Choice Phase
            self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()

        self._reset_creatures()
        
        # After the battle ends, show options to play again or return to main menu
        self._show_text(self.player, "What would you like to do next?")
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        main_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choices = [play_again_button, main_menu_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        else:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        chosen_skill = choice.thing
        self.skill_queue.append((current_player, chosen_skill))

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if attacker == self.player:
                target = self.foe_creature
            else:
                target = self.player_creature
            self._apply_damage(attacker, skill, target)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker: Player, skill: Skill, target: Creature):
        damage = skill.damage
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} dealt {damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `skill_queue` to store the skills chosen by both players.
2. Modifying the `_player_choice_phase` to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them.
3. Implementing a new `_resolution_phase` that processes skills from the queue and removes them as they are executed.
4. Clearing the skill queue at the start of each turn to ensure fresh choices.

These changes explicitly manage the skill queue in the Resolution Phase, addressing the QA issue while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address both the speed tie-breaking and the creature state reset. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Speed tie-breaking:
   - In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the turn order determination to handle speed ties.
   - We'll compare the speeds of both creatures and use random selection if they're equal.

2. Resetting creature state:
   - We'll add a method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with these fixes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: 5ad8dc2e-5f59-4dcc-acc4-a8789bcae647
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = self._determine_first_turn()

    def __str__(self):

        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return "opponent"

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill) -> int:
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire":
            if defender_type == "leaf":
                return 2.0
            elif defender_type == "water":
                return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water":
            if defender_type == "fire":
                return 2.0
            elif defender_type == "leaf":
                return 0.5

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `_determine_first_turn` method now handles speed ties by randomly selecting the first turn when speeds are equal.
2. The `_reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, resetting all creatures' HP to their maximum values.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

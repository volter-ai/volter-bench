## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the FixableException that's being raised when trying to use a Player object as a dictionary key. This is happening because we're trying to use the Player object directly as a key in the `selected_skills` dictionary. Instead, we should use the player's `uid` as the key. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to use the player's `uid` as the key for the `selected_skills` dictionary instead of the Player object itself.
2. We'll update the `player_turn` and `execute_action` methods to use the player's `uid` when accessing the `selected_skills` dictionary.
3. We'll ensure that we're not modifying any models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Using the player's `uid` as the key for the `selected_skills` dictionary instead of the Player object itself.
2. Updating the `player_turn` method to store the selected skill using `current_player.uid` as the key.
3. Modifying the `execute_action` method to retrieve the selected skill using `actor.uid`.

These changes should resolve the FixableException while maintaining the integrity of the Player model as a pure data schema. The game logic remains within the MainGameScene, adhering to the architecture guidelines and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the MainGameScene to correctly implement the Resolution Phase as described in the architecture. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to implement a proper turn-based system where both players choose their skills before the resolution phase.
2. We'll create a new method `_resolve_turn` that handles the resolution phase, including:
   - Determining the order of skill execution based on creature speed.
   - Randomly deciding which creature goes first when speeds are equal.
   - Executing the skills in the determined order.
3. We'll update the `_player_turn` and `_opponent_turn` methods to only select skills, not resolve them immediately.

Here's the proposed solution:

This solution addresses the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `run` method now implements a proper turn-based system where both players choose their skills before the resolution phase.
2. The new `_resolve_turn` method handles the resolution phase as described in the architecture:
   - It determines the order of skill execution based on creature speed.
   - It randomly decides which creature goes first when speeds are equal.
   - It executes the skills in the determined order.
3. The `_player_turn` and `_opponent_turn` methods now only select skills, not resolve them immediately.

These changes ensure that the Resolution Phase is correctly implemented according to the architecture, addressing the issues raised in the QA testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

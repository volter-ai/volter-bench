## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each of these concerns in the MainGameScene implementation. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Explicitly handle the weakness-resistance factor for normal type skills.
2. Check for simultaneous HP reductions leading to ties.
3. Ensure HP values never go below zero.
4. Handle potential division by zero in special skill damage calculations.
5. Round float results before converting to integers.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class, specifically in the `_resolve_skill` and `_calculate_weakness_factor` methods. We'll also modify the `_check_battle_end` method to handle ties.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `_calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles normal type skills.
2. The `_check_battle_end` method now checks for ties when both creatures' HP reach zero simultaneously.
3. The `_resolve_skill` method ensures HP values never go below zero using `max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)`.
4. The `_resolve_skill` method now handles potential division by zero in special skill damage calculations.
5. The `_resolve_skill` method now rounds float results before converting to integers using `int(round(...))`.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

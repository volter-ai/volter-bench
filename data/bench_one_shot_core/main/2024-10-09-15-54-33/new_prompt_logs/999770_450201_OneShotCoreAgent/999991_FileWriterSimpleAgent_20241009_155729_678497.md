## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA report, we need to make the following changes:

1. Implement showing the foe's creature's list of available skills to the opposing player.
2. Manage the removal of skills from the queue as they are executed.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class. We'll modify the `_foe_choice_phase` method to show the foe's skills to the player, and we'll introduce a skill queue system to manage skill execution.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_foe_choice_phase` method, we'll show the foe's skills to the player before the foe makes a choice.
2. We'll introduce a `_queue_skills` method to add skills to a queue.
3. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use the skill queue and remove skills as they are executed.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 208bd0f2-bcd9-4e62-a68a-4a5242c513b6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Queue skills
            self._queue_skills(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        # Show foe's skills to the player
        foe_skills_text = f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name}'s skills:\n{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}"
        self._show_text(self.player, foe_skills_text)

        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]

        return choice.thing

    def _queue_skills(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self.skill_queue = [player_skill, foe_skill]

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, skill)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.foe, self.foe_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, defender_creature: Creature, skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `_foe_choice_phase` method now shows the foe's creature's list of available skills to the player before the foe makes a choice.
2. A skill queue system has been implemented with the `_queue_skills` method and modifications to the `_resolution_phase` method. Skills are now added to a queue and removed as they are executed.

The implementation now aligns more closely with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The core gameplay loop remains intact, and the changes enhance the battle system to better match the described architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the tests to fail because the scene is not exiting properly. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends, to prepare for potential future battles.
3. We'll ensure that all possible paths in the game loop lead to either a scene transition or quitting the game.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f304b4c6-f495-4faa-84c2-2e43c7532cfc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = "player"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

Available Skills:
{self._format_skills()}
"""

    def _format_skills(self):
        if self.current_turn == "player":
            creature = self.player_creature
        else:
            creature = self.opponent_creature
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            if self.current_turn == "player":
                self._player_turn()
            else:
                self._opponent_turn()
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            
            self.current_turn = "opponent" if self.current_turn == "player" else "player"

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self._resolve_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        message = f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}."
        self._show_text(self.player, message)

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. We've modified the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends (when `_check_battle_end` returns True), we reset the creatures' HP and transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We've added a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the HP of both creatures after the battle ends.
3. The game loop now always leads to either continuing the battle or transitioning to another scene, ensuring that the scene doesn't terminate unexpectedly.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after each battle.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the discrepancy between the implementation and the architecture documentation regarding the Resolution Phase.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the MainGameScene to include a queue for skills during each turn. Here's how we'll implement this:

   - Add a `skill_queue` list to store the skills chosen by both players.
   - In the player and foe choice phases, add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
   - Modify the resolution phase to process skills from the queue one by one.
   - Explicitly remove each skill from the queue after it's resolved.

This approach will align the implementation with the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 07cd6a31-55fa-49ff-9f05-87d5252c4a4e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.battle_count = 0
        self.max_battles = 3
        self.skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while self.battle_count < self.max_battles:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle {self.battle_count + 1} of {self.max_battles}")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
            
            while True:
                self.skill_queue.clear()
                
                # Player Choice Phase
                self._player_choice_phase()
                
                # Foe Choice Phase
                self._foe_choice_phase()
                
                # Resolution Phase
                self._resolution_phase()
                
                # Check for battle end
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    break

            self._reset_creatures()
            self.battle_count += 1

            if self.battle_count < self.max_battles:
                continue_button = Button("Continue to next battle")
                quit_button = Button("Quit game")
                choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [continue_button, quit_button])
                if choice == quit_button:
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                    return
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You've completed all battles!")

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]

        self.skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        for skill in self.skill_queue:
            if skill in self.player_creature.skills:
                self._resolve_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, skill)
            else:
                self._resolve_skill(self.foe, self.foe_creature, self.player_creature, skill)
            self.skill_queue.remove(skill)

    def _resolve_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, defender_creature: Creature, skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now includes a `skill_queue` that stores the skills chosen by both players. The resolution phase processes skills from this queue and explicitly removes each skill after it's resolved. This aligns with the architecture documentation while maintaining the game's functionality within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight. You're right, and I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method to the Player model, which violates the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties.

To fix this issue, we need to:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player model in `models.py`.
2. Ensure that the Player model is a pure data schema.
3. Move the logic for setting the active_creature to the appropriate scene or the main App class.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `models.py` file to remove the class method and keep it as a pure data schema.
2. We'll update the `main.py` file to handle the initialization of the active_creature when creating a player.

Let's rewrite the necessary files:

# Excerpt ID: b02eb318-43ac-46e4-9b63-bc6a55520fb4
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, let's update the `main.py` file to handle the initialization of the active_creature:

# Excerpt ID: c9017987-9112-4e52-a46e-dc0e46bfe74c
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the required structure and functionality of the Player model. The 'active_creature' will be set to the first creature when a Player or Bot is created, but the logic for this is now in the App class rather than in the Player model itself.

This solution adheres to the guidelines by keeping the models as pure data schemas and moving the logic to the appropriate place in the application structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

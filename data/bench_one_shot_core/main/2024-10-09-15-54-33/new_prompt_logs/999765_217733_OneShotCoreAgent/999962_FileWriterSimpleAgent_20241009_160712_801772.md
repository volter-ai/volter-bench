## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes in the MainGameScene:

1. Implement the logic for swapped-in creatures to be hit by the opponent's queued skill.
2. Ensure that the final damage calculation explicitly converts to an integer.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to handle the case where a player swaps their creature. If a swap occurs, we'll immediately execute the opponent's queued skill (if any) on the swapped-in creature.
2. We'll update the _execute_skill method to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the int() function.

These changes will maintain the current architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities while addressing the test failures.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```

These changes address both issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we now handle the case where a player swaps their creature. If a swap occurs, we immediately execute the opponent's queued attack skill (if any) on the swapped-in creature.

2. In the `_execute_skill` method, we've explicitly converted the final damage calculation to an integer using `int(raw_damage * type_factor)`.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the game's structure and adhering to the engine's capabilities. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be changed as it already follows the guidelines of being a pure data schema.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.
2. The turn_queue attribute in MainGameScene is not serializable.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene doesn't terminate unexpectedly.

2. We'll remove the turn_queue attribute from the MainGameScene class definition and instead create it as a local variable within the run method. This will prevent serialization issues.

These changes will maintain the current architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities while addressing the test failures.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. We've added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that the scene always transitions back to the main menu after the battle ends.

2. We've removed the `turn_queue` as a class attribute and instead created it as a local variable within the `run` method. We then pass this local `turn_queue` to the methods that need it.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the game's structure and adhering to the engine's capabilities. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be changed as it already follows the guidelines of being a pure data schema.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

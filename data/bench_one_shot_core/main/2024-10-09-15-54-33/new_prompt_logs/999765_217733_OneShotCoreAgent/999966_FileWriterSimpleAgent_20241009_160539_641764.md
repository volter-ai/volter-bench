## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes:

1. Modify the turn order resolution to handle cases where creatures have equal speed by adding a random factor.
2. Ensure that the player's creatures are properly reset when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the sorting key for the turn queue to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
2. We'll move the creature reset logic to the MainMenuScene's run method, ensuring it's called whenever we return to the main menu.

These changes will maintain the current architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities while addressing the test failures.

Let's rewrite the necessary files with these fixes:

These changes address both issues:

1. In the MainGameScene's `_resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include `random.random()` as a tie-breaker when speeds are equal. This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, the order is determined randomly.

2. We've moved the `_reset_creatures` method to the MainMenuScene and call it at the beginning of the `run` method. This ensures that the player's creatures are reset whenever we return to the main menu, regardless of how we got there.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the game's structure and adhering to the engine's capabilities. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be changed as it already follows the guidelines of being a pure data schema.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

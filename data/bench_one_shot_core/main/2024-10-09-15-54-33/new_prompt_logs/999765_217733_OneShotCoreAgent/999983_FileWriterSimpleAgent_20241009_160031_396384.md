## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll do this in the check_battle_end method, which is called at the end of each turn and when the battle ends.
3. We'll create a helper method called reset_creatures to perform the reset operation.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e1f63898-1ccf-408c-abd0-5de7c70cdc2a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution adds a new method `reset_creatures()` which resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. The `check_battle_end()` method now calls `reset_creatures()` before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

This implementation adheres to the guidelines and architecture requirements:
1. It doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.
2. It uses the existing AbstractGameScene methods for scene transitions.
3. It resets the state of creatures within the scene logic, which is where game logic should be implemented according to the guidelines.

This change ensures that when the player starts a new battle, all creatures will have their full HP, maintaining consistency between games and adhering to the requirement specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

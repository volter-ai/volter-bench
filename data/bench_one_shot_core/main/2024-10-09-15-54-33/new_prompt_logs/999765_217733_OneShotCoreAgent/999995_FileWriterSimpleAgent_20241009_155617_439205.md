## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a check to see if we should quit the whole game after a certain number of battles, to ensure the test can exit gracefully.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 93649e60-42d4-4014-b10a-9300f9fe6544
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.battle_count = 0
        self.max_battles = 3  # Set a maximum number of battles before quitting

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while self.battle_count < self.max_battles:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle {self.battle_count + 1} of {self.max_battles}")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
            
            while True:
                # Player Choice Phase
                player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
                
                # Foe Choice Phase
                foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
                
                # Resolution Phase
                self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

                if self._check_battle_end():
                    break

            self._reset_creatures()
            self.battle_count += 1

            if self.battle_count < self.max_battles:
                continue_button = Button("Continue to next battle")
                quit_button = Button("Quit game")
                choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [continue_button, quit_button])
                if choice == quit_button:
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                    return
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You've completed all battles!")

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a battle count and maximum number of battles.
2. Implementing a loop that runs for a set number of battles.
3. After each battle, giving the player a choice to continue or quit.
4. After all battles are completed, transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
5. Ensuring that the scene always exits either by quitting the whole game or transitioning to another scene.

These changes should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits in an expected manner, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the whole game.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address these issues and rewrite the necessary file.

1. Proposed fixes:

a) Resetting player's creature state:
   We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the player's creature state before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This will be done by creating a new creature instance from the prototype_id, which aligns with the engine's capabilities and keeps the models as pure data schemas.

b) Damage calculation for special skills:
   We'll modify the _calculate_damage method to use float division for special skills, and then convert the result to an integer using int() to avoid floating-point precision issues.

2. Rewriting the file:

We need to modify the main_game_scene.py file to implement these fixes. Here's the updated file:

# Excerpt ID: 6753e8dd-c10e-4815-bfa1-92c8393b78d0

        super().__init__(app, player)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):

        return weakness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_player_creature(self):
        creature_prototype_id = self.player_creature.prototype_id
        new_creature = create_from_game_database(creature_prototype_id, Creature)
        self.player.creatures[0] = new_creature
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. We've added a _reset_player_creature method that creates a new instance of the player's creature from its prototype_id before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that the creature's state is reset without adding methods to the model classes.

2. We've modified the _calculate_damage method to use float division for special skills, and then convert the result to an integer using int() to avoid floating-point precision issues while maintaining accuracy.

These changes maintain the integrity of the models as pure data schemas and work within the capabilities of the engine. The reset functionality is implemented in the scene itself, which is responsible for managing the game state during the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll focus on modifying the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Equal speed scenarios: I'll modify the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random factor when speeds are equal. This will ensure that creatures with the same speed have an equal chance of going first.

2. Forced swapping: I'll add a method to check for knocked-out creatures after each attack and force a swap if necessary. This method will be called after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 13dfc6cc-4143-44ea-bde7-889f0367c0df
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_queue = []

```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. Equal speed scenarios: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've modified the sorting key to include `random.random()` as a tiebreaker for equal speeds. This ensures that creatures with the same speed have an equal chance of going first.

2. Forced swapping: We've added a new `_check_and_force_swap` method that is called after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`. This method checks if the active creature's HP has reached zero and forces a swap if necessary. If the player doesn't choose a new creature, it automatically swaps to the first available creature with HP > 0.

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed QA feedback. I understand that there are two main issues to address: the absence of the 'Leaf' type in type relationships and potential rounding errors in damage calculation. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to include all type relationships, specifically adding the 'Leaf' type.
2. Modify the damage calculation in the `execute_skill` method to ensure that all operations are performed using floats before rounding to an integer at the very end.

These changes will be made within the `main_game_scene.py` file, staying within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models or overall architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now correctly handles all type relationships, including the 'Leaf' type.
2. The damage calculation in the `execute_skill` method now uses floats for all calculations and rounds down to an integer at the very end using `math.floor()`. This ensures that all operations are performed with floating-point precision before converting to an integer, avoiding potential rounding errors due to the order of operations.

These modifications ensure that the game logic aligns with the specified requirements while maintaining the overall structure and architecture of the game. The models remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas inheriting from the appropriate abstract classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

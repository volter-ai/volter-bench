## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each problem and propose a solution that stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the current architecture. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Equal speed scenarios: We'll modify the sorting key in the resolution phase to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
2. Final damage calculation: We'll explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the `int()` function.
3. Type factor for ineffective attacks: We'll change the 0.5 factor to 1/2 as specified in the architecture.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file, specifically in the `_resolution_phase` and `_calculate_damage` methods. The models will remain unchanged as they are pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random factor in the sorting key to handle equal speed scenarios.
2. The `_calculate_damage` method explicitly converts the final damage to an integer using `int()`.
3. The `_get_type_factor` method now uses `1/2` instead of `0.5` for ineffective attacks.

These modifications maintain the current architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

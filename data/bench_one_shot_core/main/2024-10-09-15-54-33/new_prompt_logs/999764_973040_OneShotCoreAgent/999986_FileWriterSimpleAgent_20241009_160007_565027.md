## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal.
2. Add the Leaf type to the weakness-resistance calculations.

Here's how I will fix these issues:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, I'll add a condition to randomly decide the execution order when speeds are equal.
2. In the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, I'll add the missing Leaf type calculations.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models or architecture.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: f71209b0-3d78-461c-9397-77ee765e092f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:

        else:
            # Random decision when speeds are equal
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):

                return 2
            elif defender_type == "water":
                return 0.5

    def end_battle(self):

            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now includes a random decision when creature speeds are equal, using `random.choice([True, False])` to determine the order of skill execution.

2. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now includes all type relationships, including the Leaf type, ensuring that all weakness and resistance calculations are correctly implemented.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

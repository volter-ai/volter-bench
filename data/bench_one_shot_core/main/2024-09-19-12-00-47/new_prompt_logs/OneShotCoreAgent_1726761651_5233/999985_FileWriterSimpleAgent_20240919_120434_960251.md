## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `perform_swap` method in the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to access `opponent_action[0]` when `opponent_action` is `None`. This happens during forced swaps when a creature is knocked out. We'll update the method to handle cases where `opponent` or `opponent_action` might be `None`.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll check if both `opponent` and `opponent_action` are not `None` before trying to execute the opponent's queued skill.
2. We'll move the swap logic into a separate method to avoid duplication.
3. We'll update the `force_swap` method to pass `None` for both `opponent` and `opponent_action`.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Modifying the `perform_swap` method to check if both `opponent` and `opponent_action` are not `None` before trying to execute the opponent's queued skill.
2. Creating a new `_swap_creature` method to handle the actual swapping logic, which is now used by both `perform_swap` and `force_swap`.
3. Updating the `force_swap` method to use `_swap_creature` instead of `perform_swap`, avoiding the need to pass `None` values.

These modifications should resolve the TypeError while maintaining the existing architecture and adhering to the engine's capabilities. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each problem and propose a solution that adheres to the given architecture and engine capabilities. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Randomly resolve actions for creatures with equal speed:
   We'll modify the resolution_phase method to randomly shuffle actions when creatures have equal speed.

2. Execute the opponent's queued skill on swapped-in creatures:
   We'll update the perform_swap method to execute the opponent's queued skill immediately after swapping.

3. Add the 'Leaf' type to the type effectiveness dictionary:
   We'll update the get_type_effectiveness method to include all type relationships, including 'Leaf'.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class within the main_game_scene.py file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now randomly shuffles actions for creatures with equal speed using `random.random()`.
2. The `perform_swap` method now executes the opponent's queued skill on the swapped-in creature.
3. The `get_type_effectiveness` method now includes all type relationships, including 'Leaf'.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies while maintaining the existing architecture and adhering to the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid choices. This happens because:
- We're not checking if there are any available creatures before trying to show swap choices
- We need to handle the case where a player has no valid swaps differently

The fix should:
- Only offer "Swap" as a choice if there are valid creatures to swap to
- Only try to get swap choices if we confirmed there are valid creatures
- Stay within the engine's capabilities by using the existing choice system
- Keep models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_creatures` helper method to centralize the logic for finding valid swap targets
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show "Swap" option if there are available creatures
3. Updated the scene's `__str__` to only show "Swap" in available actions if there are creatures to swap to
4. Used the same `get_available_creatures` method in forced swap logic
5. No changes to models were needed since they remain pure data schemas

This fix ensures we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player while maintaining the game's core mechanics and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:

The QA identified two issues:
a) Missing "Back" option in player choice phase
b) No random order handling for same-speed creatures

To fix these, I will:
1. Add a "Back" button in the attack/swap submenus
2. Modify the speed sorting to include random tiebreaking
3. Keep all models as pure data schemas
4. Stay within engine capabilities using existing choice mechanisms

The fix only requires changes to main_game_scene.py since these are gameplay logic issues, not model issues.

2. Here's the fixed file:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
2. Implemented a while loop in get_player_action to handle returning to main menu when "Back" is selected
3. Modified the speed sorting to include random.random() as a tiebreaker
4. No changes to models were needed since these were purely gameplay logic changes

The implementation now fully matches the requirements while maintaining the engine's architecture and keeping models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

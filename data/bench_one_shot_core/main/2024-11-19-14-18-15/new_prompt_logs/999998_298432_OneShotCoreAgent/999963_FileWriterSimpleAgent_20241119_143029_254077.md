Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because when MainGameScene transitions back to MainMenuScene, the menu scene is quitting the game, which raises an AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception. This exception needs to be caught in the test.

The test should:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Reset creature HP after each iteration regardless of how the test ends
3. Handle both normal battle completion and random mode timeout cases

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 022a433b-a3d5-4128-947c-88c8c78b26f9
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit after battle completion. Ending run {i}")
            finally:
                # Always reset creature HP for next iteration
                for creature in player.creatures:
                    creature.hp = creature.max_hp
                for creature in main_game_scene.opponent.creatures:
                    creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The key changes are:

1. Added catch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added appropriate logging for both exit conditions
3. Moved HP reset to finally block to ensure it happens regardless of exit condition

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both ways the scene can end:
- Random mode timeout (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- Battle completion leading to menu quit (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass since it properly handles all expected exit conditions while maintaining creature state between iterations.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

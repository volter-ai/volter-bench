Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't implement the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the documentation. According to the docs:

> When the player chooses "Attack", the player's active creature's skills are shown as choices... The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

To fix this, we need to:
- Add a "Back" button in the skill selection menu
- Modify get_attack_choice to handle the back button by recursively calling get_player_action
- Keep the same pattern for the swap menu
- Use Button for the "Back" option since it's a UI control rather than a game entity

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both get_attack_choice and get_swap_choice
2. Implemented recursive return to get_player_action when "Back" is chosen
3. Maintained proper type safety using Button for UI controls
4. Preserved all existing game mechanics while adding the back functionality

This implementation now fully matches the documentation requirements while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining proper model inheritance.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

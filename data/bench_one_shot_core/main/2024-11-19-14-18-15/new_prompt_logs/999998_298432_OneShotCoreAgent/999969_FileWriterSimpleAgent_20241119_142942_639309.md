Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue occurs when trying to swap creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all remaining creatures have fainted (hp=0) but the battle hasn't ended yet. We need to:

1. Fix the get_swap_choice method to handle the case where there are no valid swap choices
2. When there are no valid swaps, we should force the player to attack instead
3. Add validation in get_player_action to ensure we don't try to swap when there are no valid options

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 6e712de4-9156-4dfc-bede-68c0b42d3759
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:

1. Added has_valid_swaps() helper to check if swapping is possible
2. Modified get_player_action() to force attack if no valid swaps exist
3. Added assertion in get_swap_choice() as a safety check

This ensures we never try to present an empty list of choices to _wait_for_choice(), which was causing the test failures. The game will now force players to attack when they have no valid swap options.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends, it just returns from the game loop instead of explicitly calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must end with one of these calls.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when the battle ends (in `_check_battle_end()`), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the winner. This follows the game flow where a battle ending should end the entire game session.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` in the `_check_battle_end` method when a winner is determined. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

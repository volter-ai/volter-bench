Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught when quitting the game. Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it handles this by catching both RandomModeGracefulExit and GracefulExit (which _QuitWholeGame inherits from).

The fix is to update test_main_game_scene.py to properly catch both exceptions, similar to how test_main_menu_scene.py handles it.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: a58c86f3-c630-4b75-92fc-bf66b494ae37
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except GracefulExit:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully during run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added catch for GracefulExit (which _QuitWholeGame inherits from)
2. Added appropriate message for graceful exit case

This maintains the architecture while properly handling the expected exception from quitting the game. The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways a scene can end:
- RandomModeGracefulExit when the counter runs out
- GracefulExit when the game quits normally

No changes to models or other files are needed since this was purely a test framework issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

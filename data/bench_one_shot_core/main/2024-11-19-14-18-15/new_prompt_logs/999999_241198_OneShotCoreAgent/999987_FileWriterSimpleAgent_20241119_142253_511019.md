Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: After a battle ends, we should either:
- Return to the main menu (transition)
- End the game (quit)

Since this is a simple game, it makes sense to end the game after a battle concludes. I'll modify MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the battle result.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: b27db515-bd5a-48a4-b317-b2eaa65bae0d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            # Execute moves
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()

            self._execute_skill(*second)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, move1, move2):
        p1, c1, _ = move1
        p2, c2, _ = move2
        
        if c1.speed > c2.speed:
            return move1, move2
        elif c2.speed > c1.speed:
            return move2, move1
        else:
            return (move1, move2) if random.random() < 0.5 else (move2, move1)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self._get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def _get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def _execute_skill(self, player, attacker, skill):
        if player == self.player:
            defender = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender = self.player_creature
            
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` after detecting a battle has ended. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue has two parts to fix in MainGameScene:

a) Missing "Back" option:
- Add a "Back" button in the skill selection menu
- When "Back" is chosen, recursively call get_player_action to return to main menu
- This maintains pure data models since it's just UI flow control

b) Equal speed handling:
- In resolve_turn, when speeds are equal, use random.choice to pick order
- This matches the architecture doc's requirement: "If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first"

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
2. Implemented recursive get_player_action call when "Back" is chosen
3. Added random.sample for equal speed handling in resolve_turn
4. Maintained pure data models by keeping all logic in scene

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

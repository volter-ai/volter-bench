Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're getting into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. When testing MainGameScene directly, we need to catch the scene transitions and quit exceptions properly, similar to how we do in the MainMenuScene test.

The solution is to modify the test file to:
1. Mock both `_transition_to_scene` and `_quit_whole_game`
2. Catch both TransitionFromScene and QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Consider either a transition or quit as a valid end to the scene test

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 4761e00f-1b8b-41f3-9e9a-128d57374cce
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both exit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting via quit in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("quit game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("transition called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added catch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
2. Properly mocked both exit methods
3. Added proper cleanup in finally block
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This ensures the test can properly handle any valid way the scene might end, whether through transition or quit, without getting into an infinite loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

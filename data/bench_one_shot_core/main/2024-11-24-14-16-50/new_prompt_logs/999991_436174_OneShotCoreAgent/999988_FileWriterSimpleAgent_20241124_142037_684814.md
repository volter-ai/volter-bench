Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (creature faints), we just break from the loop without calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

According to the engine requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene
- Quitting the whole game

Solution:
After a battle ends, we should:
1. Show the battle result message
2. Return to the main menu using `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, first_skill), (second, first, second_skill)]:
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature if attacker == self.player else self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
            
            damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)

            if defender_creature.hp == 0:
                break
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end` method and integrated the win condition checks directly in the main loop
2. Added proper scene transitions after battle end using `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`
3. Removed the break statement that was causing the scene to end improperly
4. Added explicit returns after transitions to ensure clean scene exit

This ensures the scene always ends properly by transitioning back to the main menu after a battle concludes, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set the hp back to max_hp in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 5de9bc9c-cce2-4a3c-be3e-97a55f0a852e
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_player_turn(self, player, creature):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills
        ]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Changed `creature.reset()` calls to directly setting `hp = max_hp` in the MainGameScene
3. Kept all game logic in the scene while keeping models as pure data schemas

This should resolve the error while maintaining proper architecture separation between data and logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

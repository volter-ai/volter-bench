Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Creature model requires an `hp` field but it's not being set in the JSON data. Looking at the models.md documentation, we see that `hp` should be initialized from `max_hp`. However, we can't add methods to models.py since models must be pure data schemas.

The solution is to modify the Creature model to:
1. Make `hp` an optional field that defaults to None
2. Move the hp initialization logic to the JSON data itself by including both hp and max_hp fields

This stays within the engine's capabilities while maintaining pure data schemas.

Here's the fixed implementation:

# Excerpt ID: f66c2e57-666b-471e-993f-86885879a21f
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int  
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And we need to update the creature.json to include hp:

# Excerpt ID: cc251ebc-e09e-4315-a15b-49f6061f9a83
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 32,
      "max_hp": 32,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 10,
      "sp_attack": 12,
      "sp_defense": 12,
      "speed": 13,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard",
      "description": "A fire creature",
      "creature_type": "fire",
      "hp": 40,
      "max_hp": 40,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 13,
      "sp_attack": 11,
      "sp_defense": 13,
      "speed": 11,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    },
    "dumbird": {
      "display_name": "Dumbird",
      "description": "A normal creature",
      "creature_type": "normal",
      "hp": 17,
      "max_hp": 17,
      "attack": 7,
      "defense": 9,
      "sp_attack": 7,
      "sp_defense": 4,
      "speed": 17,
      "skills": ["tackle"]
    }
  }
}
```

This solution:
1. Keeps models as pure data schemas
2. Moves initialization logic to the data layer
3. Maintains the engine's capabilities
4. Fixes the validation error by providing hp in the JSON data
5. Still allows hp to be modified during gameplay since it's a mutable field

The error occurred because we were trying to initialize hp in the model's __init__, which violates the pure data schema requirement. By moving this to the JSON data, we maintain separation of concerns while fixing the validation error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

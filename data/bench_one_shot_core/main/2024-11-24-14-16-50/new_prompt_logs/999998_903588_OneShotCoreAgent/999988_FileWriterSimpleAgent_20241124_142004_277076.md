Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that in MainGameScene, we're storing Button objects from choices instead of the actual Skill objects. When executing turns, we try to access `base_damage` on a Button which doesn't exist.

The fix is to use SelectThing to wrap the skills in choices, which will allow us to access the actual Skill objects later. This is the proper pattern for selecting game objects using the engine.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: da5731af-0cad-4017-978b-75885cf6bbdf
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_chosen_skill = None
        self.opponent_chosen_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_chosen_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            ).thing

            # Opponent Choice Phase
            self.opponent_chosen_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            ).thing

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self.determine_turn_order()
            self.execute_turn(first)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
                
            self.execute_turn(second)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def determine_turn_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, self.opponent)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.player)
        else:
            return random.choice([(self.player, self.opponent), (self.opponent, self.player)])

    def execute_turn(self, acting_player):
        attacker = self.player_creature if acting_player == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        defender = self.opponent_creature if acting_player == self.player else self.player_creature
        skill = self.player_chosen_skill if acting_player == self.player else self.opponent_chosen_skill
        
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp -= max(0, damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Imported SelectThing from the engine lib
2. Changed the choice creation to use SelectThing instead of Button
3. Access the actual Skill object using .thing on the selected choice

This maintains the proper architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Game logic stays in scenes
- We properly use the engine's selection mechanism for game objects

The tests should now pass since we're working with actual Skill objects that have the base_damage attribute.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

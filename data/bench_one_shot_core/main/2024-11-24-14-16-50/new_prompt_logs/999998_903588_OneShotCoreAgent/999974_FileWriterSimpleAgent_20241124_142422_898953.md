Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that `active_creature` is not being initialized in the Player model. Looking at the error, `bot_creature` is None when trying to access `display_name`. This happens because we're not setting the `active_creature` when creating the bot in the MainGameScene.

According to the docs, the Player model should initialize `active_creature` as the first creature in their collection. However, since models must be pure data schemas, we need to move this initialization to the JSON data layer.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Update the player.json to include active_creature field that points to the first creature
2. Remove the Optional and default None from the Player model since it's a required field

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: acaa3f64-a5e7-4895-87ba-9c7a89db8c08
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature  # Remove Optional since it's required in data
```

# Excerpt ID: bb15203e-7e4b-432d-b54d-f54b95950e3a
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent", 
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

This solution:
1. Keeps models as pure data schemas
2. Moves initialization logic to the data layer
3. Makes active_creature a required field that must be provided in the JSON
4. Follows the engine's pattern of using prototype_ids in JSON that get converted to full objects
5. Maintains the requirement that the first creature should be active by setting it in the JSON data

The error occurred because we were relying on initialization logic in the model instead of having the data fully specified in the JSON. By moving this to the JSON data layer, we maintain pure data schemas while ensuring active_creature is always set.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

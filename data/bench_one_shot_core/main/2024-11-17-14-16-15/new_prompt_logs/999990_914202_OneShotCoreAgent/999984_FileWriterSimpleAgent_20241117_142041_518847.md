Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how the test_main_menu_scene.py handles it.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it patches the quit and transition methods and catches the exceptions properly. We should follow the same pattern for test_main_game_scene.py.

The solution is to:
1. Patch both _quit_whole_game and _transition_to_scene methods
2. Catch both the RandomModeGracefulExit and the _QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Verify that one of the exit methods was called
4. Reset mocks between iterations

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene's behavior.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 36ededec-49b1-4926-a607-5ddd3de9c938
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except (TransitionFromScene, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit) as e:
                    print(f"Scene ended with: {type(e).__name__}")
                finally:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene did not exit properly"
                    
                    # Reset mocks for next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This solution:
1. Maintains the engine's architecture
2. Properly tests scene exit conditions
3. Follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py
4. Handles all expected exceptions
5. Verifies proper scene termination
6. Keeps test iterations independent

The test will now pass while maintaining proper testing of the scene's behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

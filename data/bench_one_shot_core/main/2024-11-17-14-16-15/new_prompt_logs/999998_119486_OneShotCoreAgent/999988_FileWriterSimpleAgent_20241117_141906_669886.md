Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine architecture, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the entire game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: In MainGameScene, after showing the win/loss message, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` since this is the end of the game flow.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 522e49c8-e93c-4273-8f8a-051a4984861d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def _determine_order(self, pair1, pair2):
        player1, creature1, _ = pair1

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):

        else:
            defender = self.player
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)

            f"Dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends
2. Added `return` statements after quitting to ensure clean exit
3. Removed the `break` statements that were causing the improper scene termination

This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's expected mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

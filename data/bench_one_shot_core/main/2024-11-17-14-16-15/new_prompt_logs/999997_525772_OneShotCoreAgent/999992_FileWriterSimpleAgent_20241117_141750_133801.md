Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the MainGameScene's test isn't properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception. According to the engine's architecture, we need to:

- Catch both possible exit conditions in the test: TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame
- Similar to MainMenuScene's test, we should verify that the scene exits properly through either transition or quit
- The test should track that the scene exited properly through one of these methods

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: be207248-da09-4990-a78c-3446b2caa59f
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transition detected. Ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit detected. Ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene did not exit properly"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added mocking of both exit methods (_transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game)
3. Added verification that the scene exits through one of these methods
4. Added proper cleanup in finally block

This maintains the engine's architecture requirements while properly testing both possible exit conditions from the battle scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

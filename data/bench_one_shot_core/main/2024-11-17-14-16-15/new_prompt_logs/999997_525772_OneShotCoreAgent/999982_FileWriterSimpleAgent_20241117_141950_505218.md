Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine architecture, _QuitWholeGame is an expected exception that should be caught when a scene ends via quit_whole_game().

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see the correct pattern - we should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions in our test.

The fix is simple: update the test file to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception alongside RandomModeGracefulExit.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5e0e09ae-960d-437f-ba9c-0a6e3378dc46
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game quits gracefully
4. Maintained all other test functionality

This maintains the engine architecture while properly handling the expected quit behavior in tests. The MainGameScene itself is correct in using _quit_whole_game() to end the game - we just needed to handle that expected behavior in our test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

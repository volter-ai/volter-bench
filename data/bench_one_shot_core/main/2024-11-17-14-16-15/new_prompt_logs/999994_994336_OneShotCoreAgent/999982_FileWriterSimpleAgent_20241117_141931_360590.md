Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine architecture, every scene must either:
1. Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`, or 
2. End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

In our case, when the battle ends (either player wins or loses), we should quit the whole game since this is a simple game loop. We need to modify the MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the win/loss message.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 27a76e1e-4ed2-429b-b797-a0ff9e6eb773
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            # Execute skills in order
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Added proper game end

            self._execute_skill(*second)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Added proper game end

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, pair1, pair2):
        player1, creature1, _ = pair1
        player2, creature2, _ = pair2
        
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return pair1, pair2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return pair2, pair1
        else:
            return random.choice([(pair1, pair2), (pair2, pair1)])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender = self.opponent
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender = self.player
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)

        # Apply damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
            f"Dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls after both battle end checks
2. This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's expected mechanisms
3. Maintains the same game logic but now properly signals game completion

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged as the issue was specifically about scene termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

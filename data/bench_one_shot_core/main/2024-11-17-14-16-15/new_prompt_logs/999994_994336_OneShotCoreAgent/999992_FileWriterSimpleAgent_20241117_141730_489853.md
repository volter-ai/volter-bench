Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that MainGameScene is returning directly when the battle ends, instead of transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the error message and engine requirements, we must either:
- Call _transition_to_scene() to go to another scene
- Call _quit_whole_game() to end the game properly

Since this is a simple game, after a battle ends (win or lose), we should return to the main menu. This maintains good UX and follows the engine's requirements.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 6429e6d6-192b-4add-9e90-320017c9cbe3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A battle begins between {self.player_creature.display_name} and {self.bot_creature.display_name}!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"The foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after win
                
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after loss
```

The key changes are:
1. Replaced the direct returns with _transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
2. This ensures the scene properly transitions back to the main menu after battle ends
3. Maintains the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit
4. Keeps the same battle logic but handles scene transitions correctly

This should resolve the FixableException while maintaining proper game flow.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the `_QuitWholeGame` exception is not being caught in the test. According to the engine architecture, when testing scenes that can quit the game, we need to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `GracefulExit` (which includes `_QuitWholeGame`).

The solution is to modify the test file to:
1. Import GracefulExit from the engine lib
2. Add GracefulExit to the exception handling
3. Keep the same test logic but properly handle both possible exit conditions

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: a22a9a8d-cf73-4fd9-b896-60590f7cf38f
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except GracefulExit:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Properly handles both types of graceful exits
2. Maintains the engine's architecture and testing patterns
3. Keeps the same test logic but adds proper exception handling
4. Follows the engine's expected behavior for scene termination

The main game scene itself is correct in using `_quit_whole_game()` - we just needed to handle the exception properly in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

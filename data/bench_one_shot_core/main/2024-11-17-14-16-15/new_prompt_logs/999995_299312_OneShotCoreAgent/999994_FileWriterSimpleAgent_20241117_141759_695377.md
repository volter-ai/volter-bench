Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that we need to reset creature HP when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. Looking at the architecture:

- We can't add methods to models since they must be pure data schemas
- The scene is responsible for managing game state
- We need to reset HP to max_hp before transitioning

The solution is to add a reset method in MainGameScene that restores creatures to their original state before transitioning. This should happen in both win and loss conditions.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: f5ac5c72-6748-49b8-8cdc-02243398f700
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Battle starts against {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_turn(self.player, self.player_creature)
            bot_skill = self._handle_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_skills(player_skill, bot_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _handle_turn(self, current_player: Player, creature: Creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_skills(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply player skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Foe's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        # Apply bot skill if still alive
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, f"Your {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        # Reset both player and bot creatures to their original state
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
            self._reset_creatures()  # Reset before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
            self._reset_creatures()  # Reset before transitioning
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `_reset_creatures()` method to restore HP to max_hp
2. Called `_reset_creatures()` before transitioning in both win and loss conditions
3. This ensures creatures are restored to their original state before leaving the battle scene

This solution:
- Keeps models as pure data schemas
- Handles state management in the scene
- Follows the engine's capabilities
- Meets the architecture requirements
- Fixes the missing functionality identified in QA

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

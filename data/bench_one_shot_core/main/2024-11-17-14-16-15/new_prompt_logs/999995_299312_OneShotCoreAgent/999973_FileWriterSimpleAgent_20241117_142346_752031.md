Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in MainGameScene's resolve_turn() method. Currently, when speeds are equal, it always defaults to using the player first. According to the architecture:
> If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

The fix is simple:
1. In resolve_turn(), we'll modify the speed comparison to include a random tiebreaker
2. No changes to models are needed since this is purely scene logic
3. We'll use Python's random.choice() for the 50/50 chance

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Modified resolve_turn() to explicitly handle equal speeds
2. Added random.choice() to determine order when speeds are equal
3. Maintained all other functionality while fixing the speed tie resolution
4. No changes to models were needed since this was purely scene logic

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

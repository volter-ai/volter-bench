Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the MainGameScene test isn't properly handling scene transitions. When we transition to MainMenuScene and it calls quit_whole_game(), the exception isn't being caught in the test.

The solution is to:
- Update the test to handle both possible ways a scene can end:
  1. Scene transition (TransitionFromScene)
  2. Game quit (_QuitWholeGame)
- Use the same pattern as the MainMenuScene test which already handles both cases correctly
- Mock both transition methods to catch either exit condition

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: f014c1cb-cc03-4242-a805-dc6991928a14
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, GracefulExit, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both ways of exiting the scene so we can catch them
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper mocking of both exit methods (_transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game)
2. Added handling of TransitionFromScene exception
3. Added assertions to verify scene exits properly
4. Added proper cleanup in finally block
5. Follows the same pattern as the working MainMenuScene test

This maintains the architecture and properly tests the scene's exit conditions while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine's patterns (visible in test_main_menu_scene.py), we should:
- Patch both exit methods (_quit_whole_game and _transition_to_scene)
- Catch their exceptions to verify the scene exited properly
- Assert that one of them was called

The current test just lets the _QuitWholeGame exception bubble up, causing the test failure.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 2759cb52-3d9d-4173-aa9f-b089f6d32ccc
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both exit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    # important to print how we exited the scene, for debug purposes
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling structure matching the engine's patterns
2. Added patching for both exit methods
3. Added assertions to verify proper scene exit
4. Added cleanup in finally block

This maintains the architecture while properly testing the scene's exit behavior according to the engine's patterns.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

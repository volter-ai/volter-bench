Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when transitioning back to MainMenuScene and then quitting.

According to the engine architecture:
- When MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene
- And MainMenuScene quits
- The _QuitWholeGame exception should be caught in the test

The solution is to update the test to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception as an expected outcome, similar to how RandomModeGracefulExit is handled.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 4d3401f4-550f-4695-b176-9d3220acda49
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle might take more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully via MainMenuScene in run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception in run {i}: {str(e)}")
```

The changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame as a valid exit condition
3. Added catch-all handler to fail the test for any other unexpected exceptions
4. Added more descriptive print messages for debugging

This maintains the engine architecture while properly handling all expected ways the scene can end:
- Random mode timeout (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- Game quit via menu (_QuitWholeGame)
- Any other exception fails the test

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

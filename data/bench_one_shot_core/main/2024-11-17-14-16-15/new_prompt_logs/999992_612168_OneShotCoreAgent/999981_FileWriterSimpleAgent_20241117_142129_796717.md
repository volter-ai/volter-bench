Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (creature HP reaches 0), it just breaks from the loop without calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or end the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The logical flow should be:
1. After battle ends (win or lose)
2. Show the result message
3. Return to MainMenuScene to let the player choose to play again or quit

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end()` method
2. Integrated win/loss checks directly in the main loop
3. Added proper scene transitions back to MainMenuScene after battle ends
4. Removed the break statement that was causing the scene to end improperly

This ensures the scene always ends with a proper transition, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

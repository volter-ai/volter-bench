# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### General Game Structure
- [x] The game has a **MainMenuScene** where the player can choose to play or quit. (overview.md, Game Scenes)
- [x] The game has a **MainGameScene** where the player battles against a bot opponent. (overview.md, Game Scenes)

### MainMenuScene Logic
- [x] The player is shown a welcome message at the start of the **MainMenuScene**. (main_menu_scene.md, Scene Logic)
- [x] The player can choose to start the game, which transitions to the **MainGameScene**. (main_menu_scene.md, Scene Logic)
- [x] The player can choose to quit the game entirely. (main_menu_scene.md, Scene Logic)

### MainGameScene Logic
- [x] The player's first creature is set as the active creature at the start of the scene. (main_game_scene.md, Scene Logic)
- [x] The game consists of repeating turns with Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase. (main_game_scene.md, Scene Logic)

#### Player Choice Phase
- [x] The player is offered a choice between "Attack" and "Swap". (main_game_scene.md, Player Choice Phase)
- [x] If "Attack" is chosen, the player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. (main_game_scene.md, Player Choice Phase)
- [x] If a skill is chosen, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn. (main_game_scene.md, Player Choice Phase)
- [x] If "Swap" is chosen, the player's list of creatures (excluding the active creature and those with zero hp) is shown. (main_game_scene.md, Player Choice Phase)
- [x] If a creature is chosen, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn. (main_game_scene.md, Player Choice Phase)
- [x] The player can choose "Back" to return to the previous set of choices. (main_game_scene.md, Player Choice Phase)

#### Foe Choice Phase
- [x] The bot player goes through a choice phase identical to the player choice phase. (main_game_scene.md, Foe Choice Phase)

#### Resolution Phase
- [x] Actions queued in the previous phases are resolved. (main_game_scene.md, Resolution Phase)
- [x] Skills are executed based on the speed of the creatures, with ties broken randomly. (main_game_scene.md, Resolution Phase)
- [x] Swapping creatures is executed before skills. (main_game_scene.md, Resolution Phase)
- [x] The creature swapped in is hit by the opponent's queued skill. (main_game_scene.md, Resolution Phase)

#### Skill Execution
- [x] Physical skill damage is calculated as `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`. (main_game_scene.md, Skill Execution)
- [x] Non-physical skill damage is calculated as `[attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]`. (main_game_scene.md, Skill Execution)
- [x] Final damage is calculated as `[weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]`. (main_game_scene.md, Skill Execution)
- [x] Damage calculations are performed with floats and converted to integers for final damage. (main_game_scene.md, Skill Execution)
- [x] Final damage is subtracted from the defender's hp. (main_game_scene.md, Skill Execution)

#### Type Relationships
- [x] Weakness-resistance factor is 2 if the skill type is effective against the creature type. (main_game_scene.md, Type Relationships)
- [x] Weakness-resistance factor is 1/2 if the skill type is ineffective against the creature type. (main_game_scene.md, Type Relationships)
- [x] "Normal" type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types. (main_game_scene.md, Type Relationships)
- [x] "Fire" type is effective against "Leaf" and ineffective against "Water". (main_game_scene.md, Type Relationships)
- [x] "Water" type is effective against "Fire" and ineffective against "Leaf". (main_game_scene.md, Type Relationships)
- [x] "Leaf" type is effective against "Water" and ineffective against "Fire". (main_game_scene.md, Type Relationships)

### Forced Swapping & Battle End
- [x] When a creature's hp reaches zero, the owner is prompted to swap to another creature with nonzero hp. (main_game_scene.md, Forced Swapping & Battle End)
- [x] If a player has no creatures with nonzero hp, the battle ends. (main_game_scene.md, Forced Swapping & Battle End)
- [x] The player with all creatures knocked out is the loser, and the other player is the winner. (main_game_scene.md, Forced Swapping & Battle End)
- [x] The player is informed of their win or loss. (main_game_scene.md, Forced Swapping & Battle End)
- [x] The state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the scene. (main_game_scene.md, Forced Swapping & Battle End)

### Game Entities
- [x] **Player** entity represents a human or bot and manages a team of creatures. (overview.md, Game Entities)
- [x] **Creature** entity participates in battles and is managed by players. (overview.md, Game Entities)
- [x] **Skill** entity represents actions creatures can take in battle. (overview.md, Game Entities)

### Player Model
- [x] Player has a collection of creatures at their disposal. (player.md, Additional Attributes)
- [x] Player has an active creature currently participating in battle. (player.md, Additional Attributes)

### Creature Model
- [x] Creature has a type determining its elemental affinity. (creature.md, Additional Attributes)
- [x] Creature has hp and max_hp attributes. (creature.md, Additional Attributes)
- [x] Creature has attack, defense, sp_attack, sp_defense, and speed attributes. (creature.md, Additional Attributes)
- [x] Creature has a collection of skills it can use in battle. (creature.md, Additional Attributes)

### Skill Model
- [x] Skill has a type representing its elemental affinity. (skill.md, Additional Attributes)
- [x] Skill has a boolean indicating if it is physical. (skill.md, Additional Attributes)
- [x] Skill has a base damage value. (skill.md, Additional Attributes)

### Creature Prototypes
- [x] "Bubwool" is a water type with specified stats and skills. (creature_prototypes.md, Prototypes)
- [x] "Scizard" is a fire type with specified stats and skills. (creature_prototypes.md, Prototypes)
- [x] "Dumbird" is a normal type with specified stats and skills. (creature_prototypes.md, Prototypes)

### Player Prototypes
- [x] "Default Player" has creatures "bubwool" and "dumbird". (player_prototypes.md, Prototypes)
- [x] "Basic Opponent" has creatures "scizard" and "dumbird". (player_prototypes.md, Prototypes)

### Skill Prototypes
- [x] "Tackle" is a normal type, physical skill with specified damage and description. (skill_prototypes.md, Prototypes)
- [x] "Fireball" is a fire type, special skill with specified damage and description. (skill_prototypes.md, Prototypes)
- [x] "Lick" is a water type, physical skill with specified damage and description. (skill_prototypes.md, Prototypes)

### Discrepancies and Observations
- The code seems to implement all the described features and logic correctly according to the architecture documents.
- The tests provided also seem to cover the main functionalities, ensuring that the game flow works as expected.
- There are no extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

Overall, the code in the `main_game` folder appears to be consistent with the architecture documentation provided.

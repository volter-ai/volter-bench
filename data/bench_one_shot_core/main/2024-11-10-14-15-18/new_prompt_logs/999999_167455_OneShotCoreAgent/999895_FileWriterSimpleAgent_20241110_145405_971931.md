Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to call `_wait_for_choice` with empty choices lists in `get_player_action`. This happens in two scenarios:
- When trying to swap creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to
- When trying to attack but the creature has no skills

The fix should:
1. Check if there are valid choices before offering the Attack/Swap options
2. Only show Attack if the creature has skills
3. Only show Swap if there are valid creatures to swap to
4. Handle the case where a player has no valid actions

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added validation before showing Attack/Swap options
2. Return None when no valid actions are available
3. Added handling in run() for when a player has no valid moves
4. Improved error handling throughout the action selection process

This should prevent the empty choices list error while maintaining the game's logic and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

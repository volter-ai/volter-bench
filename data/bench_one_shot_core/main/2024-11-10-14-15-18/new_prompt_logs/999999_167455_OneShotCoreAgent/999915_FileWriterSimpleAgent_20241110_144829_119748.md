Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game.

According to the error message and engine architecture, we need to either:
- Call `_transition_to_scene()` to go back to the main menu
- Call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game

Since this is a game where players might want to play multiple battles, it makes more sense to return to the main menu after a battle ends. We should modify the MainGameScene to transition back to MainMenuScene when the battle concludes.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed the run() method to properly transition back to MainMenuScene when the battle ends instead of just returning
2. Added a message to inform the player they're returning to the main menu
3. Fixed the return values in _get_player_action to continue the loop instead of returning None

This should resolve the issue while maintaining the proper architecture and scene transition flow required by the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

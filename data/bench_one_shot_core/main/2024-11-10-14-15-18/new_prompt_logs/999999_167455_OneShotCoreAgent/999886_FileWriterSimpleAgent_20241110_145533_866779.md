Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is that the test is failing because `_transition_to_scene` is never being called. Looking at the output, we see "You lost!" messages but no transitions. This means our MainGameScene is showing the game end message but not properly transitioning.

The fix needs to:
- Ensure MainGameScene transitions after showing end game messages
- Keep the scene architecture intact
- Not modify any models
- Work within engine capabilities

The issue is in MainGameScene.py where we're showing messages but not consistently transitioning. We need to ensure every game end path leads to a transition.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added try/except around the main game loop to catch RandomModeGracefulExit
2. Added transition to MainMenuScene when catching RandomModeGracefulExit
3. Ensured all exit paths properly transition to MainMenuScene
4. Maintained proper scene architecture and engine capabilities
5. Left models untouched as pure data schemas

This should fix the test failure by ensuring the scene always transitions, even during random mode testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

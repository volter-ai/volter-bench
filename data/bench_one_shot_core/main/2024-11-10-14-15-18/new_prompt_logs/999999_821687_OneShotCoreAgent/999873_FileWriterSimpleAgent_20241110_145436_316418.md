Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue points out two missing features from the architecture:

a) Back Button in Player Choice Phase:
- Need to add "Back" option when showing skills or swap choices
- Will use Button class for the back option
- Need to modify get_attack_choice and get_swap_choice to handle back button
- Will implement recursive choice structure in get_player_action

b) Random Speed Tie Resolution:
- Need to add random choice when speeds are equal
- Will use random.choice to select which player goes first
- Will modify resolve_turn to handle this case

The fix requires modifying only MainGameScene.py since these are gameplay logic changes, not model changes.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both attack and swap choice menus
2. Modified get_player_action to handle back button recursively
3. Added random speed tie resolution using random.sample
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas
5. Maintained scene responsibility for game logic
6. Used engine's Button and SelectThing classes for choices

The implementation now fully matches the architecture document while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to get choices for swapping creatures. The assertion fails because we're getting an empty list of choices. This happens because:
- We filter available creatures with `c.hp > 0 and c != player.active_creature`
- When all creatures except the active one are fainted, this results in an empty list
- We should allow swapping even if only the active creature is alive (to handle the case where the active creature is about to faint)

The solution:
- Only filter out creatures with 0 HP when getting swap choices
- Keep the active creature in the swap list since it's valid to "swap to self" (effectively skipping the turn)
- This maintains game balance while fixing the error
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `c != player.active_creature` filter when getting available creatures for swapping
2. Added a check in execute_action to only perform swaps if the target is different from the current active creature
3. Maintained all the existing game mechanics while fixing the empty choices issue

This solution stays within the engine's capabilities and maintains the separation between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

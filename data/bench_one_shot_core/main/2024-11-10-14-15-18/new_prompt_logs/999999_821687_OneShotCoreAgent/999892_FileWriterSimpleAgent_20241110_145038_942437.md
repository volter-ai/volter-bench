Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Description:
The issue is that the "Back" option is missing from the attack/swap submenus. To fix this:
- We'll add a Button for "Back" in both the skills and creature selection menus
- When "Back" is selected, we'll return None from get_player_choice()
- In the main loop, if None is returned, we'll ask for the choice again
- This maintains pure data models and uses the engine's existing Button class
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skills and creature selection menus
2. Modified get_player_choice to return None when Back is selected
3. Added while loop in run() to keep asking for choices until a valid action is selected
4. Maintained all existing game mechanics while adding the Back functionality
5. No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

This solution:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Maintains separation between models and game logic
- Implements the missing Back functionality as required
- Uses existing engine components (Button class)
- Maintains proper game flow and battle mechanics

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. The test is failing because it's not catching the expected GracefulExit exception when the game quits. Looking at the engine code:
- The engine expects GracefulExit exceptions to be caught when testing scenes
- The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
- No changes needed to models or game logic, just test handling

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 3f6f909e-6823-463e-8ddb-32fc2f096321
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully during run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

Key changes:
1. Added proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added better error reporting for unexpected exceptions
3. Maintained test coverage while properly handling expected game exit conditions
4. No changes needed to models or game logic since this was purely a test issue

This solution:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Maintains separation between models and game logic
- Properly handles both types of expected graceful exits
- Provides better debugging information if unexpected errors occur

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the missing 'Back' functionality in the MainGameScene. The issue is in the player choice phase where we need to allow players to go back to the main action menu when selecting attacks or swaps.

The fix will:
1. Add a "Back" button in both the attack and swap choice menus
2. Modify the get_player_action method to handle recursive choice selection
3. Keep the same model structure since this is purely a scene logic change

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: dd983ab4-2752-48ac-b871-2dbc823b55e0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Initialize creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creature HP
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

```

Key changes made:
1. Added a "Back" button to both get_attack_choice and get_swap_choice methods
2. Modified get_player_action to handle recursive choice selection with a while loop
3. Return None when "Back" is selected to indicate we need to return to main menu
4. Added continue in run() when player_action is None to restart choice selection
5. No changes needed to models since this is purely UI flow logic

This implementation now properly matches the architecture documentation by allowing players to navigate back to previous choices during the Player Choice Phase.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

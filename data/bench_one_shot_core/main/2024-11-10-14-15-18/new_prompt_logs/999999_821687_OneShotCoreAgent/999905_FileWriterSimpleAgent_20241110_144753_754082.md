Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that SelectThing doesn't have a 'player' attribute, but we're trying to use it to track which player made the action. We need to track actions with both the choice and the player who made it.

Instead of trying to use SelectThing directly, we should create a proper Action model that inherits from AbstractThing to represent game actions. This follows the architecture pattern of using models for game data. The Action model will store:
- The player who made the action
- The thing being used (skill or creature)

This maintains the pure data model approach while giving us the structure we need to track actions properly.

2. Here's the implementation:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added Action model to properly track player actions
2. Modified MainGameScene to create and use Action objects
3. Refactored code to use the new Action model for cleaner action handling
4. Added proper type hints throughout
5. Maintained pure data models approach

This solution stays within the engine's capabilities while fixing the attribute error by properly modeling game actions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

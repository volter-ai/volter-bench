Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When the battle ends and transitions to MainMenuScene, the menu scene calls `_quit_whole_game()` which raises a QuitWholeGame exception. This is expected behavior, but we need to catch it in our test.

The fix should:
- Keep all models as pure data schemas
- Not modify the engine's behavior
- Properly catch the expected QuitWholeGame exception in the test
- Allow the test to verify the scene ran successfully before quitting

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5deca079-293c-4c84-bfb6-fc0e7bb87174
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                # Both exceptions are expected - either from random mode completing or game quitting
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
                continue
            except Exception as e:
                # Any other exception is a real error
                raise e
```

Key changes:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the caught exceptions
2. Kept the same test structure but properly handles both expected exceptions
3. Still raises unexpected exceptions
4. Maintains test coverage of the battle scene
5. Doesn't modify any game logic or models

This fix follows the engine's architecture by:
- Not modifying any models
- Keeping scenes responsible for game logic
- Working with the engine's expected exception handling
- Maintaining proper scene transitions
- Allowing proper testing of random gameplay

The test will now pass while still verifying that the battle scene works correctly through multiple random playthroughs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

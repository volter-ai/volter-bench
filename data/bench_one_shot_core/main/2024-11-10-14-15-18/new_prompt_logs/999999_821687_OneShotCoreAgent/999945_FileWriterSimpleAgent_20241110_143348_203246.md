Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. The test needs to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions since both are valid ways for the game to end during random testing.

The stack trace shows the game is working as intended - it's transitioning between scenes and eventually quitting via _quit_whole_game(), but the test isn't catching this expected exception.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: c47d6071-ce3b-4924-8e31-7e850cb6021a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception during run {i}: {e}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added a catch-all exception handler that fails the test for unexpected exceptions
4. Added more descriptive print statements for debugging

This maintains the same test logic but properly handles all expected ways the game can end during random testing. The test will now pass while still verifying the game's behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because scene transitions are creating an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, and when _quit_whole_game() is eventually called, the exception isn't being caught properly in the test.

The test needs to handle both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions, since either could occur during random testing. We also need to patch the transitions in MainGameScene just like we do in MainMenuScene to prevent the infinite loop.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 97132160-be44-4d5c-9aec-c1c86b2f0673
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene did not exit properly"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:

1. Added patching of _transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game for MainGameScene just like we do for MainMenuScene
2. Added handling of AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
3. Added TransitionFromScene exception to catch and verify scene transitions
4. Added proper assertions to verify the scene exited correctly

This maintains the architecture while properly testing the scene transitions and game flow. The test will now properly handle all possible ways the scene could end during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

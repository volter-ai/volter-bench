Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in our test. The error stack trace shows we're getting into an infinite loop of transitions between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, which eventually ends with a _QuitWholeGame exception that isn't caught.

In the test, we need to:
1. Catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
2. Mock both _transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game methods
3. Follow the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 288a1d7a-ec52-4050-bc28-4fbd56c2af65
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
2. Added proper mocking of both transition and quit methods
3. Followed the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py for consistency

This should now properly test the MainGameScene without getting into infinite transition loops, while still verifying that the scene properly ends either through transition or quitting.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the FixableException that occurs when attempting to transition back without a scene history. This is happening because we're trying to use `_transition_back` in the MainGameScene, but it's the first scene in the stack.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. Instead of using `_transition_back`, we'll use `_transition_to_scene` to go back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll modify the MainGameScene to use the correct transition method.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 30445666-369f-461b-a123-abc0aa39ab57
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
        
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = self.player, self.opponent
            first_creature, second_creature = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, opponent_skill
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = self.opponent, self.player
            first_creature, second_creature = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
            first_skill, second_skill = opponent_skill, player_skill
        else:
            # Random decision for equal speed
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = self.player, self.opponent
                first_creature, second_creature = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, opponent_skill
            else:
                first, second = self.opponent, self.player
                first_creature, second_creature = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = opponent_skill, player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This change replaces the `_transition_back` call with `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the `game_loop` method. This should resolve the FixableException by ensuring we're not trying to transition back without a scene history.

The rest of the file remains the same, maintaining the existing game logic and structure. This solution adheres to the engine's capabilities and the game's architecture while fixing the specific issue raised in the QA/testing phase.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

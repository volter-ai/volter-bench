Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random tie-breaking logic for speed in the resolution phase.
2. Add forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.

These changes will be made within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models, as they are meant to be pure data schemas.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. Random tie-breaking for speed: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've added `random.random()` to the sorting key. This ensures that when two creatures have the same speed, their order will be randomized.

2. Forced swapping when a creature is knocked out: We've added a new `_force_swap` method and a check after each action in the `_resolution_phase`. If a creature's HP reaches 0, the opponent is forced to swap to another creature with remaining HP.

These modifications align the implementation more closely with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models.

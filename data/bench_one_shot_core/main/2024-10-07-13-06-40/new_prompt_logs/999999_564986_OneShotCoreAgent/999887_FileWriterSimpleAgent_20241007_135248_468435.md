Content: To address the issue of not implementing random order resolution when creatures have the same speed, I'll modify the MainGameScene class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll fix it:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, I'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. I'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as it's purely a logic change within the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

This implementation now includes random order resolution when creatures have the same speed, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. The `_resolution_phase` method now has a separate case for equal speeds, where it randomly chooses which creature goes first using `random.choice`. This ensures that when creatures have the same speed, the order of skill execution is randomized, as specified in the architecture documentation.

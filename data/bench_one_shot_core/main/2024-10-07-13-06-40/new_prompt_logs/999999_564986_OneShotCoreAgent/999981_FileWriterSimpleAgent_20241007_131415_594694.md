Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop to properly handle the end of the battle and trigger the transition.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 49f7a9f5-1a31-4263-9ac9-a5f54f6c5a82
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "It's your turn!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._apply_damage(self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_damage(self, attacker, skill, target):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to use the `battle_ended` flag and transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
3. Updating the `_resolve_turn` method to check for battle end after each creature's turn, preventing unnecessary actions if the battle has already ended.
4. Ensuring that the scene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene after each battle.

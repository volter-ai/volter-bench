Content: I understand the issue. The current implementation doesn't include random tie-breaking for creatures with equal speed, as specified in the architecture documentation. Here's how I'll fix this issue:

1. Description of the fix:
   We need to modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of using a simple comparison for speed, we'll implement a tie-breaking mechanism when the speeds are equal. We'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first in case of a tie.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to include this fix. The changes will be in the `_resolution_phase` method.

```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. Added a new method `_determine_first_attacker` that implements the random tie-breaking for equal speeds.
2. Modified the `_resolution_phase` method to use the new `_determine_first_attacker` method instead of directly comparing speeds.

These changes ensure that when the player's creature and the opponent's creature have equal speed, the order of attack is randomly determined, as specified in the architecture documentation. This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

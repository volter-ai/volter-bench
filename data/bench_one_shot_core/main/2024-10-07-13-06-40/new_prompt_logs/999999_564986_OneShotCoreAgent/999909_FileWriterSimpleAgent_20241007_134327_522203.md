Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until a transition or quit occurs.
3. We'll ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game, depending on the player's choice.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop continues until the battle ends.
2. Adding an `_end_battle` method that gives the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to return to the MainMenuScene if the player chooses to play again.
4. Using `_quit_whole_game` if the player chooses to quit.

This implementation should resolve the test failures by properly exiting the MainGameScene and either transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game entirely. The scene will no longer terminate without calling the appropriate exit methods, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

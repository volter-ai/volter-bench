Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends (either when a player wins or loses).

2. We'll update the execute_skill method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle should continue or not.

3. We'll modify the run method to properly handle the end of the battle and transition to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 6cce786d-8296-4144-abda-350c55ec5af6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.player_choice_phase() and self.foe_choice_phase():
                if not self.resolution_phase():
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    break
            else:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill = choice.thing
        return True

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.opponent_skill = choice.thing
        return True

    def resolution_phase(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = self.player, self.opponent
            first_skill, second_skill = self.player_skill, self.opponent_skill
        else:
            first, second = self.opponent, self.player
            first_skill, second_skill = self.opponent_skill, self.player_skill

        if not self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):
            return False
        if not self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill):
            return False
        return True

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        attacker_creature = attacker.creatures[0]
        defender_creature = defender.creatures[0]

        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

        if defender_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} fainted!")
            if defender == self.player:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return False
        return True

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. This should resolve both issues:

1. The scene now properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends.
2. The test should now pass because the scene will exit as expected.

The modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. We're using the `_transition_to_scene` method to properly exit the scene, which should resolve the FixableException in the test_whole_game.py test as well.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' in the App class initialization. The error occurs because we're trying to use MainMenuScene before it's imported. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `main.py` file to import the necessary scene classes at the top of the file.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary imports are present and correctly ordered to avoid circular import issues.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: cff9c1d2-c0da-437a-9532-328c608e1483
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This change should resolve the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' while maintaining the required structure and adhering to the engine's capabilities. We've added the necessary imports at the top of the file, ensuring that all required classes are available when initializing the App class.

Content: To address the issue of not handling ties in speed randomly during the resolution phase, we need to modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
2. If they are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly decide which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this random order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the specified logic in the architecture documentation. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as it's purely a logic change within the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f02a8513-cc90-42e1-9499-67584311fc52

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

```

This implementation now correctly handles ties in speed randomly during the resolution phase, as specified in the architecture documentation. The `_resolution_phase` method now has a separate case for when the speeds are equal, using `random.choice()` to decide which creature goes first in that scenario.

Content: I understand the issue now. The error occurs because we're passing a Player object instead of a Creature object to the _calculate_damage method. This is likely due to a mistake in how we're handling the attacker and defender in the _execute_skill method. Let's fix this issue by updating the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we'll pass the actual Creature objects instead of Player objects to _execute_skill.
2. We'll update the _execute_skill method to receive Creature objects directly.
3. We'll ensure that the _calculate_damage method receives the correct Creature objects.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError we were seeing. The main fixes are:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we now pass the Creature objects (first[1] and second[1]) instead of Player objects to _execute_skill.
2. The _execute_skill method now receives Creature objects directly instead of Player objects.
3. The _calculate_damage method now correctly works with Creature objects for both attacker and defender.

These modifications ensure that we're working with Creature objects throughout the battle logic, which should resolve the 'Player' object has no attribute 'defense' error. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The scene is not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of its execution, which is causing the FixableException.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 5d72179f-f44f-4076-b7ab-abd72448b6b6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

                    self.handle_battle_end()

        else:
            first, second = self.opponent, self.player
            first_skill, second_skill = self.opponent_skill, self.player_skill

        if not self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This modified version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. In `handle_battle_end`, we give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game using `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` respectively.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve both the AssertionError in the test_main_game_scene_random_run and the FixableException in the test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' in the App class. The error occurs because we haven't imported the necessary scene classes in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `main.py` file to import the required scene classes.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary imports are present at the top of the file.
3. We'll keep the App class implementation as is, but with the proper imports in place.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 72500654-1802-430c-bd91-1710ef954d6a
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution addresses the NameError by importing the necessary scene classes (MainMenuScene and MainGameScene) at the beginning of the file. The rest of the App class implementation remains the same, as it was already correct.

By adding these imports, we ensure that the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes are available when the App class is initialized, which should resolve the NameError we were encountering in the tests.

This change stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. The models remain pure data schemas, and the scene logic is kept separate in their respective files.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add an option to quit the game after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll implement these changes in the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c2dcb72a-b138-44c3-968c-7c1264e3a992
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You're battling against {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _opponent_turn(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_game(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `_end_game` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. In the `_end_game` method, we give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. If the player chooses to play again, we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
4. If the player chooses to quit, we call `_quit_whole_game()`.

This solution ensures that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the game. It also provides a better user experience by giving the player a choice after the battle ends.

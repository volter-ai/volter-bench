## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes in the `MainGameScene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll add a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll remove the `turn_queue` attribute from the `MainGameScene` class and instead use a local variable within the `run` method.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and removes the unserializable attribute warnings.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: a9c34abb-a64d-42cd-a414-9909aa2f6e29
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp})

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene exits properly.
2. Removing the `turn_queue` as a class attribute and instead using it as a local variable within the `run` method, which eliminates the unserializable attribute warnings.

The rest of the game logic remains the same, maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need any changes as it already follows the guidelines of being pure data schemas inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and warnings while keeping the game functionality intact.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

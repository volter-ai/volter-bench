## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` at the end of the game.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `game_loop` method to break out of the loop when the battle ends.
2. After the game loop, we'll add logic to transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns a boolean value.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 422ba19f-ff93-4819-b699-8ae1e033de8e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def game_loop(self):
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `game_loop` method to use a `battle_ended` flag, which is set by the `check_battle_end` method.
2. Ensuring that the `check_battle_end` method returns a boolean value.
3. Adding a `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` call after the `game_loop` in the `run` method, which will transition back to the main menu when the battle is over.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene properly exits or transitions at the end of the game. The scene will now always transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle, allowing the game to continue or end properly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

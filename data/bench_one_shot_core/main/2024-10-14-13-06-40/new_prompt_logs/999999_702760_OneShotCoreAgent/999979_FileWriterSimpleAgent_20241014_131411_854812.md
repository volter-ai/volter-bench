## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem by implementing the reset functionality for the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`.
2. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and respects the architecture. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: bf247d4a-5766-4a8f-b8f1-4961d743c134
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation adds the `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their maximum HP. The method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene. This fix addresses the issue raised during QA/testing while maintaining the integrity of the game's architecture and model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the resolution phase in the MainGameScene where creatures with equal speed should have their order resolved randomly.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal, and if so, use random.choice to determine which creature goes first. This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a6b77a24-bf67-482c-9c1b-f7ba5488ec1c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.reset_creatures()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            ])
            second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, second_defender = (
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
                if first_attacker == self.player else
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            )

            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender)
            if second_defender.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, second_defender)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have equal speed by randomly determining which creature goes first in the resolution phase. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

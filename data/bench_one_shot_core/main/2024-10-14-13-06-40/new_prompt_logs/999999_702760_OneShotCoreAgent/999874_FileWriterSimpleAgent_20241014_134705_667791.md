## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement random order when creatures have the same speed during skill execution.
2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the `MainGameScene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
2. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the state of all creatures, and call it before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

These changes will ensure that the game follows the architecture documentation more closely while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a random factor to the sorting key in the `resolution_phase` method, ensuring random order when creatures have the same speed:
# Excerpt ID: 66a50a46-90d1-4ae9-80a8-4e67f739c6f4
   ```python
   turn_queue.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] != "swap", -x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random()))
   ```

2. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to reset the state of all creatures, and calling it before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`:
# Excerpt ID: e114cdab-7cfd-4d17-9e80-70735246aa13
   ```python
   def reset_creatures(self):
       for player in [self.player, self.opponent]:
           for creature in player.creatures:
               creature.hp = creature.max_hp
       self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
   ```

   This method is called at the end of the `run` method:
# Excerpt ID: 26df1bac-129b-4542-89b5-a8afc3c16628
   ```python
   self.reset_creatures()
   self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
   ```

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need any changes as it already follows the guidelines of being pure data schemas inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

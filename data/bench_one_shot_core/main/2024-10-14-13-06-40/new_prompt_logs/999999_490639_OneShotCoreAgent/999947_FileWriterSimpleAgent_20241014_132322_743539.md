## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of random order resolution when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll implement the solution:

   - We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - We'll then execute the skills in the order determined by either the speed comparison or the random selection.

This solution adheres to the architecture requirements and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as we're only modifying the game logic within the scene.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9db319eb-7cfa-4a4c-9bb9-b74da1bf28c1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        battle_result = self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result(battle_result)
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            battle_result = self.check_battle_end()
            if battle_result:
                return battle_result

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                self.player, player_skill, self.opponent, foe_skill
            )
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                self.opponent, foe_skill, self.player, player_skill
            )
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                    self.player, player_skill, self.opponent, foe_skill
                )
            else:
                first_attacker, first_skill, second_attacker, second_skill = (
                    self.opponent, foe_skill, self.player, player_skill
                )

        self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_attacker.creatures[0], first_skill, second_attacker.creatures[0])
        if second_attacker.creatures[0].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_attacker.creatures[0], second_skill, first_attacker.creatures[0])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            return "lose"
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return "win"
        return None

    def display_battle_result(self, result):
        if result == "win":
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        elif result == "lose":
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining the order of skill execution. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, and we've maintained the structure of the scene as required by the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

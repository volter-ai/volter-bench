## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem with the resolution phase where the order of skill execution is not randomized when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the fix:

   - Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly determine which creature goes first.
   - Implement the skill execution based on this randomized order.

This solution adheres to the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as the randomization is handled within the scene logic.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: fd70be2f-0f7a-4872-b110-358942a2d010
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by randomizing the order of skill execution when the creatures have the same speed. The `resolution_phase` method now includes a separate case for equal speeds, using `random.choice()` to determine which creature attacks first. This ensures that the battle mechanics align with the requirements specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll update the run method to break the loop and transition when the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f755d5b3-71ba-4e09-8574-9422870c5ebc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

                return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):

    def end_battle(self):

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
        
        # Ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Modifying the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean instead of handling the end-game logic.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that displays the battle result and asks the player if they want to play again or quit.
3. Updating the `run` method to break the loop when the battle ends and call the `end_battle` method.
4. In the `end_battle` method, we give the player a choice to play again (transition to MainMenuScene) or quit the game.

These changes ensure that the scene properly exits and transitions to another scene or quits the game when the battle ends, resolving the issues raised in the QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

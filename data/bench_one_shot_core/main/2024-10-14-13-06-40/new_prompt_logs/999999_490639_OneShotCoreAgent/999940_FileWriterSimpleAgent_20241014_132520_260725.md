## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene and transition to a new scene or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll update the run method to break the loop and transition to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: eab4e35b-87dd-4d7b-b844-e48fa685fc6b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

> Use Skill
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.player_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            if self.opponent_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
        self.end_battle()

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn! Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def opponent_turn(self):
        opponent_skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        return self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")
        return defender.hp == 0

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Modifying the `run` method to break the loop when `check_battle_end` returns True.
3. Calling `end_battle` after the battle loop ends, ensuring that the scene always transitions or quits properly.

These changes should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the scene not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle ends. The MainGameScene will now always transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over, following the proper flow of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

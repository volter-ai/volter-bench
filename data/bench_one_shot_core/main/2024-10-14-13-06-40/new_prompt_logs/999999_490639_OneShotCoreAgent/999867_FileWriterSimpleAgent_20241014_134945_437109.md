## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of lacking forced swapping when a creature is knocked out, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a new method `_check_and_force_swap` that will be called after each attack.
2. This method will check if the active creature of either player has been knocked out (HP <= 0).
3. If a creature is knocked out, we'll force the player to swap to another creature with HP > 0.
4. If the player has no more creatures with HP > 0, we'll end the battle.
5. We'll integrate this new method into the `_resolve_turn` method.

Here's the proposed solution:

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding the `_check_and_force_swap` method, which is called after each attack in the `_resolve_turn` method. When a creature is knocked out, the player is forced to swap to another creature with HP > 0. If no such creature is available, the battle ends.

The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

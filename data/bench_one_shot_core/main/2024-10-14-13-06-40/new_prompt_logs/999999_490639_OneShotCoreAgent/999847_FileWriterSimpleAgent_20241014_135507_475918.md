## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Add explicit handling for forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.
3. Implement a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the Main Game Scene.

These changes will be implemented while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main choice menu.
2. Forced swapping on knockout is explicitly handled in the `resolve_turn` method, which calls `check_knockout` and `force_swap` after each action.
3. The state of the player's creatures is reset in the `reset_creatures_state` method, which is called when the battle ends and in the `__del__` method to ensure it happens when leaving the scene.

These changes maintain the separation of concerns between models and game logic, and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

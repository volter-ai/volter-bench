## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the AttributeError occurring when trying to access the `display_name` of the opponent's `active_creature`, which is `None`. This suggests that the `active_creature` for the opponent is not being properly initialized before the `__str__` method of the MainGameScene is called.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to ensure that both the player and opponent have their `active_creature` set before any other operations are performed.
2. We'll move the initialization of `active_creature` to the constructor of the `MainGameScene` class.
3. We'll add a safety check in the `__str__` method to handle cases where `active_creature` might be `None`.

This approach adheres to the guidelines of keeping models as pure data schemas and maintaining the game logic within the scenes. It also stays within the capabilities of the engine.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the AttributeError by:

1. Initializing the `active_creature` for both player and opponent in the constructor.
2. Adding safety checks in the `__str__` method to handle cases where `active_creature` might be `None`.
3. Adding additional checks throughout the class to handle potential `None` values for `active_creature`.

This solution maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas and implementing the game logic within the scene class. It also stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the guidelines for model inheritance.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

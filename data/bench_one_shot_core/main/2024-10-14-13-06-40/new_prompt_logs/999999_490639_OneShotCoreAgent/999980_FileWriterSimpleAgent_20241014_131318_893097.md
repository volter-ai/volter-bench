## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll describe how to fix the problem and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the issue of resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

The fix will involve the following steps:
a. Add a `reset_creatures` method to the MainGameScene class.
b. Call this method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene in the `check_battle_end` method.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and respects the architecture. We won't modify the models, as they should remain pure data schemas.

2. Updated MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 2f8bff36-ec17-43e9-8aaa-ae1e159d16b8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation adds the `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent. The method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `check_battle_end` method. This ensures that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the MainGameScene, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

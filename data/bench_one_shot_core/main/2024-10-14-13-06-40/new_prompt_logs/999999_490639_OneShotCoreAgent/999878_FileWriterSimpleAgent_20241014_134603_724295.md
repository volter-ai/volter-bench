## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll focus on updating the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix each issue:

1. Add the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Ensure the bot's choice phase explicitly mimics the player's choice phase.
3. Implement random resolution for speed ties during skill execution.

Here's the detailed plan:

1. Modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to include a 'Back' option when choosing skills or creatures to swap.
2. Create a separate `_bot_choice_phase` method that mirrors the `_player_choice_phase` but uses the bot's listener for choices.
3. Update the `_resolution_phase` method to randomly resolve speed ties.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now included in both the attack and swap choices for players and bots.
2. A separate `_bot_choice_phase` method has been created that explicitly mimics the player's choice phase, ensuring that the bot's decision-making process is identical to the player's.
3. Speed ties are now resolved randomly by adding a random factor to the sorting key in the `_resolution_phase` method.

These modifications should bring the implementation in line with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the battle ends. This is similar to how we handle it in test_main_menu_scene.py where we catch both TransitionFromScene and RandomModeGracefulExit.

We need to:
1. Add _QuitWholeGame to the exceptions we catch in the test
2. Add a print statement to show how the scene ended
3. Keep all the architectural requirements intact

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 0c91a31a-3720-4e07-8fec-2225521d9024
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"exiting via random mode counter")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"exiting via game completion")
```

This fix:
1. Maintains all architectural requirements (models remain pure data schemas, scenes handle logic)
2. Properly handles the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs when the battle ends
3. Provides clear logging of how the test run ended
4. Keeps the random testing functionality intact

The test will now pass because it properly handles all possible ways the scene can end - either through the random mode counter expiring or through a natural battle conclusion.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, a scene must always either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to let the player play again
2. Or quit the whole game if they lose

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a28d96e0-8566-4304-b54c-baf8b8de7ff0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Game over on loss
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to menu on win

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order based on speed
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            second = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            second = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
                second = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            else:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
                second = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

        # Execute attacks
        for attacker, defender, skill in [first, second]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender is still conscious
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end()` method and integrated the logic directly in the main loop
2. Added proper scene transitions:
   - On player victory: Return to main menu with `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`
   - On player defeat: End the game with `_quit_whole_game()`
3. Removed the break statement that was causing the scene to end improperly

This ensures the scene always ends with either a transition or game quit, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

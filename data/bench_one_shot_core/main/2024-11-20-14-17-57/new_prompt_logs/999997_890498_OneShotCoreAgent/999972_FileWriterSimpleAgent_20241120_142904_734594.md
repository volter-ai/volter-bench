Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because main.py is trying to import MainGameScene but the file doesn't exist yet. The solution is to:

1. Remove the MainGameScene import from main.py until we implement it
2. Only register MainMenuScene initially
3. We can add MainGameScene registration later when we implement it

This follows the principle of implementing one scene at a time and testing it thoroughly before moving on.

2. Here's the fixed main.py:

# Excerpt ID: 541252f4-0228-45e1-a2a7-9c6b6fcbde6a
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

This change allows us to test MainMenuScene in isolation first. Once that's working, we can implement MainGameScene and add its registration to App. This is a better incremental development approach that follows the engine's capabilities and testing framework.

Would you like me to proceed with implementing MainGameScene next?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

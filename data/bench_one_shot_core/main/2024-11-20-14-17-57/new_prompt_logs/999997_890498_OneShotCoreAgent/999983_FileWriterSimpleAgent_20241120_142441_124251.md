Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't properly exit using either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without transitioning anywhere.

The fix is simple: after a battle ends, we should either:
1. Return to the main menu, or
2. Quit the whole game

Since this is a simple game, let's have it return to the main menu after each battle. This maintains the game loop and lets players play multiple battles if they want.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: e644e519-b1f4-470a-847d-714ad90854e2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Return to main menu after battle ends
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        factor = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": factor = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": factor = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": factor = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": factor = 0.5
            
        return int(raw_damage * factor)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill
        
        # If speeds are equal, randomize
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first
                first_skill, second_skill = second_skill, first_skill

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, first_skill), (second, first, second_skill)]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, skill, defender)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends instead of just breaking the loop. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must always exit via either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

This change maintains the architecture and capabilities of the engine while fixing the test failures. The scene properly signals its completion by transitioning back to the menu, which is a more complete game flow than just ending abruptly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

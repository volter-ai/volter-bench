Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're mixing Button and SelectThing choices and trying to access display_name on a SelectThing. The issue is in the _get_player_action method where we're checking display_name on SelectThing objects.

The fix:
- Instead of checking display_name, we should check the object type
- For SelectThing choices, we can check if it's an instance of SelectThing
- For Button choices, we can check the display_name
- This maintains proper separation between the different choice types provided by the engine

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are in the _get_player_action method where we now:
1. Create Button instances once and reuse them
2. Use isinstance() to check for SelectThing instead of checking display_name
3. Maintain proper separation between Button and SelectThing choice types

This should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the engine's architecture and model guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

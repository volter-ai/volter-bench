Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that the test is failing because it can't find `main_game.scenes.main_game_scene`. This is because we referenced MainGameScene in main.py but haven't created the file yet. We need to implement the MainGameScene with the battle logic.

The scene needs to:
- Handle turn-based combat between player and bot
- Manage creature swapping
- Calculate damage based on types and stats
- Track creature HP and handle knockouts

2. Here's the implementation of main_game_scene.py:

This implementation:
1. Follows the scene architecture by inheriting from AbstractGameScene
2. Uses the engine's choice system with Button and SelectThing
3. Implements all battle mechanics from the spec
4. Properly handles state through the models
5. Uses _show_text for game feedback
6. Transitions back to menu when done
7. Resets creature state before leaving

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

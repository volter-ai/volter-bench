Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly signaling game completion to the engine. When a battle ends, we need to call `_quit_whole_game()` since this is a simple game where the battle is the final scene. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the `run` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. This properly signals to the engine that the game is complete rather than just breaking the loop. This maintains the architecture while fixing the scene termination issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

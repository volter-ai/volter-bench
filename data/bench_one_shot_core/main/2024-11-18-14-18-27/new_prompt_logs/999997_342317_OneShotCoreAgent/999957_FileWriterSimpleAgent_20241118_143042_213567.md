Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not catching the GracefulExit exception in the test. The engine expects these exceptions to be caught when testing scenes directly. The solution is to modify the test file to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions, as both are valid ways for a scene to end during testing.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 317b2944-b9f3-481e-805c-bdfd82cb8be8
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} completed successfully with exit: {str(e)}")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene did not exit gracefully")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Added else clause to fail if scene doesn't exit via one of these exceptions
4. Added logging to show which exception ended the run

This maintains the architecture while properly handling the engine's expected exit conditions during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Description:
I'll modify the MainGameScene to implement the "Back" functionality during the Player Choice Phase. This requires:
- Adding a "Back" button in both the Attack and Swap submenus
- Implementing recursive choice selection that allows returning to the main menu
- Using the existing Button class from the engine
- Maintaining the same damage calculation and battle logic
- Keeping within the engine's capabilities using only _wait_for_choice and _show_text

2. Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Restructured get_player_action to use a while loop for menu navigation
2. Added "Back" button to both Attack and Swap submenus
3. Added logic to return to main menu when "Back" is selected
4. Maintained all existing battle mechanics
5. Used only engine-provided Button and SelectThing classes
6. Kept within the engine's capabilities using _wait_for_choice

This implementation now fully matches the architecture documentation while maintaining the existing functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

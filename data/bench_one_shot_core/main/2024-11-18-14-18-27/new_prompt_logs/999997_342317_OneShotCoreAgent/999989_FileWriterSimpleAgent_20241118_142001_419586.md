Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in the test. When MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, and MainMenuScene calls _quit_whole_game(), the test isn't catching this expected exception.

The solution is to:
- Modify the test to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
- Add proper mocking of _transition_to_scene like in the MainMenuScene test
- This follows the engine's pattern where tests should mock scene transitions and catch quit exceptions

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 2b1b55a6-e544-46c4-aa4d-e601e174db3e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both scene transition and quit game to catch either exit condition
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added mocking pattern similar to MainMenuScene test
3. Added TransitionFromScene exception handling
4. Properly reset mocks between iterations
5. Added better logging for different exit conditions

This maintains consistency with the engine's testing patterns while properly handling all ways a scene can exit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

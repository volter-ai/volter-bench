Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're not handling the case where a player has no valid choices for swapping creatures. This happens when:
1. The player only has one creature left with HP > 0 (their active creature)
2. We try to show swap choices but filter out the active creature and 0 HP creatures
3. This results in an empty choices list being passed to _wait_for_choice

The fix is to only show the "Swap" option if the player actually has valid creatures to swap to. This stays within the engine's capabilities and maintains the architecture.

Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: 7cbb739d-b62b-4496-8125-160f50980901

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            f"{c.display_name}: {c.hp}/{c.max_hp} HP"

```

The key changes are:
1. Check for valid swap creatures before showing the Swap button
2. Only show Swap option if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Updated the __str__ to indicate Swap is conditional
4. Use display_name for button comparison instead of direct button comparison

This maintains the architecture while preventing the empty choices list error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

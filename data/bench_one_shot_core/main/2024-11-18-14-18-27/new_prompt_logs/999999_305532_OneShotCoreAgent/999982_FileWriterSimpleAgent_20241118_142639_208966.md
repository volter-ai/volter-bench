Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill - Has type, damage, is_physical flag
- Creature - Has stats, type, skills collection
- Player - Has creatures collection
- Models must be in dependency order: Skill -> Creature -> Player

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json - Contains skill prototypes with damage values and types
- creature.json - Contains creature prototypes with stats and skill references 
- player.json - Contains player prototypes with creature references

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene - Simple menu with play/quit options
- MainGameScene - Complex battle logic with phases
  - Track current phase (player choice, foe choice, resolution)
  - Handle skill execution and damage calculation
  - Check win conditions
  - Reset state on exit

4. Create tests:
- test_main_menu_scene.py - Random choice testing
- test_main_game_scene.py - Random choice testing through full battles

Let me implement each file:

This implementation:
1. Follows the model guidelines with proper inheritance and dependency ordering
2. Uses JSON files for all prototype data
3. Implements the battle mechanics according to spec including:
   - Physical vs Special attacks
   - Type effectiveness
   - Speed-based turn order
   - HP tracking and win conditions
4. Includes proper testing with random choice runs
5. Uses proper scene transitions and bot handling
6. Shows all relevant information in scene __str__ methods

The game should now be fully playable with all the specified mechanics working correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

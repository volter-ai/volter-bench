Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill - Has type, damage, is_physical flag
- Creature - Has stats, type, skills collection
- Player - Has creatures collection
- Models must be in dependency order: Skill -> Creature -> Player

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json - Contains skill prototypes with damage values and types
- creature.json - Contains creature prototypes with stats and skill references 
- player.json - Contains player prototypes with creature references

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene - Simple menu with play/quit options
- MainGameScene - Complex battle logic with phases
  - Track current phase (player choice, foe choice, resolution)
  - Handle skill execution and damage calculation
  - Check win conditions
  - Reset state on exit

4. Create tests:
- test_main_menu_scene.py - Random choice testing
- test_main_game_scene.py - Random choice testing through full battles

Let me implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines:
1. Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
2. Models reference other models directly, not by string IDs
3. Models are in dependency order
4. Scenes handle all game logic
5. Scene transitions use proper methods
6. Tests use random mode for coverage
7. Scene __str__ methods show all relevant info
8. Models are created using from_prototype_id
9. Bots are created using create_bot and treated same as players

The game implements the full creature battle system with:
- Turn-based combat
- Physical/Special attacks
- Type effectiveness
- Speed-based turn order
- HP tracking and win conditions
- State reset on battle end

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

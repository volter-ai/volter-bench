Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. The solution is to:

1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic into the MainGameScene
3. Keep Creature as a pure data model with just attributes
4. Add a helper function in MainGameScene to handle resetting creature HP

This maintains separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while preserving the same functionality.

2. Here are the fixed files:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Added _reset_creature() helper method in MainGameScene
3. Updated the battle end code to use _reset_creature() instead of calling reset() on the models
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas

This maintains the same functionality while properly separating data and logic according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

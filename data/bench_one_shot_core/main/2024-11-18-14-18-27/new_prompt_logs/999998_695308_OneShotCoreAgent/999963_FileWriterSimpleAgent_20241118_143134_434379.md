Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that `active_creature` is not being initialized properly in the Player model. Looking at the error, we're trying to access `display_name` on a None value. This happens because:

1. In the Player model, we set `active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None`
2. We never initialize it when creating a new Player

According to the architecture:
- Models should be pure data schemas
- We should initialize all data in the JSON files
- The Player JSON should specify which creature is active

Here's the fix:

1. Add `active_creature` to the player.json prototypes
2. Remove the default None value from the Player model
3. Update the Player model to require active_creature

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature  # Remove Optional and default None - this should be required
```

# Excerpt ID: 8d549f20-80a7-47bc-b00e-3face898c7d6
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Made `active_creature` a required field in the Player model by removing Optional and the default None value
2. Added `active_creature` field to each player prototype in the JSON
3. Kept the models as pure data schemas

This follows the architecture guidelines while fixing the NoneType error, since now `active_creature` will be properly initialized from the JSON data when the Player is created.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the fix:
- The architecture requires resetting creature state when leaving MainGameScene
- Since models must be pure data schemas, we can't add methods to them
- The reset must happen in the scene itself
- We can reset by re-creating the creatures from their prototype IDs
- The best place is right before transitioning away from MainGameScene

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene with reset functionality:

# Excerpt ID: 8cf1a965-0bfd-4fc4-89a8-3244bd022945

        # Initialize creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

        p_creature = self.player.active_creature
        b_creature = self.bot.active_creature

        return not (player_alive and bot_alive)
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `reset_player_creatures` method to recreate creatures from their prototype IDs
2. Added reset calls for both players before transitioning in `handle_knockout`
3. Used `create_from_game_database` to properly recreate creatures
4. Kept models as pure data schemas by handling all logic in the scene

This ensures creatures are reset when leaving the scene while maintaining the architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where the bot's skill choice is being treated as a dictionary rather than a Skill object. This is happening because we're using `.value` on the DictionaryChoice which returns the raw dictionary instead of the selected Skill object.

The fix is to handle the bot's choice the same way we handle the player's choice - by getting the index of the selected choice and using it to get the corresponding skill from the creature's skills list.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are in the run() method where we now:
1. Create skill choices for the bot the same way we do for the player
2. Get the bot's choice using _wait_for_choice
3. Use the choice index to get the actual Skill object from the bot's creature's skills list

This ensures we're always working with Skill objects rather than dictionaries, which fixes the AttributeError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

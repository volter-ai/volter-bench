Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Creature model's `hp` field is being initialized in the `__init__` method, but according to the engine's architecture, models should be pure data schemas without methods. The `hp` field should be defined as a regular field in the class and initialized from the JSON data.

Looking at the error, we need to:
1. Remove the `__init__` method from Creature
2. Add `hp` as a regular field in the class definition
3. Make sure the JSON data includes the `hp` field for each creature

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: d83cba14-64ec-4e1c-9902-3508b8d6a62f
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And we need to update the creature.json to include hp field:

# Excerpt ID: d357671b-cbc4-404d-97e2-ded1029c5cd9
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 32,
      "max_hp": 32,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 10,
      "sp_attack": 12,
      "sp_defense": 12,
      "speed": 13,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard", 
      "description": "A fire creature",
      "creature_type": "fire",
      "hp": 40,
      "max_hp": 40,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 13,
      "sp_attack": 11,
      "sp_defense": 13,
      "speed": 11,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    },
    "dumbird": {
      "display_name": "Dumbird",
      "description": "A normal creature",
      "creature_type": "normal",
      "hp": 17,
      "max_hp": 17,
      "attack": 7,
      "defense": 9,
      "sp_attack": 7,
      "sp_defense": 4,
      "speed": 17,
      "skills": ["tackle"]
    }
  }
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `__init__` method from Creature since models should be pure data schemas
2. Added `hp` as a regular field in the Creature class
3. Added `hp` field to each creature in the JSON data, initialized to the same value as max_hp

This follows the engine's architecture by keeping models as pure data schemas and handling all initialization through the JSON data rather than methods.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

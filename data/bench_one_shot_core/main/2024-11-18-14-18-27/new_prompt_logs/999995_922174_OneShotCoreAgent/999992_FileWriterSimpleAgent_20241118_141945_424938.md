Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that MainGameScene is returning directly after a win/loss instead of properly transitioning out of the scene or quitting the game. According to the error message and engine requirements, we must either:
- Call _transition_to_scene() to go to another scene
- Call _quit_whole_game() to end the game properly

Since this is a battle game, after a battle ends (win or lose), we should:
1. Show the battle result message
2. Return to the main menu to allow playing again or quitting
3. Use _transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") instead of return statements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 394b7811-b337-4840-88f1-e4f736c64be2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolve turns
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"The foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Replaced return statements with _transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
2. This ensures proper scene transitions through the engine
3. Allows players to play multiple battles or quit from the main menu
4. Follows the engine's requirements for scene transitions

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged as the issue was specifically with scene transition handling.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

Instead of having a reset method in the Creature model, we should:
1. Move all logic to scenes
2. Handle HP reset in the MainGameScene when initializing the battle
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 29bce44f-9a7c-4975-9d12-a2c3145ec1a8
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And the corresponding change needed in main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: 4ba5e565-b03b-4ab6-b0a8-149cda22548f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start by setting hp to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} - {skill.description}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolve turns
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"The foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
                return
                
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into the MainGameScene initialization
3. Kept models as pure data schemas with only attributes

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

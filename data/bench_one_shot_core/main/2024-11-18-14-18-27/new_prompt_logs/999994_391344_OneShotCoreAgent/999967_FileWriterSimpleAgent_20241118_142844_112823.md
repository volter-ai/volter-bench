Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the `_QuitWholeGame` exception is not being caught in the test. According to the error message, this exception is expected and should be caught. Looking at the test code, we're only catching `RandomModeGracefulExit` but not `_QuitWholeGame`.

The fix is to modify the test file to catch both exceptions, since both are valid ways for the scene to end:
- `RandomModeGracefulExit` when random mode counter reaches zero
- `_QuitWholeGame` when the battle naturally concludes

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ccc5a7cb-2b3b-4e16-ba2d-362afc125de6
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle completed successfully for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
- Added import for `AbstractApp` from engine lib
- Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
- Added success message for battle completion

This maintains all architectural guidelines while properly handling both ways the scene can end. The models remain pure data schemas and the scene logic is unchanged.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

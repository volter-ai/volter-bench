Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp back to max_hp directly in the scene

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 809740e3-ca28-45ed-a5d7-91926911f2f6
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

Available Skills:

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution phase
            for skill_name, attacker, defender in [
                (player_skill.display_name, self.player_creature, self.bot_creature),
                (bot_skill.display_name, self.bot_creature, self.player_creature)
            ]:
                skill = next(s for s in attacker.skills if s.display_name == skill_name)
                defender.hp -= skill.damage
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
                
                if defender.hp <= 0:
                    winner = self.player if defender == self.bot_creature else self.bot
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                    # Reset creatures' HP before transitioning
                    self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                    self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into the MainGameScene
3. Kept models as pure data schemas
4. Maintained all game logic within scenes

This should resolve the error while maintaining the architectural requirements of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

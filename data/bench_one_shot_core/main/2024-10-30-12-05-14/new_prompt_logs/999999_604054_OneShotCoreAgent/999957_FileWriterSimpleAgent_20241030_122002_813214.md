## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the game logic. Let's address this issue and implement the correct resolution phase logic as described in the architecture documentation.

1. To fix this issue, we will modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class. We'll implement a randomized order of skill execution when the creatures have the same speed. Here's how we'll do it:

   a. Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   b. If the speeds are equal, use random.choice to determine which creature goes first.
   c. Execute the skills in the determined order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture described in the documentation.

2. Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3fb16781-384f-493a-917d-2fb920642934
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        player_speed = self.player_creature.speed
        opponent_speed = self.opponent_creature.speed

        if player_speed > opponent_speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif opponent_speed > player_speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])

            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining the order of skill execution. This aligns with the architecture documentation and should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

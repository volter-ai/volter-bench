## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' states upon exiting the MainGameScene, I will make the following changes:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll implement this reset logic directly in the scene.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 08daa6b4-b59f-49b5-80f0-f97c7d9501a4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._player_turn()
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._bot_turn()

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if choice == use_skill_button:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self._use_skill(self.player_creature, self.bot_creature, skill_choice.thing)
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def _bot_turn(self):
        bot_skill = self.bot_creature.skills[0]  # Always use the first skill for simplicity
        self._use_skill(self.bot_creature, self.player_creature, bot_skill)

    def _use_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds a new `_reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot to their maximum values. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene and when quitting the game from the MainGameScene.

The changes ensure that:
1. The creatures' states are reset after each battle, as specified in the architecture documentation.
2. The reset logic is implemented in the scene, not in the models, adhering to the guideline that models should be pure data schemas.
3. The player is informed that the creatures have been restored to full health, providing feedback about the state reset.

These modifications address the issue raised during QA/testing while maintaining compliance with the provided guidelines and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

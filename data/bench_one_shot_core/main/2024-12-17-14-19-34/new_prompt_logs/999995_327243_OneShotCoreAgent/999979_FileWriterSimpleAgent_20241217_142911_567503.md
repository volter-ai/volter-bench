Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because in MainGameScene.execute_turn(), we're getting a Creature object instead of a Skill object when trying to access skill.is_physical. This is happening because SelectThing.thing is being passed directly, but we need to ensure we're getting the Skill object.

The issue stems from how we're handling the SelectThing choices. When creating SelectThing objects, we need to ensure we're properly passing and accessing the Skill objects rather than Creatures.

2. Solution:
We need to fix the MainGameScene class to properly handle the SelectThing objects for skills vs creatures. The key changes will be:
- Modify how we create and handle SelectThing objects for skills
- Ensure we properly extract the skill object when executing turns
- Add proper type checking to distinguish between skill actions and creature swaps

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key fixes are:
1. Added proper type hints for the skill parameter in calculate_damage
2. Modified execute_turn to properly access the thing attribute of SelectThing objects
3. Added checks to ensure both players made valid choices before executing the turn
4. Properly handled the distinction between Skill and Creature objects when processing actions

This should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the proper architecture and model relationships.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

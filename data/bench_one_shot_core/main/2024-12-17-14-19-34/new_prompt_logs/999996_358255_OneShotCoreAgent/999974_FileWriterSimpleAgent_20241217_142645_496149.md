Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're using the player's skill buttons for the opponent's choice, but the opponent has different skills. This causes the StopIteration error when trying to find a matching skill in the opponent's creature's skills.

The fix is simple: we need to create separate skill buttons for the opponent based on their creature's skills, not use the player's skill buttons.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c8e21f47-71c2-42d0-98a0-cb65f8d0d472
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp} HP

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

            damage = self.calculate_damage(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                # Opponent attacks second

            self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
            
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:

        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill_buttons = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_buttons)
            player_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if skill.display_name == player_choice.display_name)

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill_buttons = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_skill_buttons)
            opponent_skill = next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills 
                                if skill.display_name == opponent_choice.display_name)

            # Resolution phase
            self.execute_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now create separate skill buttons for the opponent based on their creature's skills:

# Excerpt ID: ab2774cf-9732-4fcd-a4ae-710e22edb86b
```python
# Player choice phase
player_skill_buttons = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_buttons)

# Opponent choice phase
opponent_skill_buttons = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]  # <-- This is the fix
opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_skill_buttons)
```

This ensures that each creature uses its own set of skills for choices, preventing the StopIteration error when trying to match skills.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because it's not catching the expected GracefulExit exception that occurs when quitting the game. According to the engine's design, GracefulExit exceptions should be caught in tests.

Looking at the test_main_menu_scene.py, we can see it properly handles these exceptions by catching them in the test. We should do the same for the main game scene test.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: bd93a25c-77c9-4d24-92ce-427ffd8a0f2f
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, GracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle might take more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except GracefulExit:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for GracefulExit from the engine lib
2. Added exception handler for GracefulExit in the test loop
3. Added explicit re-raising of unexpected exceptions for better error reporting

This fix allows the test to properly handle both:
- RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves run out)
- GracefulExit (when the game quits normally)

The test will now pass while still verifying that the game scene works correctly through multiple random playthroughs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since this is a required field according to the model, we need to handle it properly.

Looking at the architecture:
1. We can't add methods to models.py since models must be pure data schemas
2. We need to initialize active_creature when creating a Player
3. The proper place to handle this is in the JSON data since that's where we define our prototypes

The solution is to:
1. Make active_creature optional in the Player model by using Optional[Creature]
2. Initialize it in the JSON as the first creature in the list
3. Keep the reset logic in MainGameScene

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 9473c937-af4a-49a1-b5cd-e51c41efd1a8
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

And update the player.json:

# Excerpt ID: 426b4f67-3be7-458b-946c-504398a4d2fb
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The default player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "bubwool"
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": "scizard"
    }
  }
}
```

This solution:
1. Follows the pure data schema requirement for models
2. Properly initializes the active_creature through the JSON data
3. Maintains the ability to reset creature state in MainGameScene
4. Uses Optional to handle cases where active_creature might not be set
5. Keeps the initialization of game state in the data layer rather than code

The changes make the model more flexible while maintaining the architectural constraints of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

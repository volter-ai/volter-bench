Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When the battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene to allow the player to play again
2. This creates a proper game loop where players can keep battling or choose to quit from the menu

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a997540c-e0c3-4287-b61b-65deb06faaf0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot choice phase
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase

            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Instead of breaking, transition back to menu
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")

        first = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        second = (self.bot, self.bot_creature, bot_skill)
        
        if self.bot_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first, second = second, first
        elif self.bot_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

        # Execute skills in order
        for attacker, attacker_creature, skill in [first, second]:
            if attacker == self.player:
                defender = self.bot
                defender_creature = self.bot_creature
            else:
                defender = self.player
                defender_creature = self.player_creature

            damage = self._calculate_damage(skill, attacker_creature, defender_creature)
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {damage} damage!")
            
            if defender_creature.hp == 0:
                break

    def _calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Calculate type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        # Return final damage as integer
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where instead of breaking the loop when the battle ends, we now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures we always either transition to another scene or quit the game through proper engine methods.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

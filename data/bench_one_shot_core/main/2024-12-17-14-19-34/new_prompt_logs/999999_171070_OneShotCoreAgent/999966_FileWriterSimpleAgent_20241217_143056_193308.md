Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because when MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, the menu scene is quitting the game, which raises an uncaught _QuitWholeGame exception.

For testing MainGameScene in isolation, we should:
1. Mock the _transition_to_scene method to prevent actual scene transitions
2. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Consider both exceptions as valid test completions

This follows the engine architecture because:
- We're not modifying any models
- We're keeping scene transitions within the engine's capabilities
- We're properly handling the engine's expected exceptions

2. Here's the fixed implementation:

# Excerpt ID: ab05ccea-fd52-47f7-9cb0-7479ebf9c04e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"scene transitioned successfully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                
                # Verify we either transitioned or hit random mode limit
                assert mock_transition.called or HumanListener.random_mode_counter <= 0, \
                    "Scene must either transition or exhaust random mode counter"
```

Key changes:
1. Added TransitionFromScene exception to catch scene transitions
2. Added proper exception handling for all expected exceptions
3. Added assertion to verify scene either transitioned or exhausted random moves
4. Mocked _transition_to_scene to prevent actual scene transitions
5. Added proper output messages for different exit conditions

This maintains the engine architecture while properly testing the MainGameScene in isolation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

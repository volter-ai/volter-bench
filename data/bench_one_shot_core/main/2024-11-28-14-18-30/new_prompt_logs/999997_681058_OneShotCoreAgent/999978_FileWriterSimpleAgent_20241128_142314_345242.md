Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene breaks from its game loop instead of properly ending the game by calling `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game - they cannot just return or break.

The fix is simple - we need to modify the MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends instead of breaking from the loop.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 224fca01-038b-4df9-849f-ba620d08a676
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5
            
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)
        second_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Check if battle ended
        if second_creature.hp <= 0:
            return
            
        # Second attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
        first_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Determine order
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.player_creature, player_choice)
                second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_choice)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_choice)
                second = (self.player_creature, player_choice)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, player_choice)
                    second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_choice)
                else:
                    first = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_choice)
                    second = (self.player_creature, player_choice)
                    
            # Execute turn
            self.execute_turn(first[0], second[0], first[1], second[1])
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game instead of breaking
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game instead of breaking
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `break` statements at the end of the game
2. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when either player wins or loses

This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's expected mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop. The rest of the battle logic remains unchanged.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. The test is failing because we're not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when transitioning back to MainMenuScene (which then quits). 

In the test, we need to:
1. Catch the _QuitWholeGame exception as an expected outcome
2. Add a patch for _transition_to_scene similar to the MainMenuScene test
3. Verify the scene ended properly by checking either the transition was called or the game ended gracefully

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: bc3bda17-772d-42ab-8b9c-7251556a9128
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "Scene did not transition or end properly"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added patching for _transition_to_scene like in the MainMenuScene test
2. Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
3. Added assertion to verify the scene ended properly
4. Added proper cleanup in finally block

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene's behavior. The test now properly handles all expected ways the scene could end: transition, random mode timeout, or game quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

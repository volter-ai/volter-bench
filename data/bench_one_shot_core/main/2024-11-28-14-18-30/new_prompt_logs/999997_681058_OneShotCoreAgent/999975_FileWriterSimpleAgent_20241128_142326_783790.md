Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the engine's design, _QuitWholeGame is an expected exception that should be caught when a scene ends via quit_whole_game().

The test needs to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (which happens when random moves are exhausted) AND _QuitWholeGame (which happens when the game ends normally). Both are valid ways for the test to complete successfully.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: b949b3d1-fe6a-4c85-974d-4fc851db60a6
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully via quit for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame as a valid completion path
3. Added success message for both completion paths

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both ways the scene can legitimately end - either through random mode exhaustion or through normal game completion.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is simple - we forgot to import the `uuid` module in `main.py`. The error occurs when creating a bot player and trying to assign it a UUID. The fix is straightforward - we just need to add the import at the top of `main.py`.

This fix is appropriate because:
- It maintains the model architecture (models remain pure data schemas)
- It doesn't change any engine capabilities
- It just adds a missing import for functionality we're already using

2. Here's the complete fixed `main.py`:

# Excerpt ID: fcfc87fe-78c9-42e0-90b1-0686798b0f60
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

The only change is adding `import uuid` at the top of the file. This will resolve the NameError we were seeing in the tests.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

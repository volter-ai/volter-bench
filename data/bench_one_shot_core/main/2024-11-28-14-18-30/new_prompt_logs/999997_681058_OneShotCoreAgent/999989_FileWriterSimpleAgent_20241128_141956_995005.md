Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that occurs when transitioning back to MainMenuScene (which then quits). 

According to the engine architecture:
- Tests should catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
- We should verify the scene exited in an expected way
- We need to patch both transition and quit methods to properly test scene behavior

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: c505ae3a-0c5c-4c6b-b946-8bca6c20e7f2
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both exit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
- Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
- Added proper patching of both transition and quit methods
- Added proper assertions to verify scene exits correctly
- Follows the same pattern as the MainMenuScene test
- Maintains all test requirements while properly handling scene transitions

This fix ensures the test properly handles all ways the scene can exit while still verifying the scene's behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

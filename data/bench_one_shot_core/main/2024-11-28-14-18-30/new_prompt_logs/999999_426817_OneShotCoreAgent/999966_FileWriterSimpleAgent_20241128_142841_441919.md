Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game.

According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

The solution is to modify MainGameScene to properly transition back to MainMenuScene after a battle ends, giving players the option to play again or quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 9c3f18b5-1a45-4534-a03d-496e02c5d292
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added a "Continue" button after battle end
2. Added proper scene transition back to MainMenuScene
3. Removed the direct return from run() method

This ensures the scene always ends with a proper transition, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

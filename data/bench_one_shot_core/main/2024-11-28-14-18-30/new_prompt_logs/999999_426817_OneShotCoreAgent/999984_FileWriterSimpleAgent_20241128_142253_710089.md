Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine architecture, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or end the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

Solution:
I'll modify MainGameScene to return to the MainMenuScene after displaying the battle result. This creates a proper game loop where players can:
1. Start at main menu
2. Play a battle
3. Return to main menu to play again or quit

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        effectiveness = "It's super effective!" if damage > skill.base_damage else "It's not very effective..." if damage < skill.base_damage else ""

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends
2. Added `return` statements after the transitions to properly exit the scene
3. Kept all the battle logic intact while ensuring proper scene flow

This maintains the engine's architecture requirements while creating a complete game loop where players can play multiple battles or quit from the main menu.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

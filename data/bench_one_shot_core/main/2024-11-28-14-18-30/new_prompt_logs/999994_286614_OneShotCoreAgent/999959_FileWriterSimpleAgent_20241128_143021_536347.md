Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Analysis:
The issue is that during the Player Choice Phase, players should be able to go "Back" to the previous set of choices. According to the documentation:
- When choosing a skill after selecting "Attack", players should be able to go back to the main action choice
- When choosing a creature after selecting "Swap", players should be able to go back to the main action choice
- This requires adding a "Back" button to the secondary choice menus
- The engine supports this through the Button class

I'll modify the MainGameScene to implement this feature. The key changes will be:
- Add a "Back" button to skill selection and creature selection menus
- Handle the "Back" choice by repeating the main action choice
- Update the scene's string representation to show the back option when relevant

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Modified get_player_action() to use a while loop for handling back navigation
2. Added "Back" button to both skill selection and creature selection menus
3. Used continue to return to the main choice when "Back" is selected
4. No changes needed to models or other components since this was purely a scene logic issue

This implementation now fully matches the documentation requirements while maintaining the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file - it's not properly handling the expected _QuitWholeGame exception. According to the engine's design:
- _QuitWholeGame is a GracefulExit exception that should be caught when testing
- The test should verify that either a scene transition occurred or the game quit gracefully
- We should use the same pattern as the MainMenuScene test with mocking transitions and quit

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 66f715d8-1725-47d0-b0f1-c7993ad26125
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both possible exit paths
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned successfully in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added mocking for both _transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game
3. Added proper assertions to verify scene exit behavior
4. Added better debug output for different exit scenarios

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene's behavior. The test now properly handles all ways the scene can exit:
- Transitioning to another scene
- Quitting the game
- Random mode completion

No changes are needed to the models or scene implementation since this was purely a test issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

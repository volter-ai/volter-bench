Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene returns directly when the battle ends instead of properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

Solution approach:
- When a battle ends, we should return to the main menu if the player wants to play again
- Or quit the game if they don't
- We'll add a prompt after the battle ends asking the player if they want to play again
- This maintains proper scene flow according to the engine's requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Modified the battle end logic in run() to properly transition or quit
2. Added a "Play Again" or "Quit" choice when the battle ends
3. Used proper scene transitions instead of returning directly
4. No changes needed to other files since this was a scene flow issue

This maintains the engine's requirements while providing a proper game flow where players can either play again or quit after a battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that we're trying to call `reset()` on Creature instances, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. Instead of having a reset method, we should handle the HP reset directly in the scene by setting the HP back to max_hp. This keeps our models as pure data schemas while maintaining the game functionality.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: c2eb03fa-34f1-4359-944b-1f7560f3477d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills])

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.thing.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.thing.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.thing.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.thing.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        """Reset creature HP to their max values"""
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

The key changes:
- Removed the call to reset() method
- Instead directly set hp back to max_hp in _reset_creatures()
- Kept models as pure data schemas
- Maintained all game functionality
- Scene continues to handle all game logic

This should resolve the test failures while staying within the architectural constraints.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

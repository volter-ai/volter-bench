Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or loss), it just breaks from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

Solution:
I'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game when the battle is over by calling `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the win/loss message. This follows the architecture since this is meant to be a simple game where you play one battle and then the game ends.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: eca3ab0c-f690-4a7d-917a-c6920dd7aba0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0

        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5
            
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)
        second_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Second attack if target still alive
        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
            first_creature.hp -= damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Bot choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing
            
            # Resolution phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
                    
            self.execute_turn(*first)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # End game after victory
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._quit_whole_game()  # End game after defeat
```

The key change is replacing the `break` statements with `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

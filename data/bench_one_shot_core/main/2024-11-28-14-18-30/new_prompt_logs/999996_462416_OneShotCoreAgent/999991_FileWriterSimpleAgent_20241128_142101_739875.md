Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset_creatures` method to the Player model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset_creatures` method from the Player model
2. Move this logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Update the scene to handle creature HP reset directly

The models should only contain data fields, while all logic should live in the scenes.

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A battle begins!")
        
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
            choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in player_creature.skills]
            self.player_skill_choice = player_creature.skills[
                choices.index(self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices))
            ]

            # Bot choice phase
            bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
            bot_choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in bot_creature.skills]
            self.bot_skill_choice = bot_creature.skills[

            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {self.player_skill_choice.display_name}!")
            bot_creature.hp -= self.player_skill_choice.damage
            
            if bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._reset_creatures(self.player)
                self._reset_creatures(self.bot)
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {self.bot_skill_choice.display_name}!")
            player_creature.hp -= self.bot_skill_choice.damage

            if player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._reset_creatures(self.player)
                self._reset_creatures(self.bot)
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset_creatures` method from Player model
2. Added `_reset_creatures` as a private method in MainGameScene
3. Updated the battle end conditions to reset both players' creatures before transitioning
4. Models are now pure data schemas as required

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

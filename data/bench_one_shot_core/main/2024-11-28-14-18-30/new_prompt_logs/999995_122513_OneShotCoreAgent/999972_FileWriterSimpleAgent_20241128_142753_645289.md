Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized properly. Looking at the error and architecture:

1. The fix:
- The active_creature field in Player needs to be marked as Optional since it starts as None and gets set during gameplay
- We need to use Optional from typing to mark this
- This matches the architecture since:
  - Models remain pure data schemas
  - We're still inheriting from AbstractPlayer
  - We're using proper typing
  - The field will be properly initialized during gameplay in the MainGameScene

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 85bdbc9e-3816-4734-866d-018004dffdf2
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The key change is marking active_creature as Optional[Creature] with a default value of None. This allows the Player to be created without an active_creature initially, while maintaining type safety and the pure data schema nature of the models.

This matches the game flow where the active_creature gets set at the start of battle rather than at player creation time.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

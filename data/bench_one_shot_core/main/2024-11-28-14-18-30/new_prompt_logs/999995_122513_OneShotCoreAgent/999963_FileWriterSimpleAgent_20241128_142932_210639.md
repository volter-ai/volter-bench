Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
- The error shows that MainGameScene is terminating without properly transitioning or quitting
- When the battle ends (win/loss), we're just breaking from the loop instead of properly ending the game
- According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
  - Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene`
  - Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game`
- The fix is to:
  - Modify MainGameScene to call `_quit_whole_game` when the battle ends
  - This stays within engine capabilities and doesn't affect the models

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` when battle ends
2. Removed redundant battle end check after turn
3. Removed break statement in favor of proper game termination
4. Added return after quit to ensure clean exit

This ensures the scene always ends properly through the engine's mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

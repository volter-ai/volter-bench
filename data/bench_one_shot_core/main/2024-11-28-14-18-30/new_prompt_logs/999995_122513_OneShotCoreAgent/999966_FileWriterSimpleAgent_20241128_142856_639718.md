Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but the list is empty. This happens when all creatures are either knocked out or are the active creature. We need to handle this case by:

1. When no swap choices are available, we should only show the Attack option
2. If all creatures are knocked out, we need to handle that in check_battle_end()
3. This stays within engine capabilities since we're just modifying scene logic
4. No changes needed to models since they're correct as data schemas

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added get_available_creatures helper method
2. Modified get_player_action to:
   - Handle knocked out active creatures
   - Only show Swap option if creatures are available
   - Return a "No Action" button if no choices available
3. Modified resolve_turn to handle "No Action" cases
4. Added battle end check at start of turn
5. Improved string representation to indicate Swap is conditional

This fixes the empty choices issue while maintaining the game's architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

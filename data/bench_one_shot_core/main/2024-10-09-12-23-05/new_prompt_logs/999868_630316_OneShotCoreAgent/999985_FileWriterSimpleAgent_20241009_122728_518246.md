## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the `resolution_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The `execute_skill` method expects 5 arguments, but we're only passing 3 when we unpack the `first` and `second` tuples. To fix this, we need to modify the `determine_order` method to return tuples with all the necessary information for `execute_skill`.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Modify the `determine_order` method to return tuples with all 5 arguments needed for `execute_skill`.
2. Update the `resolution_phase` method to correctly unpack these tuples when calling `execute_skill`.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture and model guidelines. The models will remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic will be contained within the scene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 8ea7a90b-8983-4141-896f-dd062a65773a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature, skill1: Skill, skill2: Skill):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature), \
                   (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2, self.player, self.player_creature)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2, self.player, self.player_creature), \
                   (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature), \
                       (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2, self.player, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2, self.player, self.player_creature), \
                       (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the TypeError by ensuring that the `determine_order` method returns tuples with all 5 arguments needed for `execute_skill`. The `resolution_phase` method now correctly unpacks these tuples when calling `execute_skill`.

These changes should resolve the issue while maintaining the existing architecture and adhering to the model guidelines. The game logic remains contained within the scene, and the models are still pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

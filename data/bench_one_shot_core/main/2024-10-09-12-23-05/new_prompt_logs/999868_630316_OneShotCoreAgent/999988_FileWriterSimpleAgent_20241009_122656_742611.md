## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The main problem is in the `determine_order` method of the `MainGameScene` class, where `player_skill` and `foe_skill` are not defined. To fix this, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` and `determine_order` methods to properly handle the skills.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to pass the skills to the `determine_order` method.
2. We'll update the `determine_order` method to accept the skills as parameters.
3. We'll ensure that the skills are properly used in the `execute_skill` method.

These changes will address the NameError and ensure that the chosen skills are used correctly in the battle.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 950d16d6-ad45-438d-b207-d79651fcf58b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)
        
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature, skill1: Skill, skill2: Skill):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, skill2), (self.player, self.player_creature, skill1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the NameError issue by properly passing and using the skills throughout the battle process. The `determine_order` method now accepts the skills as parameters, and the `resolution_phase` method passes these skills to `determine_order`. The `execute_skill` method has been updated to accept the skill as a parameter and use it in the damage calculation.

This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture and model guidelines. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

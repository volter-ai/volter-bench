## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is happening because the battle ends without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, we'll add a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after displaying the battle result.
2. We'll also add a short delay using `time.sleep()` before transitioning, so the player can see the battle result.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 41f619a7-725f-4d68-bf23-6a068a0d552b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import time

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0], second[1])
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0], first[1])

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        skill = attacker_creature.skills[0]  # For simplicity, always use the first skill
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Add a short delay
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            time.sleep(2)  # Add a short delay
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, fixing the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The added delay allows the player to see the battle result before transitioning.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and model structure while addressing the specific issue raised in the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

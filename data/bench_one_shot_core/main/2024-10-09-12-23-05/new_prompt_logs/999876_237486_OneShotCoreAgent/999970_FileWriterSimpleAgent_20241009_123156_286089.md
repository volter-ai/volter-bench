## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the test failures, we need to focus on two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the `choose_swap` method is being called with no available creatures, leading to an empty choices list.
2. The `MainGameScene` is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll add a check to ensure there are available creatures before creating choices. If there are no available creatures, we'll return None.
2. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method to properly handle the end of the battle by calling `quit_whole_game` when the battle ends.
3. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 6c018650-d1c4-44b8-9117-a5005db591fc

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            for creature in player.creatures:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Handling the case where there are no available creatures to swap in the `choose_swap` method.
2. Ensuring that the battle loop ends properly by calling `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends.
3. Improving the bot's behavior to choose an attack if no swap is available.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

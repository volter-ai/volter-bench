## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random decision for execution order when creatures have equal speed.
2. Add the Leaf type to the weakness-resistance calculations.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolve_turn` method, I'll add a condition to randomly decide the order when speeds are equal.
2. In the `_calculate_weakness_factor` method, I'll include the Leaf type in the effectiveness calculations.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `_resolve_turn` method now includes a random decision when the creatures have equal speed, using `random.choice([True, False])` to determine the order.
2. The `_calculate_weakness_factor` method now properly handles all type relationships, including the Leaf type.

The rest of the implementation remains the same, maintaining the overall architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Handle equal speed scenarios in the Resolution Phase.
3. Ensure floats are used throughout the damage calculation before converting to an integer.

Here's how we'll implement these changes:

1. We'll add a 'Back' button in the player_turn method when choosing an attack or swap.
2. In the resolve_turn method, we'll modify the sorting of actions to include a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.
3. We'll update the calculate_damage method to use floats throughout the calculation before converting to an integer at the end.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The 'Back' option is now available in both the attack and swap choices for the player.
2. Equal speed scenarios are now handled by adding a random tiebreaker when sorting actions in the resolve_turn method.
3. Floats are now used throughout the damage calculation in the calculate_damage method, with the final result being converted to an integer.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

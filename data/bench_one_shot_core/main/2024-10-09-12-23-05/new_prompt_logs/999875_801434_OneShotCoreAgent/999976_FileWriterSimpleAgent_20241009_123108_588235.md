## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Update the `_get_type_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class to handle the 'Normal' type correctly.
2. Add a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I'll fix each issue:

1. For the 'Normal' type, I'll modify the `_get_type_factor` method to return 1 (neutral effectiveness) for any 'Normal' type skill, regardless of the defender's type.

2. I'll add a new method called `_reset_creatures` that will be called before transitioning out of the scene. This method will restore the HP of all creatures to their maximum values.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e4ce9e56-a800-4d1f-bcdd-1a47a83a608d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self):

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense

            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type.lower() == "normal":
            return 1  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type.lower(), {}).get(defender_type.lower(), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._reset_creatures()

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Normal' type is now handled correctly in the `_get_type_factor` method, always returning 1 (neutral effectiveness) for 'Normal' type skills.

2. The `_reset_creatures` method is added and called before transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`. This method restores the HP of all creatures to their maximum values, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the battle scene.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be changed, as it already contains the necessary attributes for the creatures, including `hp` and `max_hp`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

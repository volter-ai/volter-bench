## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Add an explicit welcome message in the MainMenuScene.
2. Indicate whose turn it is during choice phases in the MainGameScene.
3. Remove the minimum damage calculation as it wasn't specified in the architecture.
4. Reset creature HP between battles.
5. Remove the 'Play Again' option after battles and instead transition directly back to the MainMenuScene.

To implement these changes, we need to modify both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. I'll rewrite both files with the proposed solutions:

        return False
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The MainMenuScene now displays an explicit welcome message.
2. The MainGameScene now indicates whose turn it is during choice phases.
3. The minimum damage calculation has been removed.
4. Creature HP is reset between battles using the `reset_creatures` method.
5. The 'Play Again' option has been removed, and the scene transitions directly back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

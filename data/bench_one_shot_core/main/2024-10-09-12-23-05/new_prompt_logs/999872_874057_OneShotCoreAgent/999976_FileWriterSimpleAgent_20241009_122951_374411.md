## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue raised during QA/testing. To address this, we need to align our implementation more closely with the architecture documentation. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Remove the explicit welcome message from the MainMenuScene's run method, as it's not specified in the architecture.
2. Remove additional features like showing messages for skill usage and damage dealt in the MainGameScene, as these are not described in the architecture.
3. Simplify the MainGameScene to match the architecture more closely, focusing only on the specified phases and logic.

I'll rewrite the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene to address these issues:

# Excerpt ID: f2db8453-6f6e-4b90-a726-fc797d4300a5
```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def __str__(self):
        return """===Main Menu===
Welcome to Creature Battler

> Play
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            play_button = Button("Play")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [play_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if choice == play_button:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
            elif choice == quit_button:
                self._quit_whole_game()
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.determine_first_attacker():
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def determine_first_attacker(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return False
        else:
            return random.choice([True, False])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The explicit welcome message has been removed from the MainMenuScene's run method.
2. Additional features like showing messages for skill usage and damage dealt have been removed from the MainGameScene.
3. The MainGameScene has been simplified to match the architecture more closely, focusing only on the specified phases and logic.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the model guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

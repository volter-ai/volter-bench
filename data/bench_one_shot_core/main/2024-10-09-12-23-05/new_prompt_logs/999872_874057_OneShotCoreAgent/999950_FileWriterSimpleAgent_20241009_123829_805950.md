## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during the QA/testing phase, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Add an explicit reset of the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene:
   - We'll add a `_reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP.
   - We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Adjust the damage calculation to apply the weakness factor before converting to an integer:
   - In the `_execute_skill` method, we'll modify the order of operations to apply the weakness factor before rounding to an integer.

These changes will be implemented within the existing architecture and capabilities of the engine, without modifying the models or adding new methods to them.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. An explicit reset of the player's creatures' state is now performed by calling `self._reset_creatures()` just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. The damage calculation in the `_execute_skill` method now applies the weakness factor before converting to an integer, which should lead to more accurate results.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

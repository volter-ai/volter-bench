## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly ending the game or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The turn_queue attribute in MainGameScene is causing serialization warnings.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends (either when a player wins or loses).
2. We'll remove the turn_queue attribute from the MainGameScene class and instead use a local variable within the resolution_phase method.

These changes will ensure that the scene properly ends and transitions, and it will remove the serialization warnings.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the main issues:

1. We've added a transition back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the game_loop method, ensuring that the scene properly ends and transitions when the battle is over.
2. We've removed the turn_queue attribute and instead use local variables within the _resolution_phase method to handle the turn order and actions.

These modifications should resolve the FixableException and the serialization warnings while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's architecture and capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. I'll address the issues raised in the QA report and propose a solution that aligns with the original architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Change the 'Tackle' skill type back to 'normal' in the skill.json file.
   b. Implement the 'Normal' type in the weakness-resistance calculations in the MainGameScene.
   c. Remove the additional creatures and skills not mentioned in the architecture (Leafeon and Vine Whip).

2. I'll rewrite the necessary files to implement these fixes:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The 'Tackle' skill type has been changed back to 'normal' in the skill.json file.
2. The 'Normal' type has been implemented in the weakness-resistance calculations in the MainGameScene's `_calculate_weakness_factor` method.
3. The additional creatures and skills not mentioned in the architecture (Leafeon and Vine Whip) have been removed from the JSON files.

These modifications align the implementation with the original architecture requirements and address the issues raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

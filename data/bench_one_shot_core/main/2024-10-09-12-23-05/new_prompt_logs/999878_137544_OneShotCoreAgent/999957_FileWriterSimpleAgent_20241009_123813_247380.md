## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed issue. I understand that we need to implement the handling of a swapped-in creature getting hit by the opponent's queued skill. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class to handle the case where a swapped-in creature gets hit by the opponent's queued skill.
2. We'll implement a new method called `_apply_queued_skill` to handle the application of a queued skill to a swapped-in creature.
3. We'll update the sorting of the turn queue to ensure that swap actions are always executed before attack actions.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9e6e2b64-e2ce-4201-bd51-a54515b18a4b

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. We've modified the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case where a swapped-in creature gets hit by the opponent's queued skill:

# Excerpt ID: d43ab5be-5bbd-4545-8dc9-be64e93bb3cf
```python
def _resolution_phase(self):
    # Sort the turn queue: swaps first, then by speed (higher speed first), then randomly
    self.turn_queue.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] != "swap", -x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random()))
    
    for i, (player, action_type, action) in enumerate(self.turn_queue):
        if action_type == "swap":
            old_creature = player.active_creature
            player.active_creature = action
            self._show_text(player, f"{player.display_name} swapped {old_creature.display_name} for {action.display_name}!")
            
            # Check if there's a queued attack from the opponent
            opponent = self.bot if player == self.player else self.player
            opponent_action = next((act for act in self.turn_queue[i+1:] if act[0] == opponent and act[1] == "attack"), None)
            
            if opponent_action:
                self._apply_queued_skill(opponent, opponent_action[2], player)
        elif action_type == "attack":
            self._execute_skill(player, action)

    self.turn_queue.clear()
```

2. We've added a new `_apply_queued_skill` method to handle the application of a queued skill to a swapped-in creature:

# Excerpt ID: 10d24956-d7ff-4003-bd0d-3f8a1750a8f4
```python
def _apply_queued_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
    self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.active_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} on the swapped-in creature!")
    self._execute_skill(attacker, skill, defender.active_creature)
```

3. We've updated the `_execute_skill` method to accept an optional `defender_creature` parameter:

# Excerpt ID: 5edea5f7-5c51-47de-9f41-a407365f9f37
```python
def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender_creature=None):
    defender = self.bot if attacker == self.player else self.player
    if defender_creature is None:
        defender_creature = defender.active_creature

    # ... (rest of the method remains the same)
```

These changes ensure that when a player swaps their creature, the opponent's queued skill is applied to the swapped-in creature, as described in the architecture document. The rest of the implementation remains unchanged, preserving the overall structure and functionality of the game while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to ensure that the player's creatures' state is explicitly reset when leaving the MainGameScene. This functionality is mentioned in the architecture document but was not clearly implemented in the code. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file.
2. We'll add a new method called `_exit_scene` that will be responsible for resetting the creatures' state and transitioning to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll call this new `_exit_scene` method at the end of the `game_loop` method instead of directly transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 393a1156-2717-4f81-bf7e-4c5b516949c6

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

        return f"""===Battle===

    def _exit_scene(self):
        self._reset_creatures()  # Explicitly reset creatures' state
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. We've added a new `_exit_scene` method that combines resetting the creatures' state and transitioning to the MainMenuScene:

# Excerpt ID: 5cfbd13b-e5e7-439a-bffc-0c91d0750090
```python
def _exit_scene(self):
    self._reset_creatures()  # Explicitly reset creatures' state
    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

2. We've modified the `game_loop` method to call `self._exit_scene()` instead of directly transitioning to the MainMenuScene:

# Excerpt ID: d8276627-b221-4441-aa66-1871d406c365
```python
def game_loop(self):
    while True:
        self._player_choice_phase(self.player)
        self._player_choice_phase(self.bot)
        self._resolution_phase()

        if self._check_battle_end():
            break

    self._show_battle_result()
    self._exit_scene()
```

These changes ensure that the player's creatures' state is explicitly reset when leaving the MainGameScene, as mentioned in the architecture document. The rest of the implementation remains unchanged, preserving the overall structure and functionality of the game while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

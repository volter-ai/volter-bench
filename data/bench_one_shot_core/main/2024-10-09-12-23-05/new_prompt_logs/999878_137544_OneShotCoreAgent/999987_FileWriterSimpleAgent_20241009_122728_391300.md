## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle loop is not continuing after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle loop to continue until the player chooses to quit.
3. We'll add a "Return to Main Menu" option after each battle.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 567d4487-4d56-4ec5-bc0e-068252b86515
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = None
        self.player_creature = None
        self.opponent_creature = None

    def __str__(self):
        if not self.player_creature or not self.opponent_creature:
            return "=== Battle Scene ==="
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.start_new_battle()
            self.battle_loop()
            if not self.play_again():
                break
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def start_new_battle(self):
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn

                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = max(1, int(raw_damage * type_factor))
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        return_to_menu_button = Button("Return to Main Menu")
        choices = [play_again_button, return_to_menu_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a main game loop in the `run` method that starts new battles and checks if the player wants to play again.
2. Implementing a `play_again` method that gives the player the option to start a new battle or return to the main menu.
3. Transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` when the player chooses to quit.
4. Resetting the battle state (opponent, creatures) at the start of each new battle.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always exits properly, either by starting a new battle or returning to the main menu. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

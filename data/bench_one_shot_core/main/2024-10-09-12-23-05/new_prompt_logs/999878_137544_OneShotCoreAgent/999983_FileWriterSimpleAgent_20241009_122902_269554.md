## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA report, we need to make two main changes:

1. Implement random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal.
2. Add the 'Leaf' type to the game by creating a new creature and skill that use this type.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method to use a random decision when speeds are equal.
2. We'll add a new 'Leaf' type creature and a corresponding 'Leaf' type skill in the JSON files.

Let's rewrite the necessary files:

# Excerpt ID: ed2cb198-3901-4ea1-b9ef-3bcfe5087068
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = None
        self.player_creature = None
        self.opponent_creature = None

    def __str__(self):
        if not self.player_creature or not self.opponent_creature:
            return "=== Battle Scene ==="
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Random decision when speeds are equal
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = max(1, int(raw_damage * type_factor))

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button
```

Now, let's update the JSON files to include the new 'Leaf' type creature and skill:

# Excerpt ID: 11c90ac7-7125-43b0-bb96-12b0580273cd
```json main_game/content/skill.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "tackle": {
      "display_name": "Tackle",
      "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "normal",
      "base_damage": 3
    },
    "fireball": {
      "display_name": "Fireball",
      "description": "Throw fire at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "fire",
      "base_damage": 2
    },
    "lick": {
      "display_name": "Lick",
      "description": "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "water",
      "base_damage": 2
    },
    "leaf_blade": {
      "display_name": "Leaf Blade",
      "description": "Slash the foe with a sharp leaf, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "leaf",
      "base_damage": 2
    }
  }
}
```

# Excerpt ID: 1df03dec-0834-441e-a1d5-5afad668c2b1
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water-type creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 10,
      "max_hp": 10,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 2,
      "speed": 4,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard",
      "description": "A fire-type creature",
      "creature_type": "fire",
      "hp": 11,
      "max_hp": 11,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 3,
      "speed": 3,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    },
    "leafeon": {
      "display_name": "Leafeon",
      "description": "A leaf-type creature",
      "creature_type": "leaf",
      "hp": 10,
      "max_hp": 10,
      "attack": 3,
      "defense": 2,
      "speed": 4,
      "skills": ["tackle", "leaf_blade"]
    }
  }
}
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Implementing a random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal in the `resolve_turn` method of `MainGameScene`.
2. Adding a new 'Leaf' type creature (Leafeon) and a corresponding 'Leaf' type skill (Leaf Blade) in the JSON files.

The `models.py` file doesn't need to be changed as it already supports these additions. The new creature and skill will be automatically loaded from the JSON files when needed.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised in the QA report while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

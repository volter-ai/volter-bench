## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement a queue for skills in the Resolution Phase:
   - Create a list to store the queued skills for both players.
   - Modify the player_choice_phase and foe_choice_phase methods to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
   - Update the resolution_phase method to process skills from the queue.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - Add a method to reset creature HP to its maximum value.
   - Call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the updated `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: eb4e15b0-8c32-4252-8511-bcf278fca77f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"You encountered {self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, choice.thing))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            acting_player, skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            target_player = self.opponent if acting_player == self.player else self.player
            target_creature = self.opponent_creature if acting_player == self.player else self.player_creature

            self._show_text(acting_player, f"You used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(target_player, f"Opponent used {skill.display_name}!")

            target_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            target_creature.hp = max(0, target_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0

            self._show_text(acting_player, f"You dealt {skill.damage} damage!")
            self._show_text(target_player, f"You received {skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The Resolution Phase now explicitly manages a queue for skills. Skills are added to the queue during the choice phases and processed in order during the resolution phase.

2. The `reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, ensuring that the state of all creatures (both player's and opponent's) is reset to their maximum HP.

These modifications align the implementation more closely with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the TypeError in the `_resolution_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to compare tuples with integers when sorting the turn queue. We'll modify the `_get_action_priority` method to return consistent types for all cases.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `_get_action_priority` method to always return a tuple.
2. We'll adjust the priority values to ensure proper ordering of swap actions and attack actions.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, which remain as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9aee0c38-9a47-4d27-8e96-639f3f948b37

    def _reset_creatures(self):

                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The main change is in the `_get_action_priority` method:

# Excerpt ID: 5582c49f-8c4a-4b7e-a4aa-7ad30357cdd0
```python
def _get_action_priority(self, action_tuple):
    player, action_type, _ = action_tuple
    if action_type == "swap":
        return (0, random.random())
    return (1, -player.active_creature.speed, random.random())
```

This modification ensures that:
1. Swap actions always have higher priority (lower tuple value) than attack actions.
2. For attack actions, creatures with higher speed go first (we use negative speed to sort in descending order).
3. Random tiebreakers are used for both swap and attack actions to resolve any remaining ties.

These changes should resolve the TypeError while maintaining the desired game logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

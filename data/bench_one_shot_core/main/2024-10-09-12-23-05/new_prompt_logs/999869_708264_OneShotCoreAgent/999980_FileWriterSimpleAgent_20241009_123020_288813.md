## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Remove the 'Leafeon' creature from the creature.json file, as it's not mentioned in the original architecture.
2. Replace the 'Water Gun' skill with 'Lick' in the skill.json file to match the original documentation.
3. Remove the weakness factor calculation from the MainGameScene, as it wasn't mentioned in the original architecture.

These changes will bring the implementation back in line with the original architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing:
1. The 'Leafeon' creature has been removed from the creature.json file.
2. The 'Water Gun' skill has been replaced with 'Lick' in the skill.json file.
3. The weakness factor calculation has been removed from the MainGameScene.

These modifications bring the implementation back in line with the original architecture documentation while maintaining the existing model structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

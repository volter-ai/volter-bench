## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The test for the full game flow is failing because the game is not properly ending.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the game loop to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.
2. We'll also add a check to ensure that the game ends if the random mode counter reaches zero.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e01eb639-59b9-42bf-8774-df0df1bc71fa
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        try:
            self.game_loop()
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Wrapping the `game_loop()` in a try-except block to catch the `RandomModeGracefulExit` exception and transition to the MainMenuScene when it occurs.
2. Modifying the `_check_battle_end()` method to transition to the MainMenuScene after displaying the battle result.
3. Ensuring that the game loop breaks after transitioning to the MainMenuScene, preventing the scene from continuing indefinitely.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game properly exits or transitions between scenes as expected. The changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure while addressing the specific issues raised during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

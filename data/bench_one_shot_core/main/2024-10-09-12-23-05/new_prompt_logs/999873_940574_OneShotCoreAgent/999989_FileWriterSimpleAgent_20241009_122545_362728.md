## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the test_main_game_scene.py file. The main problem is that the test is not catching the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception, which is raised when the game ends normally. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the test to catch the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception.
2. We'll add assertions to ensure that the game progresses through all battles and reaches the main menu before quitting.
3. We'll remove the BattleEnd exception and the patching of _quit_whole_game, as these are no longer necessary.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 82fdc4ea-8488-475c-9833-0f514009c207
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Increased to ensure all battles and menu interactions complete

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print("Game ended gracefully")
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
            
            # Assert that all battles were completed
            assert main_game_scene.battle_count == main_game_scene.max_battles, f"Not all battles were completed. Only {main_game_scene.battle_count} out of {main_game_scene.max_battles} were played."
            
            # Assert that the game returned to the main menu
            assert isinstance(app._current_scene, type(app.scene_registry["MainMenuScene"](app, player))), "Game did not return to the main menu after battles"
            
            # Assert that the game count in the main menu was incremented
            assert app._current_scene.game_count > 0, "Game count in main menu was not incremented"

            print(f"Run {i} completed successfully")
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. It catches the AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception, which is the expected way for the game to end.
2. It adds assertions to ensure that all battles are completed, the game returns to the main menu, and the game count is incremented.
3. It removes the unnecessary BattleEnd exception and patching of _quit_whole_game.
4. It increases the random_mode_counter to ensure all battles and menu interactions can complete before the counter reaches zero.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the test failure. The test now properly checks that the game progresses through all battles, returns to the main menu, and ends gracefully.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

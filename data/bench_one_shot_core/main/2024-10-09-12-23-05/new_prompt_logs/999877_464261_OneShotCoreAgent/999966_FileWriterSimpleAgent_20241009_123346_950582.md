## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Clearly implement the behavior where swapped-in creatures get hit by the opponent's queued skill.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll add a `_reset_battle_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot. This method will be called when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case where a creature is swapped in and immediately hit by the opponent's queued skill.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3898fb62-27e3-40f5-993e-fa831677eace

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):

        self.bot.active_creature = None
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `_reset_battle_state` method is now called in the `_end_battle` method, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset and active creatures are cleared when leaving the MainGameScene.

2. The `_resolution_phase` method now clearly implements the behavior where swapped-in creatures get hit by the opponent's queued skill. It first handles all swap actions, then processes all attack actions, ensuring that newly swapped-in creatures are the ones that receive damage from queued attacks.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

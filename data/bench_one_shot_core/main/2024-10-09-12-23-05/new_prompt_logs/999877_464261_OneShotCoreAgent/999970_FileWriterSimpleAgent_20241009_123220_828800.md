## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the MainGameScene where the game is not properly transitioning or ending after a battle concludes. The main problem is that the game loop continues indefinitely, even after a player has won or lost. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `game_loop` method in the MainGameScene to break out of the loop when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes.
3. We'll ensure that the `_check_battle_end` method returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the main issue by:

1. Modifying the `game_loop` method to break out of the loop when `_check_battle_end` returns True.
2. Adding an `_end_battle` method that shows a message and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Ensuring that `_check_battle_end` returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
4. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures after the battle (this method should be called before transitioning to the MainMenuScene).

These changes should resolve the issue of the game not ending properly after a battle concludes, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the validation error for the `active_creature` field in the `Player` class. The error occurs because the `active_creature` field is not initialized when creating a player from the prototype. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]`. This allows the field to be `None` when the player is initially created.

2. We'll update the `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both the player and the bot at the start of the battle.

Here's the updated `models.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: d9e28ae5-5c81-4c73-964b-836a919e02a8
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional, allowing it to be `None` when the player is initially created. The `MainGameScene` will be responsible for setting the `active_creature` at the start of the battle.

Now, we need to update the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle. Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 64f30579-a1b7-4289-a94c-e7cd3e8eb784
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name if player_creature else 'No active creature'}: HP {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp if player_creature else 0}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {bot_creature.display_name if bot_creature else 'No active creature'}: HP {bot_creature.hp}/{bot_creature.max_hp if bot_creature else 0}

> Attack
> Swap
"""

    def run(self):
        self._initialize_battle()
        self.game_loop()

    def _initialize_battle(self):
        if not self.player.active_creature and self.player.creatures:
            self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        if not self.bot.active_creature and self.bot.creatures:
            self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self._player_choice_phase(self.player)
            self._player_choice_phase(self.bot)
            self._resolution_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

These changes should resolve the validation error and allow the game to run properly. The `active_creature` field is now optional in the `Player` model, and the `MainGameScene` initializes it at the start of the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

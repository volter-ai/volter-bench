## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that adheres to the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issue, we'll modify the MainGameScene to explicitly implement a skill queue and remove skills from this queue during the Resolution Phase. Here's how we'll do it:

   - Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the MainGameScene class to store the queued skills.
   - Modify the player and foe choice phases to add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
   - Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queue and explicitly remove them after execution.
   - Ensure that the resolution phase continues until the skill queue is empty.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: af74d1a6-874a-42d1-93cd-cb2eba7e9cfc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List, Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Player, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

Skill queue: {', '.join(skill.display_name for _, skill in self.skill_queue)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player, choice.thing))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.bot, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            defender = self.bot if attacker == self.player else self.player
            defender_creature = self.bot_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - skill.damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {skill.damage} damage to {defender.display_name}'s creature!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, f"Dealt {skill.damage} damage to {defender.display_name}'s creature!")

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

This implementation addresses the issue by explicitly implementing a skill queue and removing skills from the queue during the Resolution Phase. The main changes are:

1. Added a `skill_queue` attribute to store the queued skills.
2. Modified `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` to add chosen skills to the queue.
3. Updated `resolution_phase` to process skills from the queue and explicitly remove them after execution.
4. Ensured that the resolution phase continues until the skill queue is empty or the battle ends.
5. Added the skill queue to the `__str__` method for better visibility of the game state.

These changes should resolve the issue while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

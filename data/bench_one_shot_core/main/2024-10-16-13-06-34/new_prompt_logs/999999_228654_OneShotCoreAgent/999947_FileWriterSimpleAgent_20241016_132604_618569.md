## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement speed-based skill execution:
   - Compare the speed of both creatures before executing skills.
   - If speeds are equal, use random order.

2. Use float arithmetic for damage calculations:
   - Perform all damage calculations using floats.
   - Convert the final damage to an integer only at the end.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: e93d349c-6603-40b6-9072-d6fcd139f337
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Implementing speed-based skill execution in the `determine_turn_order` method, which compares the speeds of both creatures and uses random order in case of a tie.

2. Using float arithmetic for damage calculations in the `execute_skill` method. All calculations are performed using floats, and the final damage is converted to an integer only at the end.

The changes maintain the existing model structure and adhere to the engine's capabilities and architecture. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

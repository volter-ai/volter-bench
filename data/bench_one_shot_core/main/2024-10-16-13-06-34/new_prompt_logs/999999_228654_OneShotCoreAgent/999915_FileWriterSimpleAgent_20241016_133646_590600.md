## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the player's creatures' states after a battle ends, we need to modify the MainGameScene. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value after the battle concludes. This aligns with the architecture requirements and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. Add a new method `_reset_creatures` to the MainGameScene class.
2. Call this method after the battle ends, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The `_reset_creatures` method will reset the HP of both the player's and opponent's creatures to their max_hp.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 9b10ea9d-d31a-4576-b4a2-fe4752e199af
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            self.battle_ended = self._check_battle_end()

        # Reset creatures' states after the battle ends
        self._reset_creatures()

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_raw_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            return attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            return (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        weakness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return weakness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding the `_reset_creatures` method, which resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value after the battle ends. The method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset for future battles.

This solution maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic, as the resetting logic is handled within the scene rather than in the model classes. It also aligns with the architecture requirements by resetting the state of the player's creatures after a battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

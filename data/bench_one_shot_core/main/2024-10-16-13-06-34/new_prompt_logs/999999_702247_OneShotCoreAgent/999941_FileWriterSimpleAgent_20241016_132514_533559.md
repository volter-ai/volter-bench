## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of missing logic for random order execution when creatures have the same speed in the resolution phase.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll implement the solution:

   - Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - Implement the skill execution based on the determined order.

2. I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution. This change doesn't require any modifications to the models, as it only affects the game logic within the scene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 397c379c-2f91-4bc6-bf46-cd7fa90f04ae
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skills(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skills(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skills(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
            else:
                self.execute_skills(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

    def execute_skills(self, first_player, first_creature, first_skill, second_player, second_creature, second_skill):
        self.execute_skill(first_player, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second_player, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding logic for random order execution when creatures have the same speed in the resolution phase. The `resolution_phase` method now compares the speeds of the creatures and uses `random.choice()` to determine the order when speeds are equal. The `execute_skills` method has been added to handle the execution of skills in the determined order.

These changes ensure that the game now correctly handles situations where creatures have the same speed, adding an element of randomness to the turn order in such cases.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

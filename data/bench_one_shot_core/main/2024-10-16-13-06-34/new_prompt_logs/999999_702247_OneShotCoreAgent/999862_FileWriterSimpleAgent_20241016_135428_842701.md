## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix the two discrepancies:

1. Implement random order for creatures with equal speed during the resolution phase:
   - We'll modify the `_resolve_turn` method to use a random tiebreaker when creatures have equal speed.

2. Ensure the swapped-in creature gets hit by the opponent's queued skill:
   - We'll update the `_resolve_turn` method to handle swaps before attacks, and apply any queued attacks to the newly swapped-in creature.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised during QA/testing:

1. Random order for creatures with equal speed:
   - In the `_resolve_turn` method, we've added `random.random()` as a third key in the sorting function. This ensures that when creatures have equal speed, their order will be randomized.

2. Swapped-in creature gets hit by opponent's queued skill:
   - We've modified the `_resolve_turn` method to handle all swaps first, then handle all attacks. This ensures that if a creature is swapped in, it will be the target of any queued attacks.

These changes maintain the required architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The game logic remains contained within the scene, and the models remain pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

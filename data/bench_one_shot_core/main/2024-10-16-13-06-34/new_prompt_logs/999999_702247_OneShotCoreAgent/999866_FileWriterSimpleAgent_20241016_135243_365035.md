## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing forced swap logic when a creature is knocked out, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a new method `_check_and_force_swap` that will be called after each attack.
2. This method will check if the active creature of either player has been knocked out (HP <= 0).
3. If a creature is knocked out, it will force the player to swap to another creature with HP > 0.
4. If the player has no more creatures with HP > 0, the battle will end.
5. We'll update the `_resolve_turn` method to call `_check_and_force_swap` after each attack.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This updated `main_game_scene.py` file includes the new `_check_and_force_swap` method and modifies the `_resolve_turn` method to implement the forced swap logic when a creature is knocked out. The changes ensure that:

1. After each attack, the game checks if either player's active creature has been knocked out.
2. If a creature is knocked out, the player is forced to swap to another creature with HP > 0.
3. If the player has no more creatures with HP > 0, the battle ends.

These changes address the issue raised during QA/testing while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The game logic remains contained within the scene, and the models remain pure data schemas.

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes:

1. Implement a method to reset the player's creatures' state after the battle ends.
2. Adjust the skill resolution to more closely align with the described architecture.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method in the `MainGameScene` class. This method will reset the HP of both the player's and the foe's creatures to their maximum HP after the battle ends.

2. We'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to resolve skills one at a time, as described in the architecture. This means we'll first resolve the player's skill, check for battle end, and then resolve the foe's skill if the battle hasn't ended.

3. We'll call the `reset_creatures` method before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

Here's the rewritten `MainGameScene` with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 01b4191d-54d7-4afe-93c5-605608b60af8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            battle_ended = self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if battle_ended:
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        # Resolve player's skill
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp = max(0, self.foe_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.check_battle_end():
            return True

        # Resolve foe's skill
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - foe_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

        return self.check_battle_end()

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of both the player's and the foe's creatures after the battle ends.
2. Modifying the `resolution_phase` to resolve skills one at a time, checking for battle end after each skill resolution.
3. Calling the `reset_creatures` method before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

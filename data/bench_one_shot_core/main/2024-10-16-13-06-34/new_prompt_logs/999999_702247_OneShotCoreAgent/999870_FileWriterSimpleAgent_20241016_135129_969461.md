## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError in the MainGameScene class. The error occurs because the method `_player_turn` is missing. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add the `_player_turn` method to the MainGameScene class.
2. We'll ensure that all the necessary methods for the game logic are present in the MainGameScene class.
3. We'll review and update the game loop to make sure it follows the correct sequence of actions.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This updated `main_game_scene.py` file includes the missing `_player_turn` method and ensures that all necessary methods for the game logic are present. The game loop in the `run` method now correctly calls `_player_turn` for both the player and the opponent, followed by resolving the turn and checking for the battle end condition.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining the required architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The game logic is contained within the scene, and the models remain pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

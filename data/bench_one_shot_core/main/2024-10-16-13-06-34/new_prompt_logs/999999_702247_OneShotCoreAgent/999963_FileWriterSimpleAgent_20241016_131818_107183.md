## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method to return to the main menu when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a check after the battle loop to transition back to the main menu.
3. We'll ensure that the `_check_battle_end` method returns a boolean value.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2ff9780d-47fa-449c-bd0e-ef40b808d371
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` properly transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. The `run` method now includes a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the battle loop, which will correctly exit the scene and transition to the main menu.

The `_check_battle_end` method now explicitly returns a boolean value, which is used in the `battle_loop` to determine when to exit the loop.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected, transitioning between scenes properly and avoiding the antipattern of returning directly from the scene's game loop.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

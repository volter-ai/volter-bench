## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop to break and transition when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle, so the game can be played multiple times.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: f73a2b7c-5e2a-4dbb-867f-4a35b90be32d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{self._get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, opponent: Player, creature: Creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

        for attacker, attacker_creature, skill in [first, second]:
            if attacker == self.player:
                defender, defender_creature = self.opponent, self.opponent_creature
            else:
                defender, defender_creature = self.player, self.player_creature

            damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

            if defender_creature.hp == 0:
                break

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends in the `game_loop` method.
2. Breaking the game loop when the battle ends.
3. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after each battle.

These modifications ensure that the scene exits properly and allows for multiple playthroughs without needing to restart the entire application. The game will now transition back to the main menu after each battle, allowing the player to start a new battle or quit the game.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

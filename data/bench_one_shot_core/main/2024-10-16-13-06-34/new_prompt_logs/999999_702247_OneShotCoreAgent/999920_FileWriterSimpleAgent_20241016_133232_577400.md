## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll present the player with options to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. In `handle_battle_end`, we present the player with options to play again or quit.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game using the appropriate methods.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve the issues raised in the QA/testing phase and make the game flow more robust.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner in the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends, we'll add a prompt for the player to choose between playing again or quitting the game.
2. We'll implement the logic to either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game based on the player's choice.

Here's how we'll modify the MainGameScene to implement these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ef8ae55e-c090-4fac-b155-acfaf2d995e9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_game_prompt()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_game_prompt(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "What would you like to do next?")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_game_prompt` method that is called after the battle ends.
2. Providing the player with options to play again or quit the game.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to return to the MainMenuScene if the player chooses to play again.
4. Using `_quit_whole_game` to exit the game if the player chooses to quit.

These modifications ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. This should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting in an expected manner in the random run test and the problem of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

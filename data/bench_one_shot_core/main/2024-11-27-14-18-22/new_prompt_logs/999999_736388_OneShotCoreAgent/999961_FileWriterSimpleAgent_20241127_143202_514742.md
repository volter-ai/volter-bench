Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Analysis:

I need to fix two issues in MainGameScene:

a) Random order for equal speed:
- In resolve_turn(), after sorting by speed, I'll check if speeds are equal
- If equal, randomly shuffle the order of those actions

b) Forced swapping for knocked out creatures:
- After each skill execution, check if the target creature was knocked out (hp = 0)
- If knocked out, force the owner to swap to an available creature
- If no creatures available, proceed to battle end check
- Add a force_swap() method to handle this logic

The changes will be contained in MainGameScene since they're game logic, not model changes.

2. Here's the complete fixed implementation:

```

Key changes:
1. Added force_swap() method to handle knocked out creatures
2. Modified resolve_turn() to:
   - Check for equal speeds and randomize order if equal
   - Check for knocked out creatures after each skill execution
   - Force swap when needed
3. All changes maintain separation of concerns - game logic stays in scene, models remain pure data schemas

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

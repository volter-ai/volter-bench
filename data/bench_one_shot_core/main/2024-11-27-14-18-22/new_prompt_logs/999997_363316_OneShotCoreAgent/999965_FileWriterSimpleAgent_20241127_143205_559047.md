Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue of not resetting creature state when leaving the MainGameScene.

The solution:
1. According to the docs, we need to "reset the state of the player's creatures" when leaving the scene
2. This means resetting HP back to max_hp for all creatures
3. This should happen before transitioning away from MainGameScene
4. Since models can't have methods, this logic must be in the scene
5. We'll add this reset before any scene exit

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Added reset_creatures_state() method to reset HP and clear active_creature
2. Called reset_creatures_state() before exiting the scene in check_battle_end()
3. This ensures creatures are reset to their original state when leaving the scene
4. No changes needed to models.py since this is scene logic

This maintains the architecture guidelines while fixing the missing reset functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

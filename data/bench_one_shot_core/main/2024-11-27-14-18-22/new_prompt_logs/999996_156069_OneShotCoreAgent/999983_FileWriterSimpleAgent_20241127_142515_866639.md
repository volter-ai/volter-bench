Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene doesn't properly exit - it needs to either transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Currently, it just breaks from the loop without calling either exit method.

Looking at the game architecture, when a battle ends (win or lose), we should return to the main menu or quit the game. Since this is a simple game, returning to the main menu makes the most sense.

I'll fix the MainGameScene by adding a proper exit after the battle ends:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. After checking for battle end and showing the win/lose message, we now show a "Returning to main menu..." message
2. We call `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to properly exit the scene
3. We return from the run method after transitioning to prevent any further execution

This follows the engine's requirements that scenes must explicitly transition or quit, and maintains the game flow by returning players to the main menu after a battle ends. The rest of the architecture (models, other scenes, etc.) remains unchanged since this was purely a scene flow issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

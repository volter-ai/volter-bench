Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not catching the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in the test. According to the engine's architecture, when a scene ends with `_quit_whole_game()`, it raises this exception which should be caught. Looking at the other test files that pass, they handle this exception properly.

The fix:
We need to modify the test file to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exceptions, as both are valid ways for the test to end. This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the scene's functionality.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 26b9b8c0-7694-461a-9f12-8eff8a37ac9b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully. Ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` from the engine lib
2. Added exception handling for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added print statement to show when game ends gracefully

This maintains the same test functionality while properly handling the engine's scene exit mechanism. The test will now pass while still verifying that the MainGameScene works correctly through random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is returning directly when the battle ends instead of properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

The fix:
When the battle ends (either through a win or loss), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` since this is the final scene. This follows the engine's requirements and maintains proper scene lifecycle management.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` before returning in the run method when:
   - Player action is None (all creatures knocked out)
   - Opponent action is None (all creatures knocked out) 
   - Battle end check returns True (winner determined)

This ensures the scene always ends properly according to the engine's requirements while maintaining the same game functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference self.player_action which doesn't exist. The issue is that we're trying to compare the current action with self.player_action to determine the attacker, but we never stored which action belongs to which player.

The fix:
Instead of trying to compare the entire action tuple, we should pass both the action and the player who performed it to execute_action. This way we can directly determine who the attacker and defender are. This maintains separation of concerns and stays within the engine's capabilities.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Changed resolve_actions to take tuples of (player, action) instead of just actions
2. Modified get_action_order to handle these tuples
3. Changed execute_action to take the acting player and action separately
4. Removed the problematic comparison of actions and instead use direct player references

This maintains the same functionality while fixing the error in a way that's consistent with the engine's architecture and keeps the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

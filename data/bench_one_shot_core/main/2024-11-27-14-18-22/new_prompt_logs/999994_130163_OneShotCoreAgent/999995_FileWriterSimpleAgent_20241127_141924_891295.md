Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is a NameError because 'uuid' is not defined in main.py. This is a simple import issue - we need to import the uuid module at the top of main.py. Looking at the original main.py, we can see the uuid import was accidentally omitted.

2. Solution:
I'll rewrite main.py with the missing import. The rest of the file remains unchanged since it was working correctly otherwise.

# Excerpt ID: 23cddffa-e9bc-44a0-aa80-46cc0dc7f52b
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

This fix:
1. Maintains all architectural requirements
2. Doesn't modify any models
3. Keeps the engine capabilities intact
4. Just adds the missing import that was causing the error
5. Should resolve both test failures since they were both caused by the same missing import

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is trying to call `reset()` on the Player object, but we removed that method to keep models as pure data schemas. Instead of using methods on models, we should handle the reset logic directly in the scene.

The fix involves:
- Remove the `reset()` calls in MainGameScene
- Move the creature HP reset logic directly into the initialization code
- Keep all game logic in the scene while maintaining models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                self.bot.active_creature = random.choice(available)

```

The key change is in the `__init__` method where we now handle the creature HP reset directly instead of calling a method on the Player model. This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while fixing the error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods or properties. The reset functionality should be moved to the scenes where the game logic belongs.

The fix involves:
1. Remove all methods from models.py
2. Move the reset logic to MainGameScene where it's actually used
3. Keep models as pure data schemas with just attributes
4. Handle creature HP reset directly in the MainGameScene initialization

2. Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 0797827b-e19b-4a96-90b1-1df96bcb6662
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int 
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The MainGameScene will need to handle resetting creature HP in its initialization. The relevant part of MainGameScene's __init__ would look like:

# Excerpt ID: 9138993b-24e5-4701-9b24-11612dc462a4
```python
def __init__(self, app, player):
    super().__init__(app, player)
    self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
    
    # Reset creatures HP to max_hp
    for creature in self.player.creatures:
        creature.hp = creature.max_hp
    for creature in self.bot.creatures:
        creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        
    # Set initial active creatures
    self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
    self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
```

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while preserving the same functionality. The models are now pure data schemas as required by the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods or properties. The solution is to:

1. Remove all methods from the models
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp value directly in the scene when needed

This follows the architecture principle that all game logic should be in scenes, while models are just data containers.

2. Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: ef1410ae-2f98-49c7-b294-43f1415de6d4
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  # fire, water, etc
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str  # fire, water, etc
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The MainGameScene will need to handle resetting creatures by directly setting hp = max_hp. I'll modify the scene initialization to:

# Excerpt ID: 328624f3-0f67-4d6d-a7b5-861b4ade7f15
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures by setting hp directly
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
```

This keeps the models as pure data schemas while maintaining the same functionality in the scene where the game logic belongs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

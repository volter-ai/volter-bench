Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

Instead, I should:
- Remove the reset() method from Creature model
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- In MainGameScene, simply set hp back to max_hp directly

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: 721bc2fe-bb05-431e-bccd-7d7a44d0965c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int 
    max_hp: int
    skills: List[Skill]

    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "A challenger approaches!")

        while True:
            # Player phase
            skill_buttons = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_buttons)
            player_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills 
                              if s.display_name == player_choice.display_name)
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self.bot_creature.skills[0]  # Bot always uses first skill
            self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, [Button(bot_skill.display_name)])

            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
                break

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. In MainGameScene, replaced creature.reset() calls with direct hp assignment
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while following the architectural constraints of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling creature.reset(), we'll directly set the hp back to max_hp in the scene

This maintains separation between data (models) and logic (scenes).

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: 0da072f5-1559-425b-8b0e-bb073ed9b12b
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

And the corresponding scene change (though you didn't ask for it, I'll show where the reset logic moved to):

# Excerpt ID: 08da19a5-b39f-491c-9bc2-820a42d158ce
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
# ... rest of the file stays the same ...

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle Start! {self.player_creature.display_name} vs {self.opponent_creature.display_name}")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )
            
            # Execute moves
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
                
            self._execute_skill(*second)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving - moved from model to scene
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is removing the method from the model and moving the reset logic directly into the scene. This maintains proper separation between data and logic while keeping the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

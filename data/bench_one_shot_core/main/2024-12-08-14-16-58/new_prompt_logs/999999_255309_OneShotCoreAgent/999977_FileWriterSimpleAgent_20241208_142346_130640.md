Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that we're not resetting creature states when leaving the MainGameScene. According to the architecture docs:
> "When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

To fix this, we need to:
1. Store the initial max_hp as the reset point for each creature
2. Add a reset method in MainGameScene that restores all creatures' HP to their max_hp before quitting
3. Call this reset before any scene exit

The reset should happen in the scene, not in the models, since models should be pure data schemas.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added `reset_creatures_state()` method to restore creatures to initial state
2. Called `reset_creatures_state()` before quitting the game
3. Reset both player and bot creatures to maintain consistency

This ensures creatures are restored to their initial state when leaving the scene, as required by the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

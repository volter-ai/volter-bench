Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without any methods or properties. The reset functionality should be moved to the scene where the game logic belongs.

The fix involves:
1. Remove all methods from models.py classes
2. Move the reset logic to MainGameScene
3. Keep models as pure data schemas with just fields
4. Handle all creature and player state management in the scene

2. Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 0177335c-2ab5-42e4-af26-c07a1a30d5ad
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The MainGameScene will now handle resetting creature HP and active creature state in its initialization. This keeps the models as pure data schemas while maintaining the same functionality.

Would you like me to show the updated MainGameScene as well to see how the reset logic is handled there?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

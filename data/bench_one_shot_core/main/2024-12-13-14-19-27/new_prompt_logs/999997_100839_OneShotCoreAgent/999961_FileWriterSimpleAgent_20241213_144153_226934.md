Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the error message and engine architecture:
- Scenes must always end with either `_transition_to_scene()` or `_quit_whole_game()`
- Breaking or returning from the game loop is an antipattern
- After a battle ends, we should either return to the main menu or quit the game

Solution:
- After the battle ends (win or lose), we'll transition back to MainMenuScene
- This maintains the game flow and follows the engine's requirements
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the run() method where we now properly transition back to MainMenuScene after a battle ends, rather than just breaking from the loop. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must always end with a transition or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

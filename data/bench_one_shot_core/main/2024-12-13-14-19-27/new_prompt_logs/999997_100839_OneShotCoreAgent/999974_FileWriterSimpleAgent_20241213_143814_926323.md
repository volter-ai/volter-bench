Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because `_quit_whole_game()` raises an exception that needs to be caught in the test. The test currently only catches `TransitionFromScene` and `RandomModeGracefulExit`, but needs to also catch `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`. This is a test framework issue, not a game logic issue.

The fix is to modify the test file to catch the quit game exception. This maintains all architectural requirements since:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Scene logic remains intact
- We're just improving test coverage of expected exceptions

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ee676a3e-269f-440c-b258-1ee783bdae3e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"exiting via random mode counter")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting via game quit")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import of `AbstractApp` from engine lib
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added print statement for quit game exit path

This maintains all architectural requirements while properly handling the expected game quit exception in the test framework.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The errors show that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's just breaking from its loop without transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the game when the battle is over by calling `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the battle result. This maintains the engine's scene flow requirements while keeping our models as pure data schemas.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Moved the win condition check into the main run loop
2. Added `_quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends
3. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end()` method since the logic is now directly in the run loop
4. Removed the break statement that was causing the scene to end improperly

This ensures the scene always ends properly through the engine's expected methods while maintaining all other architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

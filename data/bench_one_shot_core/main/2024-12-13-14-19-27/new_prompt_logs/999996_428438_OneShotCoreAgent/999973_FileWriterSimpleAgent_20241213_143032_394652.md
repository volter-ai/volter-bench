Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to use Player objects (which inherit from AbstractThing) as dictionary keys in `self.queued_skills`. The error message suggests we should use the prototype_id instead.

The solution is to:
- Change the queued_skills dictionary to use player.uid instead of the player object as the key
- This follows the engine's design where we should use IDs rather than Thing objects for lookups/keys
- This maintains the pure data model approach while fixing the hashability issue

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 6b0ea42d-a875-4ef0-8452-0066b2eb1e67

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        effectiveness = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness_map = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2.0,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2.0,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2.0,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        
        return effectiveness_map.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.player]` to `self.queued_skills[self.player.uid]`
2. Changed `self.queued_skills[self.opponent]` to `self.queued_skills[self.opponent.uid]`
3. Updated resolution phase to use `attacker.uid` when accessing queued_skills

This maintains the same functionality while properly using IDs instead of Thing objects as dictionary keys.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

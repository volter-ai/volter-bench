Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply assign max_hp to hp directly in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the fixed files:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Changed the reset logic in MainGameScene to directly set hp = max_hp
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while properly separating data models from game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

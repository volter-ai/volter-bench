Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're getting an empty choices list when trying to swap creatures. This happens because we're filtering out all creatures when either:
1. All creatures are knocked out (which should trigger game end)
2. The only remaining creature is the active one (which means we shouldn't offer swap at all)

The fix should:
1. Check if there are valid swap options BEFORE offering the swap choice
2. Handle the case where all creatures are knocked out by checking for game end BEFORE getting player actions
3. Only show "Swap" as an option if there are valid creatures to swap to

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_swap_creatures` helper to centralize swap creature filtering logic
2. Modified `get_player_action` to only show swap option if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Moved battle end check to start of turn loop
4. Separated forced swap logic into `handle_forced_swap` method
5. Added forced swap checks before getting actions

This should prevent the empty choices list error while maintaining all game mechanics within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

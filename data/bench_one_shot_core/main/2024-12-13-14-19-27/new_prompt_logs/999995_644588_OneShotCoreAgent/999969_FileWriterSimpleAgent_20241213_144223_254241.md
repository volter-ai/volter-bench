Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The fix is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling creature.reset(), we'll directly set hp = max_hp in the scene

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into the MainGameScene's run method
3. Kept models as pure data schemas with only attributes

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while preserving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

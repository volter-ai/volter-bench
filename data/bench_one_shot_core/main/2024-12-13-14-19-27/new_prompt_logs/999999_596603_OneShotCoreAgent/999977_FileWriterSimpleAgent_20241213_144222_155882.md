Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because `uuid` is not imported in main.py. Looking at the engine's lib.py, we can see it already has uuid imported and provides a `make_uuid()` helper function. We should use this instead of directly using uuid.

The fix is simple:
1. Import `make_uuid` from the engine lib
2. Use `make_uuid()` instead of `str(uuid.uuid4())`

2. Here's the fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: bd6198be-a2d6-4dc1-a8ff-d73141fee0cb
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, make_uuid
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = make_uuid()
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed direct uuid import
2. Added import of make_uuid from engine lib
3. Replaced str(uuid.uuid4()) with make_uuid()

This maintains the same functionality while using the engine's provided utilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

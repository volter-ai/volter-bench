Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to use `uuid` in main.py without importing it. The fix is simple - we just need to add the import statement at the top of main.py.

2. Here's the corrected main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 42b3fd7c-948a-4a8b-b421-f3512fef755d
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

This fix:
1. Adds the missing uuid import
2. Maintains all the existing functionality
3. Keeps within the engine's capabilities
4. Doesn't affect the model architecture
5. Preserves the pure data schema nature of the models

The error was simply a missing import, and this solution addresses it directly without requiring any architectural changes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

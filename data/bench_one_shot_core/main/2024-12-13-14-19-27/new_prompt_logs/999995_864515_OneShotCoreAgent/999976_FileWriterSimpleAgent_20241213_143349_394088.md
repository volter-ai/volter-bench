Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods. The reset functionality should be moved to the scene where the game logic belongs.

Solution:
- Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
- Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene
- Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` in the scene

2. Here's the corrected models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: b0b61880-2a4b-4e3a-b767-3fc75b8a1a72
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

The MainGameScene will handle resetting HP directly in its code by setting `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` where needed. This keeps the models as pure data schemas and moves all logic to the scenes where it belongs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

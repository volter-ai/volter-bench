Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're giving the bot the player's skill choices instead of its own creature's skills. This causes a StopIteration when trying to find the chosen skill in the bot's creature's skills.

The fix is simple: we need to give the bot its own creature's skills as choices instead of the player's skills.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            # Determine order
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.bot_creature.speed:
                first, second = self.player_creature, self.bot_creature

                first, second = self.bot_creature, self.player_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = bot_skill, player_skill
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first, second = self.player_creature, self.bot_creature
                    first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, bot_skill
                else:
                    first, second = self.bot_creature, self.player_creature
                    first_skill, second_skill = bot_skill, player_skill

            # Resolution phase
            battle_ended = self._execute_turn(first, second, first_skill, second_skill)

            if battle_ended:
                if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key change is in the run() method where I:
1. Renamed skill_choices to player_skill_choices for clarity
2. Added bot_skill_choices that uses the bot's creature's skills instead of the player's
3. Used bot_skill_choices when getting the bot's choice

This ensures the bot is choosing from its own available skills rather than trying to use the player's skills. The rest of the battle logic remains unchanged since it was working correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

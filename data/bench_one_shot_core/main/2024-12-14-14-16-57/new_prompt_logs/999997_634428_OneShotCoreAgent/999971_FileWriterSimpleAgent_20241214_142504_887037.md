Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py - we need to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. This is expected behavior when the game ends and quit is chosen in random mode. The test should:
- Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
- Consider both as valid ways for the random test to end
- Not fail the test when these expected exceptions occur

This maintains:
- Models as pure data schemas
- Game logic in scenes
- Proper engine exception handling
- Random mode testing capabilities

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5061662b-4e18-41aa-bf67-975ef4004a64
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} ended gracefully with: {str(e)}")
            except Exception as e:
                raise  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Import AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Print informative message about graceful exit
4. Re-raise any unexpected exceptions

This allows the test to handle both ways the random mode can end gracefully while still catching actual errors.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

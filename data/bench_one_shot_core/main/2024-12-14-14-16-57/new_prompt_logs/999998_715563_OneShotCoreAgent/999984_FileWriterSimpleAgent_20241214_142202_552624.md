Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help fix this issue.

1. The problem is that I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. Instead, we should move this logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs. We'll modify both the models.py to remove the method and update the MainGameScene to handle resetting creature HP.

2. Here are the fixed files:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from the Creature model since models must be pure data schemas
2. Moved the reset logic directly into the MainGameScene where we simply set hp back to max_hp
3. Kept all other functionality the same, just reorganized where the logic lives

This maintains the pure data model requirement while preserving all the game functionality. The models now only define the structure of the data, while all logic lives in the scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in MainGameScene's _execute_action method. It's trying to reference self.player_action and self.bot_action which don't exist. The problem is that we're trying to determine which player made the action by comparing the entire action dictionary, which is incorrect.

Instead, we should store the player_action and bot_action as class attributes when we receive them in the run() method, and then pass the attacker directly to _execute_action. This maintains clean separation of concerns and fixes the attribute error.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed references to self.player_action and self.bot_action
2. Modified _resolve_actions to take both actions and actors
3. Modified _execute_action to take the attacker directly
4. Updated _determine_action_order to return both actions and actors
5. Updated the run() method to properly pass actors along with their actions

This maintains clean separation of concerns while fixing the attribute error, and stays within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

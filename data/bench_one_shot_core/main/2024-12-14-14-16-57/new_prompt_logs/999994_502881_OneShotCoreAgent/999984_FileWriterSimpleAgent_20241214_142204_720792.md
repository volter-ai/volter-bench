Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help fix this issue. 

1. The problem is that I added a `reset()` method to the Creature class in `models.py`, but the models must be pure data schemas without any methods. The solution is to:

- Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature class
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- Update the hp directly in the scene when we need to reset it
- Use the max_hp value that's already stored in the Creature model

2. Here's the fixed `models.py` file with the method removed:

# Excerpt ID: 10e95012-4b13-445f-b777-f792c83115b6
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  # normal, fire, water, leaf
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str  # normal, fire, water, leaf
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And in the MainGameScene, we'll need to modify the reset logic to directly set hp = max_hp:

# Excerpt ID: 74e196fc-d238-449f-a0dd-17e379020174

        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        first, second = self._determine_order(

    def _check_battle_end(self):

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from the Creature class in models.py
2. Modified the reset logic in MainGameScene to directly set hp = max_hp instead of calling a method
3. Kept all the game logic in the scene where it belongs

This maintains the separation between pure data models and game logic while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

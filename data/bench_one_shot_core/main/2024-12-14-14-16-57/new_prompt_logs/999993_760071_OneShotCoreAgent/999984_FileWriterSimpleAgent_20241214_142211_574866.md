Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help fix this issue. 

1. The problem is that the Creature class has a `reset()` method, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. The error message specifically states: "Creature is a pure data model and methods like reset cannot be added to it. All logic should be implemented in scenes"

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene when needed

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: d21f39cf-c7ac-4ab9-ac4a-ddeae4242fd5
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  # normal, fire, water, leaf
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str  # normal, fire, water, leaf
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And the corresponding change in MainGameScene (just the relevant part where reset was called):

# Excerpt ID: c4b27b3f-306e-435b-8154-0866d169d5f7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
# ... rest of the file stays the same ...

                    winner = self.player if defender_creature == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                    self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                    
                    # Reset creatures before leaving
                    self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                    self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
                    
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return

# ... rest of the file stays the same ...
```

This change:
1. Keeps models as pure data schemas
2. Moves all logic to scenes where it belongs
3. Maintains the same functionality
4. Follows the engine's architecture requirements

The fix is minimal and focused on the specific issue raised by the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead, the reset logic should be moved to the MainGameScene. We'll:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Add the reset logic directly in MainGameScene's __init__ where we set up the creatures
3. Create a helper function in MainGameScene to handle resetting HP to max_hp

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

# Excerpt ID: 74256f46-f986-44fc-9cf1-75d282bce4c2
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot Choice Phase  
            bot_skill = self.get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage

            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") 
                return

    def get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills
        ]
        for choice, skill in zip(choices, creature.skills):
            choice.value = {"skill": skill}
            
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).value["skill"]
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into MainGameScene's __init__
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while following the architectural requirements of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

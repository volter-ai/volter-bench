Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help create this creature battler game. Let me plan out the implementation:

1. First, we need to create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (with type, physical/special, damage)
- Creature (with stats, type, skills)
- Player (with creatures)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json (with skill prototypes)
- creature.json (with creature prototypes) 
- player.json (with player prototypes)

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating)
- MainGameScene (for the battle logic)

4. Create corresponding tests for each scene

Let me implement each file:

This implementation:
1. Follows the model guidelines by making pure data schemas
2. Uses proper inheritance from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
3. References other models directly without string IDs
4. Implements the battle mechanics as specified
5. Uses proper scene transitions
6. Includes random testing for scenes
7. Shows all relevant information in scene __str__ methods
8. Creates models using from_prototype_id
9. Treats bots the same as players
10. Follows the folder structure

The game allows players to:
1. Start from a main menu
2. Enter a battle with a bot
3. Take turns using skills
4. Have damage calculated based on stats and type effectiveness
5. Win or lose based on HP reaching zero
6. Return to main menu after battle

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

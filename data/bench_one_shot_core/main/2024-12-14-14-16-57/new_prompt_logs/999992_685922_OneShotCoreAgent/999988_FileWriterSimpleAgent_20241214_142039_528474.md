Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine architecture, every scene must end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: In MainGameScene, after a battle ends, we should transition back to MainMenuScene so the player can play again or quit. This maintains proper scene flow control as required by the engine.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 0e66b42c-12d4-4aab-b347-386fe72f9ed2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase

        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        p1, c1, _ = action1

        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)

            f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
            f"Dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} has been defeated!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} is victorious!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` when the battle ends
2. Added `return` statements after the transitions to ensure the scene properly exits
3. Kept all the same battle logic but now with proper scene flow control

This maintains the engine's architecture requirements while fixing the scene transition issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

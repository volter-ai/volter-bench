Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The error occurs because we're trying to use Creature objects (which inherit from AbstractThing) as dictionary keys in `self.queued_skills`. According to the error message and engine guidelines, we should use the prototype_id instead of the object itself as a key.

The fix needs to be in main_game_scene.py where we're storing the queued skills. Instead of:
# Excerpt ID: 94028281-9364-4d7d-9402-3779beaf8c5d
```python
self.queued_skills[self.player_creature] = selected_skill
```
We should use:
# Excerpt ID: ec3bf896-9d6a-4b61-b494-e74f59631df1
```python
self.queued_skills[self.player_creature.prototype_id] = selected_skill
```

This follows the engine's design where AbstractThings shouldn't be used as dictionary keys. We'll need to modify the execute_turn method as well to use the prototype_ids when accessing the queued skills.

2. Here's the fixed main_game_scene.py:

# Excerpt ID: 98720047-68a3-484c-9bc2-17b45243c5b1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Calculate raw damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0

            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def execute_turn(self):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

        # Execute skills
        for attacker in [first, second]:
            defender = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
            skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.prototype_id]
            
            damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
            defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
            selected_skill = next(s for s in self.player_creature.skills if s.display_name == choice.display_name)
            self.queued_skills[self.player_creature.prototype_id] = selected_skill

            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature.skills)
            self.queued_skills[self.opponent_creature.prototype_id] = bot_skill

            # Execute turn
            self.execute_turn()

            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The changes:
1. Changed dictionary keys from Creature objects to their prototype_ids
2. Updated execute_turn to use prototype_ids when accessing queued_skills
3. Maintained all existing game logic and functionality
4. Stayed within engine capabilities
5. Kept models as pure data schemas
6. Preserved proper inheritance structure

This fix should resolve the FixableException while maintaining the intended game mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

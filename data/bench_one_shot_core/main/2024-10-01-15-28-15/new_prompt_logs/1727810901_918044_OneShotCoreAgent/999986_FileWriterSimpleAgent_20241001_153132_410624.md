Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is not properly transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends. This is causing the scene to terminate without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is an antipattern in our game engine.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends, instead of just returning.
2. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, but not transition directly.
3. We'll ensure that the scene transitions properly after reaching the maximum number of turns as well.

These changes will ensure that the game flow is maintained and scenes transition correctly.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.turn_count = 0
        self._reset_creatures()

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp

            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        if self.turn_count >= self.MAX_TURNS:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Maximum turns reached. The battle ends in a draw!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "Maximum turns reached. The battle ends in a draw!")

        # Always transition back to MainMenuScene after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if not self._check_battle_end():
                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
                if not self._check_battle_end():
                    self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The MainGameScene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends, whether it's due to a creature's HP reaching 0 or the maximum number of turns being reached.
2. The `_check_battle_end` method now only returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, without directly transitioning to another scene.
3. The main game loop in the `run` method now handles the transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes.

These modifications should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the game flow is maintained correctly within the capabilities of the engine and the existing architecture.

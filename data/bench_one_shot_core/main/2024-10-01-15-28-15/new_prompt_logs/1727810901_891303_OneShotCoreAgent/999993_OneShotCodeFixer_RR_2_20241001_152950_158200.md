You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Players** manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creatures** are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```
The calculated damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's resistance to damage against attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" | Has a bubwool
- "Basic Opponent" | Has a scizard

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | 10 hp | 3 attack | 2 defense | 4 speed | Skills: tackle
- "Scizard" | 11 hp | 3 attack | 3 defense | 3 speed | Skills: tackle

```

Use the engine above to create a game based on the architecture markdowns 

The folder structure should be as follows:
- mini_game_engine
  - engine
    - lib.py (this is already implemented)

- main_game (all your files should be written here)
  - content
    - {model name}.json
  - scenes
    - {scene name}.py
  - tests
    - test_{scene name}.py
  - models.py
  - main.py (the entrypoint)

Relevant existing files (that you should rewrite if needed):
```python main_game/main.py
class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```
```python main_game/models.py
class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"


T = TypeVar('T', bound='AbstractThing')

def create_from_game_database(game_thing_prototype_id: str, game_thing_class: type[T]) -> T:
    """Takes in a prototype_id and uses the content JSON files to bootstrap a hydrated game entity"""
    return game_thing_class.from_prototype_id(game_thing_prototype_id)

```



Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation and then write the necessary files for the creature battler game.

Detailed Plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations
   - Define Skill, Creature, and Player models inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
   - Ensure models are in strict dependency order
   - Use direct references to other model types, not string IDs or forward references

2. Create JSON content files:
   - `main_game/content/skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `main_game/content/creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `main_game/content/player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Implement `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Create MainMenuScene class inheriting from AbstractGameScene
   - Implement run method with logic for playing or quitting
   - Implement __str__ method to display scene information

4. Implement `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Create MainGameScene class inheriting from AbstractGameScene
   - Implement run method with battle logic (player choice, foe choice, resolution phases)
   - Implement __str__ method to display all relevant battle information
   - Use create_bot for creating the opponent

5. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`: Test MainMenuScene
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`: Test MainGameScene
   - Use HumanListener's random mode to make 10 random choices

6. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register MainGameScene in the App class
   - Ensure proper scene transitions

Now, I'll write out each file according to this plan.

These files implement the creature battler game according to the provided specifications and guidelines. The game includes a main menu scene and a main game scene where players can battle against a bot opponent using their creatures and skills. The implementation follows the model-view-controller pattern, separates concerns between models and scenes, and includes basic test cases for both scenes.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The opponent's listener is not set, causing an AttributeError when trying to show text to the opponent.
2. The MainGameScene is not registered in the TestApp used for testing, causing a KeyError when trying to transition to it.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll ensure that the opponent's listener is set when creating the bot.
2. In the test files, we'll update the TestApp to register both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.

Let's rewrite the necessary files with these fixes:

```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we didn't need to change anything as the `create_bot` method in `TestApp` now sets the listener for the bot.
2. In both test files, we've updated the `TestApp` class to register both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`. This ensures that the `MainGameScene` can be transitioned to during testing.
3. We've also ensured that the `create_bot` method in `TestApp` sets a `BotListener` for the bot player.

These changes should fix the AttributeError and KeyError issues while maintaining the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Role: assistant
Content: To fix the issues in the test cases, we need to address the following problems:

1. The tests are not properly handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is expected behavior when quitting the game.
2. The tests are running indefinitely due to the continuous loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll wrap the scene.run() calls in a try-except block to catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll add a counter to limit the number of scene transitions in the test, preventing infinite loops.

Let's rewrite the test files with these fixes:

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        self.transition_count = 0
        self.max_transitions = 10

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

    def transition_to_scene(self, scene_name: str, **kwargs):
        self.transition_count += 1
        if self.transition_count > self.max_transitions:
            self.quit_whole_game()
        super().transition_to_scene(scene_name, **kwargs)

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    try:
        scene.run()
    except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
        pass  # This is the expected behavior when quitting the game
    assert app.transition_count > 0, "The game should have transitioned at least once"
    assert app.transition_count <= app.max_transitions, f"The game should not have transitioned more than {app.max_transitions} times"
```

```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        self.transition_count = 0
        self.max_transitions = 10

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

    def transition_to_scene(self, scene_name: str, **kwargs):
        self.transition_count += 1
        if self.transition_count > self.max_transitions:
            self.quit_whole_game()
        super().transition_to_scene(scene_name, **kwargs)

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
    try:
        scene.run()
    except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
        pass  # This is the expected behavior when quitting the game
    assert app.transition_count > 0, "The game should have transitioned at least once"
    assert app.transition_count <= app.max_transitions, f"The game should not have transitioned more than {app.max_transitions} times"
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Catching the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception in the test functions, which is the expected behavior when the game quits.
2. Adding a `transition_count` and `max_transitions` to the `TestApp` class to limit the number of scene transitions and prevent infinite loops.
3. Overriding the `transition_to_scene` method in `TestApp` to increment the transition count and quit the game if the maximum number of transitions is reached.
4. Adding assertions to check that the game has transitioned at least once and not more than the maximum allowed transitions.

These changes should resolve the test failures while maintaining the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The tests will now run a finite number of scene transitions before quitting, and they will properly handle the game quitting exception.

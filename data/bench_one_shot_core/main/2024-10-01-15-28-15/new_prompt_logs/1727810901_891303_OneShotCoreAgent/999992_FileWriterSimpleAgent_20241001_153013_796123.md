Content: To fix the issues in the test cases, we need to address the following problems:

1. The tests are not properly handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is expected behavior when quitting the game.
2. The tests are running indefinitely due to the continuous loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll wrap the scene.run() calls in a try-except block to catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll add a counter to limit the number of scene transitions in the test, preventing infinite loops.

Let's rewrite the test files with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 3f91a64a-6036-4c1f-9388-144c6c061a75
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        self.transition_count = 0
        self.max_transitions = 10

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

    def transition_to_scene(self, scene_name: str, **kwargs):
        self.transition_count += 1
        if self.transition_count > self.max_transitions:
            self.quit_whole_game()
        super().transition_to_scene(scene_name, **kwargs)

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    try:
        scene.run()
    except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
        pass  # This is the expected behavior when quitting the game
    assert app.transition_count > 0, "The game should have transitioned at least once"
    assert app.transition_count <= app.max_transitions, f"The game should not have transitioned more than {app.max_transitions} times"
```

```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        self.transition_count = 0
        self.max_transitions = 10

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

    def transition_to_scene(self, scene_name: str, **kwargs):
        self.transition_count += 1
        if self.transition_count > self.max_transitions:
            self.quit_whole_game()
        super().transition_to_scene(scene_name, **kwargs)

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
    try:
        scene.run()
    except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
        pass  # This is the expected behavior when quitting the game
    assert app.transition_count > 0, "The game should have transitioned at least once"
    assert app.transition_count <= app.max_transitions, f"The game should not have transitioned more than {app.max_transitions} times"
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Catching the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception in the test functions, which is the expected behavior when the game quits.
2. Adding a `transition_count` and `max_transitions` to the `TestApp` class to limit the number of scene transitions and prevent infinite loops.
3. Overriding the `transition_to_scene` method in `TestApp` to increment the transition count and quit the game if the maximum number of transitions is reached.
4. Adding assertions to check that the game has transitioned at least once and not more than the maximum allowed transitions.

These changes should resolve the test failures while maintaining the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The tests will now run a finite number of scene transitions before quitting, and they will properly handle the game quitting exception.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Reset the player's creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.
2. Improve the handling of speed ties.
3. Increase the precision of damage calculations.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class, as it's responsible for the battle logic and state management. We'll stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models will remain as pure data schemas.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creature's HP to its max_hp before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll modify the speed tie handling to use a more robust random selection method.
3. We'll use float calculations for damage and only round to an integer at the final step.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

                if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                    break

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. We've added a `_reset_creature_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max_hp before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We've improved the handling of speed ties by using `random.shuffle` on a list of (creature, skill) pairs, ensuring a fair and random resolution when speeds are equal.
3. We've increased the precision of damage calculations by using float values throughout the calculation and only rounding to an integer at the final step.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is kept within the scene.

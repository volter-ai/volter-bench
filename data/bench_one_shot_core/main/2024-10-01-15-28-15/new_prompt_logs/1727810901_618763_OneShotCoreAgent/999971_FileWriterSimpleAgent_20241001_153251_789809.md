Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address the following problems:

1. The tests are failing because they're not properly handling the RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions.
2. The tests are running indefinitely, causing the random mode counter to reach zero and raise exceptions.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Modify both test files (test_main_game_scene.py and test_main_menu_scene.py) to catch and handle both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions.
2. Limit the number of iterations in the tests to prevent them from running indefinitely.
3. Reset the random mode counter before each iteration to ensure it doesn't reach zero prematurely.
4. Adjust the TestApp class to inherit from AbstractApp correctly and implement the required methods.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite both test files with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 639dc6d1-258d-4fd7-821d-f1ed762f7dc0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = f"bot_{prototype_id}"
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    max_iterations = 3
    max_choices = 50

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        HumanListener.random_mode_counter = max_choices

        try:
            scene.run()
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the random mode ends
            pass
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")

    # If we've completed all iterations without any unexpected exceptions, the test passes
    assert True
```

# Excerpt ID: 8c041048-9778-47c3-9b77-04c48fedbf42
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = f"bot_{prototype_id}"
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    max_iterations = 3
    max_choices = 50

    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
        HumanListener.random_mode_counter = max_choices

        try:
            scene.run()
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            # This exception is expected when the random mode ends
            pass
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # This exception is expected when the game ends
            pass
        except Exception as e:
            pytest.fail(f"Unexpected exception: {e}")

    # If we've completed all iterations without any unexpected exceptions, the test passes
    assert True
```

These changes should resolve the issues by:

1. Catching both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions in the test functions, allowing the tests to continue when these exceptions are raised.
2. Limiting the number of iterations to 3 (adjustable as needed) to prevent the tests from running indefinitely.
3. Resetting the random_mode_counter before each iteration to ensure it doesn't reach zero prematurely.
4. Implementing the TestApp class correctly, inheriting from AbstractApp and providing the necessary methods.

The changes are confined to the test files and do not affect the game's core logic or models. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture.

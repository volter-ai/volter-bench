Content: To address the issue of not explicitly using a queue for skills in the Resolution Phase, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. We'll introduce a queue to store the skills chosen by both players before resolving them in the Resolution Phase. This change will align the implementation more closely with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Import the `deque` class from the `collections` module to use as our skill queue.
2. Modify the `run` method to add chosen skills to the queue instead of immediately resolving them.
3. Create a new `_execute_skills` method to process the skill queue during the Resolution Phase.
4. Update the `_resolution_phase` method to use the new skill queue and execution process.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: eeadf54f-cb6b-45cd-b97d-26ae8540fbb5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name} - {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name} - {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
            "Available skills:\n" + "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            self._show_text(self.opponent, str(self))

            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            self.skill_queue.append((self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill))

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            self.skill_queue.append((self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill))

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            self._execute_skills()

    def _execute_skills(self):
        attacker, attacker_creature, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender = self.opponent
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender = self.player
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
        self._show_text(attacker, f"Your {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"Opponent's {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now explicitly uses a queue (`deque`) for skills in the Resolution Phase, addressing the discrepancy noted in the QA pass. The `skill_queue` is populated during the Player Choice and Foe Choice phases, and then processed during the Resolution Phase. This change aligns the implementation more closely with the described architecture while maintaining the existing functionality and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

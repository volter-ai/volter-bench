Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `AbstractApp` cannot be instantiated in the test files because it's an abstract class.
2. The `Player` model is missing the `active_creature` field in its initialization.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. For the `AbstractApp` issue, we'll update the test files to use the concrete `App` class instead of `AbstractApp`.

2. For the `Player` model, we'll update the `models.py` file to include the `active_creature` field with a default value of `None`. This will allow the `Player` to be instantiated without an active creature initially, which can be set later when the game starts.

Let's rewrite the `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a7d408a6-6872-4afd-a599-0c471fd44e71
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change in the `Player` model addresses the validation error by providing a default value of `None` for the `active_creature` field. The `Optional` type hint allows it to be `None` or a `Creature` instance.

For the test files, we need to update them to use the concrete `App` class instead of `AbstractApp`. Here's how we should update the test files:

# Excerpt ID: adeab89e-287b-44fe-90e0-b66e2d4ea86b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.models import Player

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = app.scene_registry["MainMenuScene"](app, player)
        try:
            scene.run()
        except App._QuitWholeGame:
            pass
    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

# Excerpt ID: 358431a6-b02a-41b4-8aca-e82d94a04fd4
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.models import Player

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = app.scene_registry["MainGameScene"](app, player)
        scene.run()
    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing. The `Player` model now has a default value for `active_creature`, and the test files use the concrete `App` class instead of the abstract `AbstractApp`.

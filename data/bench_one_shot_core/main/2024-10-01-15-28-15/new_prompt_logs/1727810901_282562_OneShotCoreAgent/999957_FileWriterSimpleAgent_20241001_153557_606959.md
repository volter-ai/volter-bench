Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the problem in the `test_main_game_scene` function. The test is failing because it's not handling the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception that's raised when the game ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `test_main_game_scene` function to catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll add a check to ensure that the game runs for a minimum number of turns before ending.
3. We'll reset the player's creatures' HP after each test run to ensure consistent starting conditions.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e4ebdee1-5e3a-46cf-aad1-069dab645992
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def reset_creatures(player):
    for creature in player.creatures:
        creature.hp = creature.max_hp

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    min_turns = 5
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = app.scene_registry["MainGameScene"](app, player)
        turns = 0
        try:
            while turns < min_turns:
                scene.run()
                turns += 1
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            pass
        assert turns >= min_turns, f"Game ended too quickly after {turns} turns"
        reset_creatures(player)
    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Catching the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, which is raised when the game ends.
2. Ensuring that the game runs for at least `min_turns` (set to 5) before ending. This helps verify that the game logic is working correctly for a minimum number of turns.
3. Resetting the HP of all creatures after each test run using the `reset_creatures` function. This ensures that each test starts with the creatures at full health.

The changes are within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models or the overall architecture. The test now properly handles the game ending and ensures that the game runs for a sufficient number of turns before concluding.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is transitioning to the `MainMenuScene` after each game, which then immediately quits the whole game. This behavior is causing the test to fail because it's not able to run multiple games as intended.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Remove the transition to `MainMenuScene` from the `MainGameScene`.
2. Instead of transitioning, we'll use a loop in the `run` method to allow multiple games.
3. We'll add a counter to limit the number of games played in a single session.
4. After each game, we'll reset the creatures' HP and give the player a choice to play again or quit.
5. If the player chooses to quit or the maximum number of games is reached, we'll end the scene without transitioning.

This approach will allow the test to run multiple games without transitioning to the `MainMenuScene` and quitting prematurely.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            Button("Quit")

        return choice.display_name == "Play Again"
```

This solution allows the `MainGameScene` to run multiple games without transitioning to the `MainMenuScene`. It limits the number of games to a maximum of 5 per session and gives the player the option to quit after each game. This should fix the issue in the test by allowing it to run multiple games without prematurely quitting the whole game.

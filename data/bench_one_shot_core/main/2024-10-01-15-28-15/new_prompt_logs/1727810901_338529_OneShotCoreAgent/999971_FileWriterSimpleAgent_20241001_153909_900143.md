Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Add an explicit welcome message in MainMenuScene.
2. Modify damage calculations to use floats and explicitly convert to integers.
3. Update type effectiveness calculations to handle the 'normal' type explicitly.
4. Clearly define the reset of the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.

These changes will primarily affect the `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` classes. I'll rewrite both files to implement these fixes.

Let's start with the `main_menu_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 7fafc18c-3b07-41e2-b80c-b63371a6ee99
```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __str__(self):
        return "Welcome to Creature Battle!\n1. Play\n2. Quit"

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to Creature Battle!")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [
            Button("Play"),
            Button("Quit")
        ])

        if choice.display_name == "Play":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        elif choice.display_name == "Quit":
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 2f154d4a-887b-438e-bf5d-f708b2e0263b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
import random
import time
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                time.sleep(2)  # Short delay to allow reading the result
                self._reset_creatures_state()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly choose who goes first
            first, second = random.sample([(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)], 2)

        self._execute_skill(*first, second[1])
        if second[1].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(*second, first[1])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.sp_attack) / float(defender_creature.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. The welcome message in `MainMenuScene` is now explicitly shown using `_show_text`.
2. Damage calculations in `_execute_skill` now use floats and explicitly convert to integers for the final damage.
3. The `_calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'normal' type.
4. The `_reset_creatures_state` method clearly defines the reset of both player's and opponent's creatures' HP when transitioning out of `MainGameScene`.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is kept within the scene classes.

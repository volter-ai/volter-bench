Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the problem in the test files. The error occurs because we're trying to instantiate the abstract `AbstractApp` class directly in the test fixtures, which is not allowed due to its abstract methods.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll create a concrete implementation of `AbstractApp` specifically for testing purposes.
2. We'll use this concrete implementation in our test fixtures instead of trying to instantiate `AbstractApp` directly.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. It doesn't affect the models, which will remain as pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the test files to implement this solution:

# Excerpt ID: 93581044-4ba0-4201-96ac-fe56a8176c99
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = "test_bot"
        bot.set_listener(HumanListener())  # Using HumanListener for predictability in tests
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.run()
    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

# Excerpt ID: 8dda037a-aebf-40b1-a873-43321ebd5b0c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = "test_bot"
        bot.set_listener(HumanListener())  # Using HumanListener for predictability in tests
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_menu_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    for _ in range(10):
        scene = MainMenuScene(app, player)
        scene.run()
    HumanListener.random_mode = False
```

These changes should resolve the `TypeError` about abstract methods in the test files. We've created a concrete `TestApp` class that implements the abstract methods `create_player` and `create_bot`. This `TestApp` is used in the test fixtures instead of trying to instantiate `AbstractApp` directly.

The `TestApp` class is defined within each test file to keep the testing logic separate from the main application code. This approach ensures that our tests can run independently without relying on the specific implementation of the main `App` class.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is kept within the scenes. The changes only affect how we set up our tests, not the actual game implementation.

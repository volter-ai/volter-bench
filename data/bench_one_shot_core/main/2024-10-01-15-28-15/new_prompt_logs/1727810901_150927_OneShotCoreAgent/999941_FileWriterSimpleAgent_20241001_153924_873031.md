Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to ensure that the final damage is converted to an integer before applying it to the creature's HP. This aligns with the architecture's specifications and ensures that HP values remain as integers throughout the game.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the _perform_attack method in the MainGameScene class to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the int() function before applying it to the creature's HP.

2. We'll ensure that all calculations involving HP are done with integer values to maintain consistency with the architecture.

This fix doesn't require any changes to the models, as they are already defined as pure data schemas without methods or properties. The change will be confined to the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```

The main change in this file is in the _perform_attack method, where we've explicitly converted the final_damage to an integer:

# Excerpt ID: 277db8ad-5c4f-4b9f-b711-08a2e0ba6320
```python
final_damage = int(raw_damage * effectiveness)  # Explicitly convert to integer
```

This ensures that the damage applied to the creature's HP is always an integer value, aligning with the architecture's specifications.

These modifications don't affect the models or the overall architecture of the game. The models remain pure data schemas without methods or properties, and they still inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer as required. We've stayed within the capabilities of the engine and maintained the separation of concerns between models, scenes, and the main application logic.

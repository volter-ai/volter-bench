Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The abstract methods `create_bot` and `create_player` in the `AbstractApp` class are not implemented in our `App` class.
2. The `MainGameScene` is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll update the `App` class in `main.py` to properly implement the `create_bot` and `create_player` methods.
2. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: b2621b46-dca3-4d96-a687-494573a2ee0a
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

Now, let's update the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends:

# Excerpt ID: 2c452a6e-b8c0-4dfb-a445-e21ca9f8a2f2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app: "AbstractApp", player: Player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return (
            f"Player: {self.player.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})\n"
            f"Opponent: {self.opponent.display_name}\n"
            f"Creature: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})\n"
        )

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
                if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The `App` class now properly implements the `create_bot` and `create_player` methods, which should resolve the `TypeError` about abstract methods.
2. The `MainGameScene` now transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, which should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is kept within the scenes.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is entering an infinite loop between the `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`, which eventually leads to a stack overflow when the test tries to quit the game.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Instead of transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after a battle ends, we'll end the scene and return control to the `App`.
2. We'll reset the creatures' HP at the beginning of each battle to ensure fresh starts.
3. We'll use a flag to determine if the game should continue or end, which will be checked by the `App` after each scene run.

This approach will prevent the infinite loop and allow the test to properly exit after a certain number of iterations.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            self.continue_game = True

            self.continue_game = False
```

This solution makes the following changes:

1. We introduce a `continue_game` flag to indicate whether the game should continue or end.
2. The `run` method now returns the `continue_game` flag, which can be used by the `App` to determine whether to start a new battle or end the game.
3. We add a `_reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of both creatures at the start of each battle.
4. Instead of transitioning to scenes within the `MainGameScene`, we now set the `continue_game` flag based on the player's choice at the end of each battle.

These changes should resolve the infinite loop issue and allow the test to complete successfully after a certain number of iterations. The `App` class will need to be updated to handle the return value from the `MainGameScene.run()` method, but that's outside the scope of this file.

Content: To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the NameError in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The error occurs because MainMenuScene is not imported in this file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll import MainMenuScene in the test_main_game_scene.py file.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary imports are present in both test files.
3. We'll keep the models and architecture unchanged, as the issue is not related to them.

Let's rewrite the test_main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 754103c0-b186-4c94-a5f7-0bbe660eae16
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.models import Player

class TestApp(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str) -> Player:
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str) -> Player:
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return TestApp()

@pytest.fixture
def player(app):
    return app.create_player("test_player")

def test_main_game_scene(app, player):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
    scene.run()
    assert scene.turn_counter <= scene.max_turns
    assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0 or scene.opponent_creature.hp == 0 or scene.turn_counter == scene.max_turns
```

This solution addresses the NameError by importing MainMenuScene at the beginning of the file. It maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as they are already correct data schemas.

The main change is the addition of this import line:
# Excerpt ID: 3f276e04-f0d7-4c85-8f96-0a68f43e141f
```python
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
```

This should resolve the NameError and allow the tests to run successfully. The rest of the file remains the same, preserving the existing structure and logic of the test.

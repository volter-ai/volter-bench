Content: To fix the issue with the tests failing due to the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception, we need to modify the test files to catch this exception. The tests are failing because they're not handling the game's graceful exit when the "Quit" option is chosen in the MainMenuScene.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify both test files (`test_main_game_scene.py` and `test_main_menu_scene.py`) to catch the `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` exception.
2. We'll add a counter to ensure that the tests run for a certain number of iterations or until the game quits.
3. We'll reset the `HumanListener.random_mode_counter` before each test run to ensure consistent behavior.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or the overall architecture. It simply improves the test cases to handle the expected game termination.

Let's rewrite both test files:

# Excerpt ID: 4ec22583-5d6b-4f3f-8699-333c9cc74e0e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_game_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    iterations = 0
    max_iterations = 10

    while iterations < max_iterations:
        try:
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
            app.transition_to_scene("MainGameScene", player=player)
            iterations += 1
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            break
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # Game quit successfully
            break

    assert iterations > 0, "The game should run at least once"
```

# Excerpt ID: 105c87cb-945f-407c-aa5e-4ba4a02e264b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.main import App

@pytest.fixture
def app():
    return App()

def test_main_menu_scene(app):
    HumanListener.random_mode = True
    player = app.create_player("test_player")
    
    iterations = 0
    max_iterations = 10

    while iterations < max_iterations:
        try:
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 100  # Reset the counter before each run
            app.transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene", player=player)
            iterations += 1
        except RandomModeGracefulExit:
            break
        except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
            # Game quit successfully
            break

    assert iterations > 0, "The game should run at least once"
```

These changes will allow the tests to run successfully, handling both the case where the game runs through multiple iterations and the case where it exits gracefully. The tests will pass as long as the game runs at least once before quitting or reaching the maximum number of iterations.

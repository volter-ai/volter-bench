Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is quitting the whole game after each battle, which is causing the test to fail after the first iteration. Instead, we should allow the scene to continue running for multiple battles until the test decides to stop.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Remove the `_quit_whole_game()` call from the scene.
2. Implement a loop in the `run` method that continues until the player chooses to quit.
3. After each battle, ask the player if they want to play again or return to the main menu.
4. If the player chooses to return to the main menu, transition to the `MainMenuScene`.

This approach will allow the scene to run multiple times without quitting the whole game, which should resolve the test failures.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        ])
        return choice.display_name == "Play Again"
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Implementing a main loop in the `run` method that continues until the player chooses to return to the main menu.
2. Moving the battle logic into a separate `_battle` method.
3. After each battle, asking the player if they want to play again or return to the main menu using the `_play_again_choice` method.
4. If the player chooses to return to the main menu, we use `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` instead of quitting the whole game.

These changes should resolve the test failures by allowing the `MainGameScene` to run multiple times without quitting the whole game. The scene will now properly transition back to the main menu when the player chooses to do so, allowing the test to run through multiple iterations as expected.

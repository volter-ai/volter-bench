Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The damage calculation in MainGameScene is incorrect. The current code has:
# Excerpt ID: 87c742d6-56a1-4edd-9526-5eaefd141581
```python
damage = creature.attack + skill.base_damage - target.hp  # Wrong!
```

But according to the documentation, it should be:
# Excerpt ID: 8d10e3f9-2f85-4e6e-a036-051834dd2f53
```
[damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

The error is that we're subtracting the target's HP instead of their defense stat. This is a simple fix in the MainGameScene.

2. Here's the corrected MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 121d0e5d-2999-4ff2-a770-e56cebc22fe6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.bot_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}:
HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
ATK: {self.player_creature.attack} DEF: {self.player_creature.defense} SPD: {self.player_creature.speed}

{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}:
HP: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}
ATK: {self.bot_creature.attack} DEF: {self.bot_creature.defense} SPD: {self.bot_creature.speed}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )

            # Bot choice phase
            self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot choosing skill...")
            self.bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution phase
            first = self.player
            second = self.bot
            first_creature = self.player_creature
            second_creature = self.bot_creature
            
            if self.bot_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed or \
               (self.bot_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
                first, second = second, first
                first_creature, second_creature = second_creature, first_creature

            # Execute skills
            for attacker, defender, creature, target in [
                (first, second, first_creature, second_creature),
                (second, first, second_creature, first_creature)
            ]:
                skill = creature.skills[0]  # Since we only have tackle
                # Corrected damage formula according to documentation
                damage = creature.attack + skill.base_damage - target.defense
                target.hp -= max(0, damage)
                
                self._show_text(self.player, 
                    f"{creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")

                if target.hp <= 0:
                    winner = "You" if target == self.bot_creature else "Bot"
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner} won the battle!")
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
```

The fix maintains all architectural requirements while correctly implementing the damage formula from the documentation. The change is isolated to just the damage calculation line, keeping all other scene and model logic intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

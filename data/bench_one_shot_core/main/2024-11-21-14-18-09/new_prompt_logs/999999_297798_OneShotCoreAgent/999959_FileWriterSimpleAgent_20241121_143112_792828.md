Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a method `is_knocked_out()` to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `is_knocked_out()` method from the Creature model
2. Move this logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Replace all calls to `is_knocked_out()` with direct HP checks in the scene

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 18d4f5e2-16d6-4064-8cf5-bcd77da4e17c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature
```

And the relevant section in main_game_scene.py needs to change from:
# Excerpt ID: 49fb8b34-59db-426a-be1b-413d78c1a159
```python
if player.active_creature.is_knocked_out():
```
to:
# Excerpt ID: 67d9c704-fd05-4538-807b-5e888961d2ae
```python
if player.active_creature.hp <= 0:
```

Would you like me to show the complete main_game_scene.py file with all the changes as well?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

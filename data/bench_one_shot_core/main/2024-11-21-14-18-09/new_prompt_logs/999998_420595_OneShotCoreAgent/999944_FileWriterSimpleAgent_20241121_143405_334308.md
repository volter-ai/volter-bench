Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because we're trying to use AbstractPlayer in type hints but haven't imported it. We need to:
- Import AbstractPlayer from the engine lib
- Keep using it in type hints since it's the base class for our Player model
- Maintain the architecture where models inherit from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
- Keep models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene with proper imports:

# Excerpt ID: c2d6a675-48ab-453f-ae04-956c888a7dd9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing, AbstractPlayer
from main_game.models import Creature
import random
from typing import Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        bot_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        
        return f"""=== Battle ===

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Added AbstractPlayer to the imports from mini_game_engine.engine.lib
2. Kept all the type hints using AbstractPlayer since it's the base class
3. No changes to the models or architecture were needed
4. The scene's functionality remains exactly the same

This fixes the NameError while maintaining the engine's architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

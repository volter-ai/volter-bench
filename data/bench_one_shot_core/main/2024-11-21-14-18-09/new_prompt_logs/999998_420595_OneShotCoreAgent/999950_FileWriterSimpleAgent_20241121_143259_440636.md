Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added the `is_knocked_out()` method to the Creature model. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `is_knocked_out()` method from the Creature model
2. Move this logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Replace all calls to `is_knocked_out()` with direct hp checks in the scene

This maintains separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while preserving the same functionality.

2. Here are the fixed files:

```

The key changes:
1. Removed `is_knocked_out()` method from Creature model
2. Replaced all calls to `is_knocked_out()` with direct `hp > 0` checks in MainGameScene
3. Models are now pure data schemas without any methods
4. All game logic remains in the scene

This maintains the same functionality while properly separating data and logic according to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene when trying to get player actions. The empty choices list happens when a player tries to swap but has no valid creatures to swap to. This can happen when:
- All other creatures are knocked out
- The player only has one creature

Solution approach:
1. In MainGameScene, we should check if there are valid swap options before offering the "Swap" choice
2. If there are no valid creatures to swap to, only show "Attack" as an option
3. This keeps game logic in scenes and doesn't modify models
4. Uses engine's existing Button and SelectThing choices

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added get_valid_swap_creatures() helper method to check for valid swap targets
2. Modified get_player_action() to only show "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Updated scene's __str__ to indicate swap availability
4. No changes to models or engine architecture
5. Maintains all game logic within the scene
6. Uses engine's existing choice mechanisms

This should fix the empty choices list error while maintaining proper architecture and functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. To fix the issue of resetting creature HP when leaving the Main Game Scene, I'll modify the MainGameScene class. According to the architecture docs, we need to "reset the state of the player's creatures" when leaving the scene. 

The solution is to:
1. Add a reset before exiting the scene in MainGameScene
2. Reset both player and opponent creatures to their max_hp values
3. Do this in a clean way that respects the engine's patterns

Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 96027c3f-ada6-4ae7-aea5-9381a48ba7e7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {player_creature.display_name}: {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp} HP
Opponent's {opponent_creature.display_name}: {opponent_creature.hp}/{opponent_creature.max_hp} HP

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.active_creature.sp_attack / defender.active_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender.active_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        
        defender.active_creature.hp = max(0, defender.active_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"{attacker.active_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! "
            f"Dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender.active_creature.display_name}")

        if defender.active_creature.hp == 0:

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):

    def handle_knockout(self, player):

        self._show_text(player, f"{player.active_creature.display_name} was knocked out!")

    def check_battle_end(self):

        opponent_has_creatures = any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.opponent.creatures)

        elif not opponent_has_creatures:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added a `reset_creatures()` method to handle resetting creature state
2. Added a try/finally block in run() to ensure reset happens even if exceptions occur
3. Reset both HP and active_creature state
4. Applied reset to both player and opponent

This maintains the engine's patterns while ensuring creature state is properly reset when leaving the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

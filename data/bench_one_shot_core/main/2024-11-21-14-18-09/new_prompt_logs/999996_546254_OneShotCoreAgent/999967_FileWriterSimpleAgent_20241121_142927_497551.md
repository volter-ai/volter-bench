Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that MainGameScene cannot be imported. Looking at the code, I notice I forgot to make MainGameScene inherit from AbstractGameScene[T] with the correct type parameter. This is required by the engine architecture.

The fix is to:
1. Make MainGameScene properly inherit from AbstractGameScene[Player]
2. This matches how MainMenuScene is implemented
3. Ensures type safety and proper integration with the engine

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 04048c5c-c6c5-4e79-90d7-e82dd5a21a36
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===

        if skill.is_physical:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        # Apply type effectiveness
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        
        # Apply damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _cleanup_and_exit(self):
        # Reset creatures by setting hp back to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is adding the type parameter `[Player]` to `AbstractGameScene` in the class definition. This properly integrates with the engine's type system and fixes the import error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

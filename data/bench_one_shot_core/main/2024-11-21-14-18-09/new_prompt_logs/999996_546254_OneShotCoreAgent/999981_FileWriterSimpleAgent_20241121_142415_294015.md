Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because the _QuitWholeGame exception isn't being caught in the test. When running random tests, we need to catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions, since either could occur during random testing.

The test is transitioning between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene repeatedly until either:
1. RandomModeGracefulExit is raised (when counter hits 0)
2. _QuitWholeGame is raised (when Quit is randomly selected)

We need to modify test_main_game_scene.py to handle both cases:

# Excerpt ID: 010dda52-fc5c-4b9d-b9b0-a0adc6f58fbd
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Import AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Add except clause for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Keep the RandomModeGracefulExit handler
4. Add a catch-all handler that re-raises unexpected exceptions

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both expected ways the random test could end:
- Counter reaching zero (RandomModeGracefulExit)
- Game being quit (_QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass since it properly handles both graceful exit conditions that can occur during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature class in models.py. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply assign max_hp to hp directly in the scene's cleanup method

This follows the architecture where:
- Models only define data structure
- All logic lives in scenes
- Scenes handle state changes

2. Here are the fixed files:

# Excerpt ID: a4c7183b-0e46-4307-bac7-f040594e82fe
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And the corresponding scene change (only showing the modified method):

# Excerpt ID: 81a63b57-fca4-4bf9-b43f-60bf4b2c82d0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
    def _cleanup_and_exit(self):
        # Reset creatures by setting hp back to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This maintains pure data models while keeping all logic in the scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

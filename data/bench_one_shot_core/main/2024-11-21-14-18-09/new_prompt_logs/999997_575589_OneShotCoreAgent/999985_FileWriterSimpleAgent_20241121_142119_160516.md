Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught, just like we do with RandomModeGracefulExit.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we see that scene transitions and game quits are properly mocked to prevent these exceptions. We should follow the same pattern in test_main_game_scene.py by:
1. Mocking _quit_whole_game to prevent the exception
2. Verifying the mock was called to ensure the game ended properly
3. Following the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py for consistency

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 53ff0202-bd87-4235-a062-95545b04c254
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Mock the quit_whole_game method to prevent the exception
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0, ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene by quitting
                    assert mock_quit.called, "scene did not end by quitting as expected"
                    print("_quit_whole_game called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock for next iteration
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This solution:
1. Stays within engine capabilities by properly handling the expected exceptions
2. Maintains consistency with other tests in the codebase
3. Properly verifies the game ending condition
4. Keeps the random testing functionality intact
5. Doesn't require any changes to the models or game logic

The test now properly handles both ways the scene can end:
1. Via RandomModeGracefulExit when the random moves counter expires
2. Via _quit_whole_game when the battle naturally concludes

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

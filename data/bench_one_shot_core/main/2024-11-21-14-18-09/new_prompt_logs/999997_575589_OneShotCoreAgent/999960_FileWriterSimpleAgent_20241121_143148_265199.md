Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly calling _quit_whole_game() or _transition_to_scene().

According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always explicitly end via one of these two methods:
- _quit_whole_game() - To end the entire game
- _transition_to_scene() - To move to another scene

Solution:
- When the battle ends (either win or loss), we should call _quit_whole_game() since this is the final scene
- This should be done in check_battle_end() when we detect a win/loss condition
- Remove the returns from run() method and let it continue looping until an explicit transition/quit happens

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                    self._show_text(player, f"Go {choice.thing.display_name}!")
```

Key changes:
1. Added _quit_whole_game() calls in check_battle_end() when win/loss conditions are met
2. Removed returns from run() method and changed to continues
3. Let the game loop continue until _quit_whole_game() is called
4. Maintained all the pure data model requirements and scene architecture

This ensures the scene properly terminates through the engine's expected mechanisms rather than just returning.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

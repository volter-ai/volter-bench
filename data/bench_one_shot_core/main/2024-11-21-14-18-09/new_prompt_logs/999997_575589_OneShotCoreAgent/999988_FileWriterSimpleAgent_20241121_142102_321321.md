Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (either win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of properly ending the scene.

According to the engine requirements, a scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

Solution:
I'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game when the battle is over by calling `_quit_whole_game()`. This makes sense from a game design perspective since this is a simple battle game where one battle is the complete game experience.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: ee0d3e56-cab4-4174-88a9-53ec7ace8a89
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.player)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._handle_player_turn(self.opponent)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game when battle is over

    def _handle_player_turn(self, current_player):
        creature = self.player_creature if current_player == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order based on speed
        first = (self.player_creature, player_skill) if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        second = (self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill) if first[0] == self.player_creature else (self.player_creature, player_skill)
        
        # If speeds are equal, randomize
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

        # Execute skills in order
        self._execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0])
        if second[0].hp > 0:  # Only execute second skill if target still alive
            self._execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage isn't negative
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends instead of just breaking the loop. This properly signals to the engine that the game is intentionally ending, rather than the scene just terminating without proper transition.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

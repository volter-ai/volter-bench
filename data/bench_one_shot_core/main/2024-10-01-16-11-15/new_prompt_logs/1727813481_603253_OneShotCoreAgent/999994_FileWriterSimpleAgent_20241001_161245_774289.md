Content: I understand the issues raised and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Implement an explicit queue system for skills in the Resolution Phase:
   - Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the MainGameScene class.
   - Modify the player and foe choice phases to add chosen skills to the queue.
   - Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queue.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene:
   - Add a method to reset creature stats at the end of the battle.
   - Call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the updated implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 434cdb94-9e3a-4e59-889e-094a68592e3b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from typing import List, Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Creature, Creature, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self.get_skill_list(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_list(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.skill_queue.clear()

            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player_creature, self.foe_creature, skill))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.foe_creature, self.player_creature, skill))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        for attacker, defender, skill in self.skill_queue:
            defender.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. It introduces an explicit `skill_queue` to store the skills chosen by both the player and the foe. The Resolution Phase now processes skills from this queue.

2. A `reset_creatures` method has been added, which is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This method resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum value, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset after each battle.

These changes align with the described architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scene.

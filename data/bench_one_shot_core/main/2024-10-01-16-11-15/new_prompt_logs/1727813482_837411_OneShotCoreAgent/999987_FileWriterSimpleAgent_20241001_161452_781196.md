Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Description of the fix:
To address the issue of using integers instead of floats for damage calculations, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. We'll change the damage calculation process to use floats throughout and only convert to an integer at the final step. This will ensure that we follow the architecture specification more closely.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 8682d527-2f92-43df-8ff8-bdd0685a6dad
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2.0,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2.0,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2.0,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. In the `execute_skill` method, we now use `float()` to ensure that all calculations are done with floating-point numbers:
# Excerpt ID: d4a59f36-8aaf-47d2-b38d-a4d9f6ec6e91
   ```python
   raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
   ```

2. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now returns floating-point numbers (2.0, 0.5, 1.0) instead of integers.

3. The final damage calculation now uses floating-point arithmetic throughout, only converting to an integer at the last step:
# Excerpt ID: 771d5efb-5fe0-45d6-a3a7-a93fb906ef0b
   ```python
   final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
   ```

These changes ensure that we're using floats for all damage calculations, as specified in the architecture, while still maintaining integer HP values for the creatures. This approach should resolve the discrepancy noted in the QA pass while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the model guidelines.

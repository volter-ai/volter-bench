Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Update the damage calculation for special skills to match the specified formula in the architecture document.
2. Remove the conversion of final damage to an integer, as this was not specified in the architecture.
3. Remove the minimum damage handling, as it was not specified in the architecture.
4. Modify the `reset_creatures` method to reset all creature attributes to their initial values, not just HP.

These changes will ensure that the implementation aligns with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 61090f81-f7eb-4171-a3f7-bec1a5b6a7c4

            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self.end_battle()

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"normal": 1, "fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"normal": 1, "fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}

    def reset_creatures(self):

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The damage calculation for special skills now uses the correct formula: `(attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage`.
2. The final damage is no longer converted to an integer, preserving the floating-point value as calculated.
3. The minimum damage handling has been removed, as it was not specified in the architecture.
4. The `reset_creatures` method now completely resets both creatures to their initial states by creating new instances from their prototype IDs.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need to be changed, as it already contains the necessary attributes for the creatures and skills.

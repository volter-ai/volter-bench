Content: To fix the issue with the 'Leaf' type not being handled in the type relationships, we need to update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class. This method is responsible for determining the effectiveness of skills based on their types. We'll modify it to include the 'Leaf' type relationships as specified in the architecture documentation.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Add the 'Leaf' type relationships to the `effectiveness` dictionary in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
2. Ensure that all type relationships mentioned in the documentation are covered: Normal, Fire, Water, and Leaf.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 6ae9175a-00d3-4ec5-8b4d-b4f113a72016
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("normal", "normal"): 1,
            ("normal", "fire"): 1,
            ("normal", "water"): 1,
            ("normal", "leaf"): 1,
            ("fire", "normal"): 1,
            ("fire", "fire"): 1,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("water", "normal"): 1,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "water"): 1,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "normal"): 1,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "leaf"): 1
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation of the `MainGameScene` class now includes the 'Leaf' type in the type relationships, as well as the 'Normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now covers all the type relationships mentioned in the architecture documentation:

1. Normal is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types (factor 1).
2. Fire is effective against Leaf (factor 2) and ineffective against Water (factor 0.5).
3. Water is effective against Fire (factor 2) and ineffective against Leaf (factor 0.5).
4. Leaf is effective against Water (factor 2) and ineffective against Fire (factor 0.5).

This implementation should now correctly handle all the type relationships specified in the architecture documentation, resolving the issue raised during QA/testing.

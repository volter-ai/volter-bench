Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement proper handling of normal type skills in damage calculations.
2. Use integer arithmetic to avoid floating-point precision issues.
3. Add explicit checks for creature HP reaching zero during skill execution.
4. Ensure proper reset of creature states when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: caca2a1d-e5a4-4bfb-a68e-c41576779593

            "leaf": {"water": 200, "fire": 50}

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Normal type skills are now handled correctly by using a default effectiveness of 100 (normal effectiveness) in the `_get_weakness_factor` method.
2. Integer arithmetic is used throughout the damage calculation to avoid floating-point precision issues. The weakness factor is now represented as an integer percentage (e.g., 200 for double damage, 50 for half damage).
3. An explicit check for creature HP reaching zero is added in the `_execute_skill` method, which sets the `battle_ended` flag if a creature's HP reaches zero.
4. The `_reset_creatures` method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, ensuring that creature states are properly reset.

These changes should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the overall architecture of the game.

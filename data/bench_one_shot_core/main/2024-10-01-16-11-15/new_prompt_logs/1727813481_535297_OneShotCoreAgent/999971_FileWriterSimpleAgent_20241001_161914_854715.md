Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Explicitly handle normal type skills by adding them to the effectiveness chart with a default factor of 1.0 for all creature types.
2. Clearly define the random ordering of creatures with equal speed by using a consistent method.
3. Remove the explicit check for at least 1 damage being dealt, as this is not mentioned in the architecture.

These changes will be implemented in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's the rewritten file with these modifications:

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Normal type skills are now explicitly handled in the effectiveness chart, with a factor of 1.0 for all creature types.
2. The random ordering of creatures with equal speed is now clearly defined using a consistent method (random.random() < 0.5).
3. The explicit check for at least 1 damage being dealt has been removed, as it's not mentioned in the architecture.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns more closely with the architecture specifications while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The overall structure of the MainGameScene remains consistent with the rest of the implementation.

Content: To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement explicit handling of a creature being 'knocked out' when hp reaches zero.
2. Implement a skill queue and remove skills from the queue as they are executed.

These changes will align the implementation more closely with the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: e28a8c70-300e-4ab3-8f31-f5fd82a71b4f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            if self.is_knocked_out(defender_creature):
                self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} has been knocked out!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. We now have explicit handling of a creature being 'knocked out' when hp reaches zero. The `is_knocked_out` method checks if a creature's HP is 0 or below, and we use this method in the `resolution_phase` and `check_battle_end` methods.

2. We've implemented a skill queue (`self.skill_queue`) that stores the skills chosen by both the player and the foe. In the `resolution_phase`, we pop skills from this queue and execute them one by one. This ensures that skills are removed from the queue as they are executed.

These changes bring the implementation more in line with the architecture documentation while maintaining the structure and capabilities of the engine.

Content: I understand the issues raised during the QA/testing phase. I'll address each point and propose a solution that aligns more closely with the architecture while staying within the engine's capabilities.

1. Adding a welcome message to the MainMenuScene:
   We'll add a welcome message to the MainMenuScene's run method, using the _show_text method to display it.

2. Explicitly converting final damage to an integer:
   In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the _calculate_damage method to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer as the last step.

3. Ensuring proper reset of player's creatures:
   We'll move the _reset_player_creatures call to the end of the run method in the MainGameScene, ensuring it's called just before transitioning out of the scene.

Here are the proposed solutions for both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene:

    def _reset_player_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. A welcome message is now shown in the MainMenuScene's run method.
2. The final damage conversion to an integer is explicitly done as the last step in the _calculate_damage method of the MainGameScene.
3. The _reset_player_creatures method is now called at the end of the run method in the MainGameScene, ensuring it's executed just before transitioning out of the scene.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the engine's capabilities and adhering more closely to the architecture specifications.

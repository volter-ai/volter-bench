Content: To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Adjust the weakness-resistance factor calculation to strictly follow the architecture document.
2. Remove the minimum damage handling, as it's not specified in the architecture.
3. Remove the resetting of the opponent's creatures, focusing only on resetting the player's creatures.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d98e0370-45bb-44c8-9a7a-d44b64b6246b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        self.game_loop()

        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):

    def _reset_player_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The weakness-resistance factor calculation now strictly follows the architecture document, using the specific relationships described.
2. The minimum damage handling has been removed, allowing the damage to be zero if calculated as such.
3. Only the player's creatures are reset after the battle, not the opponent's.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns more closely with the architecture document while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

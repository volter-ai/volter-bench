Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class to explicitly show that the foe (bot) is seeing its own creature's skills and to clearly implement the display of the creature's list of available skills to the player. Here's how I will fix the issue:

1. Modify the `__str__` method to include both the player's and foe's creature skills.
2. Update the `player_choice_phase` method to show the skills to both the player and the foe.
3. Use the `_show_text` method to display the available skills before waiting for a choice.

These changes will ensure that both the player and the foe (bot) see their respective creature's skills, and the display of available skills is clearly implemented.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: d8712d90-d1c5-4670-a1ea-e2fdc57191e5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List, Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Skill, Creature, Creature]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

{self.player.display_name}'s skills:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

{self.foe.display_name}'s skills:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.foe_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature, self.foe_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature, self.player_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature):
        skill_choices = self.get_skill_choices_str(attacker)
        self._show_text(player, f"{player.display_name}'s turn. Available skills:\n{skill_choices}")
        
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in attacker.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        skill = next(skill for skill in attacker.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.skill_queue.append((skill, attacker, defender))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        for skill, attacker, defender in self.skill_queue:
            defender.hp -= skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self.skill_queue.clear()

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `__str__` method now includes both the player's and foe's creature skills, making it clear that both sides can see their respective skills.
2. The `player_choice_phase` method now uses `_show_text` to display the available skills to both the player and the foe before waiting for a choice.
3. The display of the creature's list of available skills is now clearly implemented using the `get_skill_choices_str` method.

These modifications ensure that the implementation explicitly shows that the foe (bot) is seeing its own creature's skills, and the display of the creature's list of available skills to the player is clearly implemented. The changes adhere to the guidelines and architecture of the engine, and no modifications were needed in the `models.py` file as the models remain pure data schemas.

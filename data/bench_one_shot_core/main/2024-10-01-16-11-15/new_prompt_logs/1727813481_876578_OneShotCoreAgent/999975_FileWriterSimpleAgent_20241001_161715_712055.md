Content: I understand the issues raised during the QA/testing phase. I'll address each point and propose a solution that aligns more closely with the architecture while staying within the engine's capabilities.

1. Handling ties in speed: We'll implement a random selection when speeds are equal, as specified in the architecture.
2. Negative damage: We'll ensure damage can't be negative by using max(0, damage).
3. Division by zero in special attack calculations: We'll add a check to prevent division by zero.
4. Handling of unspecified skill types: We'll treat unspecified skill types as normal type.
5. Use of only the first creature per player: We'll keep this as is, as the architecture doesn't specify using multiple creatures per player.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 2e06c2d8-8c76-4b46-bdde-5b305cf013eb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

        self._show_battle_result()
        self._reset_player_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} and deals {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            if defender.sp_defense == 0:
                raw_damage = float(skill.base_damage)  # Avoid division by zero
            else:
                raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(0, final_damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _show_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_player_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. Speed ties are now resolved randomly using `random.sample()`.
2. Damage cannot be negative due to the `max(0, final_damage)` check.
3. Division by zero is prevented in special attack calculations.
4. Unspecified skill types are treated as normal (factor of 1) in the `_get_weakness_factor` method.
5. We continue to use only the first creature for each player, as the architecture doesn't specify using multiple creatures.

These changes should resolve the issues while staying within the engine's capabilities and adhering to the architecture specifications.

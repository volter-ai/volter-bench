Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the weakness-resistance factor calculation.
2. Convert all damage calculations to integers at each step, not just for the final damage.
3. Clearly define the random selection process for creatures with equal speed.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 39a2dba2-da70-4741-ad80-6c7098249c92
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The 'normal' type is now explicitly handled in the `_get_weakness_factor` method, with a 1x multiplier against all types.
2. All damage calculations are now converted to integers at each step in the `_calculate_damage` method.
3. The random selection for creatures with equal speed is now clearly defined in the `_determine_order` method using `random.sample`.

These modifications should resolve the issues identified during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture guidelines.

Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Equal speed handling: We'll modify the resolution phase to randomly determine which creature goes first when their speeds are equal.
   b. Damage calculation: We'll remove the minimum damage of 1 and stick to the formula provided in the architecture.
   c. Transition after winning: Instead of transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, we'll end the game after the battle concludes, as the architecture doesn't specify a transition.

2. We'll rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 32b59ec1-c0e9-4136-825c-ae2d0cfc4911
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appears!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.handle_battle_end()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly determine who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
                if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                    self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now handles the case of equal speed by randomly determining which creature goes first.
2. The `execute_skill` method no longer enforces a minimum damage of 1, adhering to the specified damage calculation formula.
3. The `handle_battle_end` method now simply ends the game after the battle concludes, without transitioning to another scene.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns with the architecture documents and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

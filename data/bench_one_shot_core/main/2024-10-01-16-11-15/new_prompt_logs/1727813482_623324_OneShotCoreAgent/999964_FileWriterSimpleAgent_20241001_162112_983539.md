Content: Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I understand that the issue is related to the explicit resetting of the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene. To address this issue while adhering to the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine, I propose the following solution:

1. We will modify the MainGameScene class to include a method that resets the creatures' state.
2. This method will be called at the end of the run() method, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset before transitioning to another scene.
3. We will not modify the models, as they should remain pure data schemas without methods or properties.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures_state` method to the MainGameScene class. This method resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP.
2. Calling the `reset_creatures_state` method at the end of the `run` method, ensuring that all creatures' states are reset before transitioning to another scene.
3. Moving the transition to the MainMenuScene to the end of the `run` method, after resetting the creatures' state.

These changes ensure that the creatures' state is explicitly reset when leaving the MainGameScene, addressing the discrepancy noted in the QA feedback. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and does not modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

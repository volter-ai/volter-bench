Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Implement random execution order for skills when creature speeds are equal.
2. Handle the Normal type in the weakness-resistance factor calculations.
3. Add the Leaf type to the game content.

Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolve_turn` method of `MainGameScene`, I'll add a condition to randomly choose the order when speeds are equal.
2. I'll update the `_get_weakness_factor` method to handle the Normal type correctly.
3. I'll add a new Leaf-type creature and skill to the JSON content files.

Now, I'll rewrite the necessary files with the proposed solutions:

}
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. The `_resolve_turn` method now handles equal speeds by randomly choosing the order of skill execution.
2. The `_get_weakness_factor` method now includes the "normal" type, which has no strengths or weaknesses against other types.
3. A new Leaf-type creature (Leafeon) and a Leaf-type skill (Leaf Blade) have been added to the game content.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The scene is not handling the end of the game correctly, which is causing the FixableException in the whole game test.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll modify the battle_loop method to use this new end_battle method when the battle is over.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits properly by calling either _transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ddfda1df-13c7-4fdb-b8fa-829a52f65e74
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that provides the player with options to play again or quit the game.
2. Modifying the `battle_loop` method to call `end_battle` when the battle ends.
3. Ensuring that the scene always exits properly by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` in the `end_battle` method.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the scene exits as expected, fixing both the MainGameScene random run test and the whole game test.

Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Strictly define the weakness-resistance factor as 2 for effective and 0.5 for ineffective in the `get_type_effectiveness` method.
2. Ensure that damage calculations explicitly convert to integers only at the return statement in the `calculate_damage` method.
3. Add a reset functionality for the player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. Modify the `get_type_effectiveness` method to return exactly 2 for effective, 0.5 for ineffective, and 1 for neutral matchups.
2. Update the `calculate_damage` method to perform all calculations using floats and only convert to an integer at the return statement.
3. Add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp when transitioning out of the scene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `get_type_effectiveness` method now strictly returns 2.0 for effective, 0.5 for ineffective, and 1.0 for neutral matchups.
2. The `calculate_damage` method now performs all calculations using floats and only converts to an integer at the return statement.
3. A new `reset_creatures` method has been added to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp when transitioning out of the scene. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture and ensure that the implementation adheres to the specified requirements.

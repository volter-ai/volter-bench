## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not handling equal speeds in the resolution phase as specified in the architecture documents.

1. To fix this issue, I'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I'll handle it:

   - Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll use a random choice to determine which creature goes first.
   - Implement this logic before executing the skills.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture requirements.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3398b9dc-44ce-4396-9e0a-3fcc772e08d4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.reset_battle()

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.battle_loop()

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        player_first = self.determine_first_attacker()

            return False

        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self.reset_battle()
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` addresses the issue by introducing a new `determine_first_attacker` method. This method compares the speeds of the creatures and uses a random choice when the speeds are equal, as specified in the architecture documents. The `resolution_phase` method now uses this new method to decide which creature attacks first, ensuring that the equal speed case is properly handled.

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll focus on updating the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Implement 'Back' options in the attack and swap choices.
2. Add random order handling for equal speeds in skill execution.
3. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.

These changes will be made while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing model structure.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. 'Back' options have been added to both the attack and swap choices, allowing players to return to the main choice menu.
2. Random order handling for equal speeds in skill execution has been implemented by adding a random tiebreaker when sorting actions by speed.
3. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero has been implemented through the `check_forced_swap` method, which is called after each action in the `resolve_turn` method.

These changes maintain the existing model structure and stay within the capabilities of the engine while addressing the identified issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
4. We'll call this method when a player wins the battle.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 6eed42a0-f8ed-4006-aade-a3f2a967fcaa
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, AbstractPlayer

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.opponent_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while True:
            if self.player_choice_phase() and self.foe_choice_phase():
                if not self.resolution_phase():
                    break
            else:
                break
        self.handle_battle_end()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.player_skill_queue.append(selected_skill)
        return True

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent's turn!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self.opponent_skill_queue.append(selected_skill)
        return True

    def resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        opponent_skill = self.opponent_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} wins!")
            return False

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name} wins!")
            return False

        return True

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle has ended!")
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `handle_battle_end` method that is called after the battle loop ends.
2. In `handle_battle_end`, we give the player a choice to play again or quit.
3. Based on the player's choice, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
4. We call `handle_battle_end` after the main battle loop, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene will now always end by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which should satisfy the requirements of the engine and fix the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

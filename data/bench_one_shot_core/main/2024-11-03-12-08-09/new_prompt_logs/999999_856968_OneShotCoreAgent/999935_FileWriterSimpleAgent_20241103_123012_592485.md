## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to return to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 01fd3dca-a962-44de-9c8e-fd3130fef8f8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Handle end of battle
        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self.get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")

        # Add a button to return to the main menu
        continue_button = Button("Continue")
        self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [continue_button])

        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. The main changes are:

1. We've modified the `run` method to call `end_battle` after the battle loop ends.
2. We've added an `end_battle` method that displays the battle result, waits for the player to press a "Continue" button, and then transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We've simplified the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean instead of handling the end-of-battle logic directly.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which should resolve the test failures and the FixableException we were seeing.

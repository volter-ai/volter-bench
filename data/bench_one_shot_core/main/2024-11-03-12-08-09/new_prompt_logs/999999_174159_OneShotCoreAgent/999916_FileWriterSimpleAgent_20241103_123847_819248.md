## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

The issue is that we're not implementing the random decision for equal speed in skill execution order as specified in the architecture documentation. To fix this, we need to modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Instead of always giving priority to the player when speeds are equal, we'll introduce a random decision.

Here's how we'll fix it:
- In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll check if the speeds are equal.
- If they are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
- We'll then execute the skills in the randomly determined order.

This change will ensure that when creatures have equal speed, the order of skill execution is randomly determined, as specified in the architecture documentation.

2. Updated file:

```

This updated `main_game_scene.py` file now correctly implements the random decision for equal speed in skill execution order, as specified in the architecture documentation. The `resolve_turn` method now handles the case of equal speeds by randomly choosing which creature goes first, ensuring fair and unpredictable gameplay when creatures have the same speed.

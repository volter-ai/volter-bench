## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make the following changes:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp when the battle ends.
2. We'll do this in the check_battle_end method, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll reset both the player's and the opponent's creatures to ensure consistency.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 07ba1ccb-05e6-4d32-87d1-a968e7335230
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices).thing

    def foe_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices).thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")

        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds a new method `reset_creatures()` which resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. This method is called in the `check_battle_end()` method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene.

This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas and implementing the game logic within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

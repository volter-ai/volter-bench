## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a method to check if the player wants to play again after the battle ends.

3. We'll ensure that all paths in the game loop lead to either a scene transition or quitting the game.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly:

1. After a battle ends (when `_check_battle_end()` returns True), we now ask the player if they want to play again.
2. If the player chooses to play again, we reset the creatures' HP and start a new battle.
3. If the player chooses not to play again, we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
4. We've added a break statement after transitioning to ensure the game loop ends.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits either by transitioning to another scene or by allowing the player to quit, which should resolve the test failures and adhere to the engine's requirements.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene doesn't have a proper exit condition, causing it to run indefinitely.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add a `game_over` flag to track when the battle has ended.
2. Modify the `check_battle_end` method to set the `game_over` flag when the battle ends.
3. Update the `battle_loop` to break when `game_over` is True.
4. After the battle loop ends, transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: a9d75409-274b-417d-af8e-0748ac50ef4a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.game_over = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while not self.game_over:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            self.check_battle_end()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.game_over = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.game_over = True
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over. This should fix both the random run test for MainGameScene and the full game flow test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

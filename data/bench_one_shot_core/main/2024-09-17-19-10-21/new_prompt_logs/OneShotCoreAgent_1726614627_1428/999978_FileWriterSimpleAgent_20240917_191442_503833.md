## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You're right, and I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added class methods to the models, which violates the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties. Let's fix this issue by removing the class methods and keeping the models as pure data schemas.

1. To fix this issue, we need to:
   - Remove all class methods from the models in `models.py`.
   - Keep the models as pure data schemas, inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.
   - Move any logic for creating instances from prototype IDs to the scenes or other appropriate parts of the game logic.

2. Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0f52db3b-c039-4df7-820c-5a83a8764912
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This rewritten `models.py` file addresses the issue by:

1. Removing all class methods, including `from_prototype_id`.
2. Keeping the models as pure data schemas, only defining the attributes of each class.
3. Maintaining the inheritance from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer as required.

With these changes, the models are now pure data schemas without any methods or properties, which should resolve the AttributeError we were encountering.

To handle the creation of instances from prototype IDs, we'll need to implement this logic in the appropriate scenes or in the `App` class. For example, in the `App` class's `create_player` and `create_bot` methods, we'll need to manually create the Player instances and their associated Creatures and Skills using the data from the JSON files.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the guidelines for model creation in the game architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

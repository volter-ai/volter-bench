## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game when the battle ends. We'll also update the `__str__` method to display all relevant information for the scene.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. Add a call to `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends.
2. Update the `__str__` method to show all relevant battle information.
3. Modify the `run` method to use a while loop that continues until the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 57a25074-416c-4ff3-933e-af4efebc442f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self._check_battle_end()

        # Battle has ended, quit the game
        self._quit_whole_game()

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self._execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.battle_ended:
            self._execute_skill(*second)

    def _determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.creatures[0].attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.creatures[0].sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.battle_ended = True
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `run` method to use a while loop that continues until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Calling `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, ensuring that the scene exits properly.
4. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to set the `battle_ended` flag when appropriate.

The `__str__` method now displays all relevant battle information, including both creatures' HP and the available skills for the player.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly when the battle ends. The scene will now either transition to another scene or quit the whole game, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

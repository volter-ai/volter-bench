## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is happening because the battle loop ends without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, instead of just returning True when the battle ends, we'll transition to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll add a message to inform the player that they're returning to the main menu.
3. We'll remove the return statement from the `battle_loop` method since it's no longer needed.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 4d03a06a-deaa-4738-9059-be469da780f9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, addressing the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This should resolve the FixableException we were seeing in the test output.

The modifications maintain the existing architecture and model structure, staying within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file doesn't need any changes as it already follows the guidelines of being pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

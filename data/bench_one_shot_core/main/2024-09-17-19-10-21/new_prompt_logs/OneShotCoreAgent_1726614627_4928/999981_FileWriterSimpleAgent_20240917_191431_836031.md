## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight. You're right, and I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method to the Player model, which violates the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties. Let's fix this issue by removing the class method and handling the initialization of the active_creature in the App class instead.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player class in `models.py`.
2. Keep the `active_creature` field as Optional[Creature] in the Player class.
3. Modify the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in the `App` class to initialize the `active_creature`.

Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 4c735cc1-a737-404c-817a-66a8464912dd
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, we need to update the `main.py` file to handle the initialization of the `active_creature`. Here's the updated `main.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: f62b76c7-b814-4004-9184-192fe7892f51
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes should resolve the issue while adhering to the guidelines for models in the game. The `Player` class in `models.py` is now a pure data schema without any methods, and the initialization of the `active_creature` is handled in the `App` class methods `create_player` and `create_bot`.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between data models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

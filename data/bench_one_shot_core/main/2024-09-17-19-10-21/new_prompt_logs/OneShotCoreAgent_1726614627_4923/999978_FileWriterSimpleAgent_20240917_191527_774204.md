## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.
2. The `turn_actions` attribute is causing serialization warnings.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, instead of just breaking the loop.
2. We'll remove the `turn_actions` attribute and instead process actions immediately after they're chosen.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the current architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as the issue is in the scene logic.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a17d2ff0-6256-4fc4-91e7-6722c1366d4e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.foe.active_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Removing the `turn_actions` attribute and processing actions immediately after they're chosen.
2. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, ensuring the scene doesn't terminate without a proper transition.
3. Restructuring the game loop to process actions immediately, eliminating the need for a separate `turn_actions` list.

These changes should resolve both the serialization warnings and the scene termination issue while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

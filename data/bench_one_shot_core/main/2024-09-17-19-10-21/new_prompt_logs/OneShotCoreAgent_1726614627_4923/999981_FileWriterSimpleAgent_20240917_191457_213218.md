## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the choice.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return without making a choice, effectively skipping the swap action.
3. We'll also add a check in the `choose_action` method to only offer the "Swap" option if there are creatures available to swap to.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models. It addresses the issue by preventing the scenario where `_wait_for_choice` is called with no choices.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `get_available_creatures` method to check for creatures that can be swapped to.
2. Modifying the `choose_action` method to only offer the "Swap" option if there are available creatures.
3. Updating the `choose_swap` method to return early if there are no available creatures to swap to.

These changes ensure that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices, which should resolve the AssertionError we were seeing in the tests. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, maintaining the architecture and guidelines of the project.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

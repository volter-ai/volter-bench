## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not properly handling the end of the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a way to quit the whole game if the player chooses to do so after the battle.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 72812a52-f33f-4df0-8f85-40c8aed0a631
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.player_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            if self.bot_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break

        self.end_battle()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.bot_creature, choice.thing)

    def bot_turn(self):
        bot_skill = random.choice(self.bot_creature.skills)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot_creature.display_name} uses {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        return self.execute_skill(self.bot_creature, self.player_creature, bot_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")
        return defender.hp == 0

    def calculate_weakness(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that is called after the battle loop ends.
2. In the `end_battle` method, we give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. If the player chooses to play again, we transition back to the MainMenuScene.
4. If the player chooses to quit, we call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the whole game. This should resolve both the issues in the MainGameScene test and the whole game flow test.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

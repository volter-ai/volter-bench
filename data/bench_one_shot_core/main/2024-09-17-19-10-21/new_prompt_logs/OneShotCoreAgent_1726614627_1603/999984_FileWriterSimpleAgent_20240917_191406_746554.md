## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the tests to fail because the scene is not exiting in the expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a method to check if the player wants to play again after the battle ends.

3. We'll use the `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` methods to properly exit the scene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: adea896a-ad65-4e88-a0d9-1332d0f4fb23
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():

        return choice.thing

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True

        choices = [play_again_button, main_menu_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly by either transitioning to a new scene or returning to the main menu. The `_play_again` method gives the player the option to play another battle or return to the main menu, which should resolve the test failures and make the game flow more robust.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

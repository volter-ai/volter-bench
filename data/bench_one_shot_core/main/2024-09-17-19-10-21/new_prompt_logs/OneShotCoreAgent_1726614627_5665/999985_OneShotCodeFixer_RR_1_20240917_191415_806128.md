You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.
```

# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
- `active_creature` - The player's creature that is currently on the field and participating in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's physical attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to physical attacks.
- `sp_attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's non-physical attacks.
- `sp_defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to non-physical attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `is_physical` - A boolean indicating whether the skill is a physical skill or a non-physical (special) skill.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements.

Plan:

1. Create the models in `main_game/models.py`:
   - Implement `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes, inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`.
   - Ensure proper type annotations and dependency order.

2. Create JSON content files in `main_game/content/`:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes.
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes.
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes.

3. Implement the `MainMenuScene` in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Update the existing implementation to match the requirements.

4. Implement the `MainGameScene` in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Create the battle logic with player and foe choice phases, and resolution phase.
   - Implement skill execution, damage calculation, and type relationships.
   - Handle creature swapping and battle end conditions.

5. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register the `MainGameScene`.
   - Ensure proper creation of players and bots.

6. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`: Update with the provided template.
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`: Create a new test file for `MainGameScene`.

Now, I'll implement each file according to this plan:

2. JSON content files in `main_game/content/`
3. `MainMenuScene` in `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`
4. `MainGameScene` in `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`
5. Updated `main_game/main.py`
6. Test files for both scenes

The implementation follows the guidelines provided, including proper inheritance, type annotations, and scene logic. The game now includes a main menu and a battle system with creatures, skills, and type effectiveness.

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Role: assistant
Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the missing `active_creature` field in the `Player` class. The error occurs because the `Player` model is expecting an `active_creature` field, but it's not being provided when creating a player from the prototype.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]` and setting a default value of `None`.

2. We'll update the `create_player` method in `main.py` to set the `active_creature` to the first creature in the player's list of creatures.

Let's rewrite the `models.py` file with these changes:

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, let's update the `main.py` file to set the `active_creature` when creating a player:

```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
import uuid

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes should resolve the ValidationError we were encountering. By making `active_creature` optional in the `Player` model and setting it in the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods, we ensure that the `Player` object is properly initialized with an `active_creature` when it's created.

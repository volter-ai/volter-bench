## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is happening because the game loop ends when a battle is over, but it doesn't transition to another scene or quit the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `game_loop` method to continue running until explicitly told to stop.
2. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended and handle the end-game scenario.
3. After a battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` instead of just ending the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 54ce083b-213f-4aee-8e6a-587c187a160e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            self.check_battle_end()

        # After the battle ends, transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True

```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The `game_loop` now continues until `self.battle_ended` is set to True.
2. The `check_battle_end` method sets `self.battle_ended` to True when a creature's HP reaches 0 or below.
3. After the battle ends, the scene transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These changes ensure that the scene doesn't terminate without calling `transition_to_scene`, which should resolve the FixableException we were seeing. The game will now properly cycle between the main menu and battles, allowing for multiple playthroughs without crashing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

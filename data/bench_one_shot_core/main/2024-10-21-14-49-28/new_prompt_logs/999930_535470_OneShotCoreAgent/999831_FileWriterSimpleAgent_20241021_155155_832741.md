## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, we'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Handle speed ties randomly in the resolution phase.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's how we'll implement these changes:

1. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, we'll add a 'Back' option when choosing an attack or swap.
2. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker for speed ties.
3. We'll add a `_reset_creatures` method and call it at the end of the `run` method.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `_choose_attack` and `_choose_swap` methods.
2. Speed ties are now handled randomly in the `_resolution_phase` method by adding a random tiebreaker to the sorting key.
3. The `_reset_creatures` method is added and called at the end of the `run` method to reset the state of all creatures when leaving the scene.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models. The `MainGameScene` class now fully aligns with the architecture and requirements specified in the original design.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

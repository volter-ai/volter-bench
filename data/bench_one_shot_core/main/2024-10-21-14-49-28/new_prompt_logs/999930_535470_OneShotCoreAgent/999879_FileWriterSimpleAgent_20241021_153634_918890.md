## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Modify the resolution phase to handle equal speeds by deciding randomly.
2. Add an explicit prompt for swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll add a random tiebreaker for creatures with equal speed.
2. We'll create a new method `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` to handle creature swapping when HP reaches zero.
3. We'll call this new method after each attack in the `_resolution_phase`.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 40f43c45-d7af-4c0e-8d43-674a34bf42f1

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The resolution phase now handles equal speeds by adding a random tiebreaker when sorting the turn queue.
2. There is now an explicit prompt for swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero, implemented in the `_check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method.

The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between the models and the game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, while all the game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

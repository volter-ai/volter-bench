## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that aligns with the architecture documents and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. Description of the fix:
To address the issue of not randomizing the order of skill execution when creatures have the same speed, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check to see if the speeds are equal, and if so, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first. This change will ensure that the resolution phase follows the logic described in the architecture document.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file, focusing on the `resolve_turn` method. Here's the updated file:

# Excerpt ID: c2e157c3-b97c-4b48-96c9-945047bed8ef
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            ])
            second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, second_defender = (
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
                if first_attacker == self.player else
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            )

            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender)
            if second_defender.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, second_defender)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by modifying the `resolve_turn` method to handle the case where creatures have equal speed. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first, as specified in the architecture document. This change ensures that the resolution phase follows the described logic, randomizing the order of skill execution when creatures have the same speed.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class while addressing the specific issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

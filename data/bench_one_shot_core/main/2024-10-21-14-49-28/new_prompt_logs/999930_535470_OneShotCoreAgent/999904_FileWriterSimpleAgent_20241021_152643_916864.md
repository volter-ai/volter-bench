## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to adjust the `execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to access the `attack` attribute on the `Player` object, which doesn't exist. Instead, we should be using the active creature's attributes for the battle calculations.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `MainGameScene` class, we'll modify the `execute_skill` method to use the active creature's attributes instead of the player's.
2. We'll update the `resolve_turn` method to pass the correct attacker and defender creatures.
3. We'll adjust the `determine_turn_order` method to return the correct creature objects instead of player objects.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: cb4f67db-72e1-4621-8752-3fb2be411aee
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_creature, player_skill, opponent_creature, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_creature, player_skill, opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_creature, player_skill, opponent_creature, opponent_skill):
        if player_creature.speed > opponent_creature.speed:
            return (player_creature, player_skill, opponent_creature), (opponent_creature, opponent_skill, player_creature)
        elif player_creature.speed < opponent_creature.speed:
            return (opponent_creature, opponent_skill, player_creature), (player_creature, player_skill, opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (player_creature, player_skill, opponent_creature), (opponent_creature, opponent_skill, player_creature)
            else:
                return (opponent_creature, opponent_skill, player_creature), (player_creature, player_skill, opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError by ensuring that we're using the correct Creature objects for battle calculations instead of the Player objects. The `execute_skill` method now takes Creature objects as parameters, and the `resolve_turn` and `determine_turn_order` methods have been updated accordingly.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the issue within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

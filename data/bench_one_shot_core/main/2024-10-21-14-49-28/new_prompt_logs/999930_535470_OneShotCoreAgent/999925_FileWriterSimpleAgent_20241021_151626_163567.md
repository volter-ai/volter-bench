## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`. We'll update the `battle_loop` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, we'll return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the `battle_loop` method, we'll check this return value and transition to the MainMenuScene if the battle has ended.
3. We'll also add a small delay after showing the battle result to give players time to read the message.

Here's the updated MainGameScene:

```

This updated version of the MainGameScene should resolve the issue by properly transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_quit_whole_game` or `_transition_to_scene`, which should fix the FixableException we were seeing in the test output.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

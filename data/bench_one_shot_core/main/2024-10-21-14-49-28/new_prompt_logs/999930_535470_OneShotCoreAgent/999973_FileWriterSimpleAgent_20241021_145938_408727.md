## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to ensure that the player's creatures' state is reset upon transitioning out of the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' state in the run method, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll create a helper method called reset_creatures that resets both the player's and opponent's creatures to their initial state.
3. We'll call this reset_creatures method at the end of the run method, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset before leaving the scene.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: a1f0151e-eb25-48ba-ac00-9bfcc0f00c67
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.opponent_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild opponent appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a reset_creatures method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP.
2. Calling the reset_creatures method at the end of the run method, just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes ensure that the player's creatures' state is reset upon transitioning out of the MainGameScene, as required by the architecture documentation. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

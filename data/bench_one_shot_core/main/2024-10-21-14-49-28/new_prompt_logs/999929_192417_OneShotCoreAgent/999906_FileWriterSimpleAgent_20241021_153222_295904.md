## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both discrepancies in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Equal Speed Handling:
   - In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
   - If speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly decide which creature goes first.

2. Normal Type Effectiveness:
   - We'll modify the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to explicitly handle the 'normal' type.
   - The 'normal' type will always return a factor of 1, regardless of the defender's type.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 691b9764-55c6-4262-bc70-8380b911ddb2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        while True:

            player_skill = self.player_turn()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
        
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button])
        
        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            return skill_choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, skill_choices)
        return skill_choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

            first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first, second = (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            else:
                first, second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

        self.execute_skill(*first, second[1])

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        
        weakness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return weakness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `resolve_turn` method now handles the case where creatures have equal speed by using `random.choice` to decide which creature goes first.

2. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'normal' type, always returning a factor of 1 for normal-type skills.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture and handles all cases correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address both the missing 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase and the need to reset the state of the player's creatures upon leaving the MainGameScene. Here's how I'll fix these issues:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:
   - Add a 'Back' button to the attack and swap choices.
   - Implement a loop in the player_choice_phase method to allow returning to the main choice when 'Back' is selected.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures upon leaving the MainGameScene:
   - Add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp.
   - Call this method in the run method after the battle is over, before quitting the game.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 09983646-98be-40d1-88cd-ca6f699dc5ea

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.battle_over = False

    def __str__(self):

            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the attack and swap choice phases. Players can return to the main choice if they select 'Back'.
2. A new method `reset_creatures_state()` is added to reset all creatures' HP to their maximum value. This method is called at the end of the battle, just before quitting the game.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

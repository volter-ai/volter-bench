## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not being exited in an expected manner in the random run test.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until the player chooses to quit or transition.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: d496d89f-06ae-4126-8de8-923e4f27d0fa
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill = None
        self.opponent_skill = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while True:
            self.game_loop()
            if not self.play_again():
                break

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill = choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        self.opponent_skill = choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[0])
        if second[0].hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[0])

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player_creature, self.player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_skill), (self.player_creature, self.player_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            # Reset the battle
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
            return True
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return False
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Wrapping the main game loop in another loop that checks if the player wants to play again after each battle.
2. Adding a `play_again` method that prompts the player to choose between playing again or quitting.
3. If the player chooses to play again, we reset the creatures' HP and start a new battle.
4. If the player chooses to quit, we call `self._quit_whole_game()` to properly exit the game.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits either by transitioning to another scene (in this case, implicitly back to itself for a new battle) or by quitting the whole game. This should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the random run test failing due to unexpected scene termination.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `_choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `_choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering the choice.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return `None` instead of calling `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list.
3. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, we'll handle the case where `_choose_swap` returns `None` by forcing the player to choose an attack instead.

Here's the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `_choose_swap` method to return `None` when there are no available creatures to swap to.
2. Updating the `_player_choice_phase` method to handle the case where `_choose_swap` returns `None`, forcing the player to choose an attack instead.

These changes ensure that we never call `_wait_for_choice` with an empty list of choices, which was causing the AssertionError. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

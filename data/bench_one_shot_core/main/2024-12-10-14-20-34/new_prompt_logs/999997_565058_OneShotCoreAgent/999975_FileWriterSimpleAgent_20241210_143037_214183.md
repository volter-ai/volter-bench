Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is a NameError because `uuid` is not imported in main.py. This is a simple import issue that can be fixed by adding the import statement at the top of main.py.

The fix is straightforward - we just need to add the import statement while keeping all the existing architecture and models intact. This won't affect any of the guidelines since it's just adding a missing import.

2. Here's the fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: fc62be21-17f2-4861-8317-060aca87bd07
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

This fix:
1. Adds the missing uuid import
2. Maintains all the existing functionality
3. Keeps the models as pure data schemas
4. Preserves the inheritance structure
5. Doesn't modify any other architectural aspects

The error should now be resolved while staying within all the guidelines and capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

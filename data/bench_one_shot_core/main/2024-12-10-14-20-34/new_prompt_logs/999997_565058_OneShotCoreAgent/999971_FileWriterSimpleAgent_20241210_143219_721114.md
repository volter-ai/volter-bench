Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is that we're not resetting creature states when leaving the MainGameScene. According to the architecture docs, we need to "reset the state of the player's creatures" when leaving the scene.

Looking at the models:
- Creatures have hp and max_hp attributes
- We need to reset hp to max_hp when leaving
- This should be done in the scene, not in the models (since models are pure data schemas)
- We can add this reset in MainGameScene before any scene transition or game end

The fix will be in main_game_scene.py, where we'll:
1. Create a helper method to reset creatures
2. Call it before any scene exit
3. Apply it to both player and bot creatures

Here's the complete fixed file:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `reset_creatures_state()` method to handle resetting
2. Added a try/finally block in run() to ensure reset happens even if there's an error
3. Reset is called when leaving the scene for any reason
4. Keeps models as pure data schemas by implementing this in the scene

This maintains all architectural requirements while fixing the missing reset functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue requires two fixes in MainGameScene:

a) Add "Back" option:
- Add a back button in the skill/creature selection menus
- Return to main action menu when back is selected
- Use the engine's Button class for the back option

b) Reset creature state on scene exit:
- Add a reset_creatures method to restore initial HP
- Call it before _quit_whole_game
- Use the prototype data to get original HP values
- Keep models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button functionality:
   - Modified get_player_action to use a while loop
   - Added back button to skill and creature choices
   - Return to main menu when back is selected

2. Added creature state reset:
   - Added reset_creatures method
   - Called reset_creatures before each _quit_whole_game
   - Uses from_prototype_id to get original stats
   - Maintains pure data model architecture

This implementation:
- Follows the engine architecture
- Keeps models as pure data schemas
- Uses engine capabilities for UI/flow control
- Implements all required features from docs
- Properly handles state cleanup

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

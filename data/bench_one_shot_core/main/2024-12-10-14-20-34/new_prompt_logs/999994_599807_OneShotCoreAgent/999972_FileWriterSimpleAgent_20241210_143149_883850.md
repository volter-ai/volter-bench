Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's just returning from the run() method instead of transitioning to another scene or calling quit_whole_game. According to the engine's architecture, scenes must explicitly end via transition or quit.

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to:
1. Call _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends (when check_battle_end() returns True)
2. Never return directly from run()
3. Keep the game loop running until explicitly ended via _quit_whole_game()

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a02129e8-8f41-4108-ab79-5c98c954e387

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls before each return in the run() method
2. This ensures the scene properly ends via the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning
3. The scene will now properly signal completion to the engine

This follows the engine architecture by:
- Using proper scene termination methods
- Maintaining pure data models
- Keeping all game logic in scenes
- Using the engine's built-in mechanisms for scene flow control

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but getting an empty list. This happens when all creatures are either knocked out or already active. We need to handle this case properly.

The fix involves:
1. Only showing the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Checking for available creatures before offering swap choice
3. Handling forced swaps when active creature is knocked out

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        # Initialize creatures

```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_creatures` helper method to check for valid swap targets
2. Added `handle_forced_swap` method to handle knocked out creatures
3. Only show "Swap" option if there are available creatures
4. Check for knocked out creatures at start of each turn
5. Only execute second attack if it's a skill (not a swap)
6. Updated string representation to only show swap option when available

These changes ensure we never try to offer an empty list of choices while maintaining all the game mechanics and following the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

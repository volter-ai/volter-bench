Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is breaking from its game loop without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
1. `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene, or 
2. `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

In our case, when the battle ends (win or lose), we should transition back to the MainMenuScene. We also need to reset creature HP when leaving the battle scene.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `end_battle` method to handle battle completion
2. Modified `check_battle_end` to return the winner
3. Added HP reset when battle ends
4. Added transition back to MainMenuScene
5. Removed direct returns/breaks from game loop
6. All scene exits now properly use `_transition_to_scene`

This maintains the engine's architecture requirements while fixing the scene transition issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

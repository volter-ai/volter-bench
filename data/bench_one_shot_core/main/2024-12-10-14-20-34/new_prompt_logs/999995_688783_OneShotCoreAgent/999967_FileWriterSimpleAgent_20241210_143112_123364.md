Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene's check_battle_end() method just returns True when the battle ends, which causes the run() method to break from its loop without properly ending the scene. According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end by either:
- Transitioning to another scene using _transition_to_scene()
- Ending the game using _quit_whole_game()

The fix:
When the battle ends (either win or loss), we should call _quit_whole_game() to properly end the game. This follows the engine's scene transition requirements and maintains clean architecture.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the return True/False from check_battle_end()
2. Added _quit_whole_game() calls when the battle ends
3. Removed the break from the run() loop since _quit_whole_game() will handle ending the scene
4. Maintained all game logic while properly following the engine's scene transition requirements

This solution ensures the scene always ends properly through the engine's supported methods while maintaining the game's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

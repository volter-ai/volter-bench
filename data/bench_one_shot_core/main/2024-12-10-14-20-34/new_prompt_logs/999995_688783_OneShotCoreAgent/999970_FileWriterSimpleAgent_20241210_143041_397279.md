Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference `player_action` which is not defined in scope. The issue is that we're trying to determine if the current action belongs to the player or bot by comparing it to a variable that doesn't exist.

The fix:
Instead of comparing the whole action tuple, we should pass in the owner of the action along with the action itself when executing. We'll modify the resolve_actions method to pass tuples of (action, owner) when calling execute_action. This maintains clean separation of concerns and stays within the engine's capabilities.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Modified resolve_actions to take tuples of (action, owner)
2. Updated get_action_order to work with these tuples
3. Changed execute_action to take both action and owner as parameters
4. Removed the problematic comparison with player_action
5. Maintained all the game logic while fixing the scoping issue

This solution keeps the architecture clean and maintains separation between models and game logic while fixing the NameError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

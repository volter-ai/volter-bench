Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to access self.player_action which doesn't exist. The issue is in the logic for determining the attacker - we're comparing the entire action dictionary to self.player_action instead of storing and comparing the actions properly.

The fix involves:
1. Storing the player and opponent actions as instance variables when they're created
2. Using these stored actions to determine the attacker in execute_action
3. Not comparing entire action dictionaries, but rather checking if the action is the player's action

This stays within engine capabilities and doesn't affect the models or architecture. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added instance variables current_player_action and current_opponent_action
2. Store actions when they're created in run()
3. Changed execute_action to use identity comparison (is) against stored actions
4. Removed reference to non-existent self.player_action

This should fix the AttributeError while maintaining the game's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

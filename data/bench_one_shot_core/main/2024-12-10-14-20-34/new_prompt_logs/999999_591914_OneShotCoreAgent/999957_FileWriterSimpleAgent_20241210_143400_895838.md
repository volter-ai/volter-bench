Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
- The issue is that we need to reset creature states when leaving the MainGameScene
- According to the docs, we need to "reset the state of the player's creatures" when leaving the scene
- Since models can't have methods, we'll need to handle this in the scene
- We can create a new method in MainGameScene to reset creatures to their prototype state
- We'll use create_from_game_database to get fresh creature instances
- We'll call this reset when the battle ends, before quitting

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            self._quit_whole_game()
```

Key changes:
1. Added reset_creatures_state method to handle resetting creatures
2. Used create_from_game_database to get fresh creature instances
3. Called reset_creatures_state for both players before ending the scene
4. Added import for create_from_game_database
5. Reset active_creature to None after resetting creatures

This implementation:
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Maintains models as pure data schemas
- Properly resets creature state when leaving the scene
- Preserves all other functionality

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

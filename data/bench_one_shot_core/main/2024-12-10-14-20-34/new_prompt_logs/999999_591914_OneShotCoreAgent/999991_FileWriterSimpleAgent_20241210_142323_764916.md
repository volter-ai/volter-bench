Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. In the MainGameScene, when a battle ends, we call _quit_whole_game(), but in the test we need to catch this exception just like we do in the MainMenuScene test.

The solution is to modify the test_main_game_scene.py file to properly catch the _QuitWholeGame exception. We should also patch the _quit_whole_game method similar to how we did in the menu scene test, so we can verify the game ended properly.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 30338ca9-c941-4a2a-8f9e-8467d2d627fc
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random_mode_counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
                else:
                    # Verify that the game ended through _quit_whole_game
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game should have ended with _quit_whole_game"
                    print("_quit_whole_game called - battle ended normally")
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This fix:
1. Adds proper exception handling for the game end condition
2. Patches the _quit_whole_game method to prevent the exception from propagating
3. Verifies that the game ended properly through the quit method
4. Maintains all architectural constraints and doesn't require changes to the models or scene logic

The test will now pass while still verifying that battles end properly through the quit mechanism.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

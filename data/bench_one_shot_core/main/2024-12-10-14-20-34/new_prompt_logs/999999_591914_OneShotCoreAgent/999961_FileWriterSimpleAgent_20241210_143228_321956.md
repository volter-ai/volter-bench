Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test failures indicate two related problems:
- MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting
- The scene's game loop is using direct returns instead of proper scene transitions

The fix needs to:
1. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends instead of returning
2. Remove all direct returns from the game loop
3. Maintain proper flow control using the scene transition mechanisms
4. Stay within engine capabilities by using proper scene lifecycle methods

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            self.battle_ended = True
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

Key changes:
1. Added battle_ended flag to control game loop
2. Removed direct returns from run()
3. Changed check_battle_end to call _quit_whole_game() instead of returning
4. Improved action handling flow to avoid direct returns
5. Made get_player_action return boolean for flow control
6. Added proper back button handling in choice methods

These changes ensure the scene properly ends using engine mechanisms while maintaining the same game logic and staying within engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

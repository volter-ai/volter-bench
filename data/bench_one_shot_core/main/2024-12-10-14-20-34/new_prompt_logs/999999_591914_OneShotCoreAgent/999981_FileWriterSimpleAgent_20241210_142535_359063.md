Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we see it properly handles both scene transitions and game quits. We should follow the same pattern for the main game scene test, patching both _quit_whole_game and _transition_to_scene methods and catching their exceptions.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 08363bd6-98f6-4cc0-ac98-6ad7c926082a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transition occurred in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("Game ended via _quit_whole_game")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("Game ended via _transition_to_scene")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This solution:
1. Follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py
2. Properly catches and handles both scene transitions and game quits
3. Maintains test coverage while preventing the _QuitWholeGame exception from causing test failures
4. Provides helpful debug output about how the scene ended
5. Properly cleans up mocks between test iterations

The test will now pass while still verifying that the game scene properly ends either through transition or quitting.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill - Has base_damage
- Creature - Has hp, max_hp, attack, defense, speed, and a collection of skills
- Player - Has a collection of creatures (already partially implemented)

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json - Define the "tackle" skill
- creature.json - Define "Bubwool" and "Scizard" creatures
- player.json - Define "default_player" and "basic_opponent" players

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene - Already exists but needs updating to transition to MainGameScene
- MainGameScene - Implements the battle logic with phases

4. Create tests for both scenes using random mode testing

Key considerations:
- Models will be pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing
- Models will reference other models directly, not by ID
- Scene logic will handle all game mechanics
- Will use _wait_for_choice and _show_text for both human and bot players
- Will use create_bot for opponent creation
- Will use from_prototype_id for model creation

Let me implement each file:

This implementation follows all the guidelines and creates a working creature battler game where:
1. Players start at the main menu and can choose to play or quit
2. In battle, players and bots take turns choosing skills
3. Damage is calculated based on attack, defense and skill damage
4. Speed determines turn order
5. Battle continues until one creature's HP reaches zero
6. The game properly handles both human and bot players
7. All models are pure data schemas
8. All scene logic is contained in the scenes
9. Proper testing is implemented for random runs

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because _quit_whole_game() raises an exception that needs to be caught in the test. The test should handle both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions, since both are valid ways for the scene to end (either by reaching the random move limit or by completing a battle).

2. Fix:
I'll rewrite the test_main_game_scene.py file to catch both exceptions. This is the correct approach because:
- It maintains the engine's architecture (scenes should use _quit_whole_game to end)
- It doesn't require changes to the models
- It follows the pattern shown in test_main_menu_scene.py where we catch scene exit conditions

# Excerpt ID: 483de6fe-bcd2-469e-b64a-c40fb79cc8e5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed normally in run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Catches both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Prints appropriate messages for both exit conditions
4. Maintains the test's purpose of ensuring the scene runs without errors
5. Follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py for handling scene exits

The MainGameScene itself is working correctly by using _quit_whole_game() to end the battle - we just needed to properly catch its exception in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

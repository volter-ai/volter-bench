Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the randomization of skill execution order when both creatures have the same speed in the MainGameScene. This aligns with the architecture description that states: "If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the MainGameScene class.
2. We'll add a check to see if the speeds are equal, and if so, use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this random order when speeds are equal.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models. It only affects the game logic within the MainGameScene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where both creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. This aligns with the architecture description and should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

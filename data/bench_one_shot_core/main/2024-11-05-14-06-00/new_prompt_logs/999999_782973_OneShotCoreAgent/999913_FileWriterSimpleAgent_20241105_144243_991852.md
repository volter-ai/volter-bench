Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the resetting of the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. This is a required feature that we overlooked in the previous implementation.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the state of both the player's and opponent's creatures.
2. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already correctly implemented as pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 87d097b5-3914-4e2c-87be-0b1f5b4a7d4b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                # Reset creature states
                self.reset_creature_states()
                # Transition back to the main menu
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creature_states(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
```

This implementation adds the `reset_creature_states` method, which resets the HP of all creatures (both player's and opponent's) to their maximum values. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the battle scene.

This change addresses the issue raised in the QA testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and we've only modified the scene logic to include the required state reset.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

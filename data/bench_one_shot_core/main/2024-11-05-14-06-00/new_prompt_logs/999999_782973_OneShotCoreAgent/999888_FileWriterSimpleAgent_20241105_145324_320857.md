Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that we're not implementing the random selection for equal speeds in the resolution phase, as specified in the architecture documentation. To fix this, we need to modify the `_resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll modify the sorting key in the `_resolve_turn` method to include a random factor when speeds are equal.
2. We'll use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random float between 0 and 1 for each action in the turn queue.
3. The sorting key will now consider the action type (swap or attack), the creature's speed, and this random factor.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0096c2a0-aa1c-4729-999b-fb414f08dd21

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing the random selection for equal speeds in the resolution phase. The key changes are in the `_resolve_turn` method:

1. We add a random factor to each action in the turn queue.
2. We sort the turn queue considering the action type (swap or attack), the creature's speed, and the random factor.
3. In case of equal speeds, the random factor will determine the order, as required by the architecture documentation.

These changes ensure that when creatures have equal speed, the order of their actions is randomly determined, adhering to the game logic described in the documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

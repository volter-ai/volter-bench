Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the missing `active_creature` field in the Player model. The error occurs because the `Player` class expects an `active_creature` attribute, but it's not being set when creating a player from the prototype.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional. This way, we can create a Player instance without immediately setting an active creature.

2. We'll update the `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: d19700a9-9576-4e1d-ac4f-a959a458dde1
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional, allowing us to create a Player instance without immediately setting an active creature. The `active_creature` will be set when the battle is initialized in the `MainGameScene`.

Now, we need to update the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` at the start of the battle:

# Excerpt ID: 7a151005-3e56-42e4-86ed-8ffc326235e0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name if player_creature else 'No active creature'}: HP {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp if player_creature else 0}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {opponent_creature.display_name if opponent_creature else 'No active creature'}: HP {opponent_creature.hp}/{opponent_creature.max_hp if opponent_creature else 0}

> Attack
> Swap
"""

    def run(self):
        self._initialize_battle()
        while True:
            self._player_turn(self.player)
            self._player_turn(self.opponent)
            self._resolve_turn()
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
        self._end_battle()

    def _initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

These changes should resolve the ValidationError we were encountering. The `Player` model now allows for an optional `active_creature`, and the `MainGameScene` sets the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

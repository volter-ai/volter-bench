Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the previous implementation. Let's address this issue by modifying the MainGameScene to properly handle creatures with the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we will:
   - Modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the MainGameScene class.
   - Add a check to compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll implement a random choice to determine which creature goes first.
   - This change will align with the architecture description and ensure that the game logic is fully implemented as required.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e5414848-e5c6-49e7-b080-40e3eb8e43ab
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _handle_battle_end(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to properly handle cases where creatures have the same speed.
2. Using `random.choice([True, False])` to randomly determine which creature attacks first when their speeds are equal.
3. Adding appropriate text messages to inform the player about which creature attacks first in case of equal speeds.

These changes ensure that the game logic fully aligns with the architecture description, including the handling of creatures with the same speed. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture without modifying the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

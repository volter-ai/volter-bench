Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended and who won.
3. We'll update the main game loop to break and transition to the appropriate scene when the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. The main game loop now breaks when the battle ends, and we've added an `_end_battle` method to handle the transition and reset the creatures' HP.

This solution adheres to the engine's architecture and capabilities, and it doesn't modify any models. It should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing by ensuring that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test setup for MainGameScene. The test is failing because:
- When MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, MainMenuScene quits the game
- The test isn't properly set up to catch scene transitions
- We need to mock both possible exits (transition and quit) like in the MainMenuScene test

The solution is to:
- Update the test to properly catch both scene transitions and game quits
- Follow the same pattern used in test_main_menu_scene.py
- Use patch to catch both exit conditions
- This maintains the engine's architecture and doesn't require changes to the models

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 9e51395a-022d-44f3-8cfa-2656f21b5e67
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both possible ways of exiting the scene
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
                    # Reset creature HP for next iteration
                    player.creatures[0].hp = player.creatures[0].max_hp
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper mocking of both exit conditions
2. Added TransitionFromScene exception handling
3. Added assertions to verify scene exits properly
4. Maintained proper cleanup between iterations
5. Kept HP reset for creatures

This follows the same pattern as the MainMenuScene test and should now run successfully while maintaining the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

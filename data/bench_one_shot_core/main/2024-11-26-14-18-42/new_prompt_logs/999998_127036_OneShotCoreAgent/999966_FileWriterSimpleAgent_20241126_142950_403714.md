Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to compare the current action with self.player_action, but player_action isn't stored as a class attribute. We need to store the actions when we get them in the run method, so they're available during execution.

The fix involves:
- Storing the player and bot actions as class attributes in the run method
- Using these stored actions in execute_action to determine the attacker/defender
- Not modifying any models or core architecture
- Staying within engine capabilities

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added current_player_action and current_bot_action as class attributes
2. Store actions when they're made in the run method
3. Use stored actions in execute_action to determine attacker/defender
4. Maintained all architectural requirements and engine capabilities
5. No changes to models or other components needed

This should resolve the AttributeError while maintaining proper game functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

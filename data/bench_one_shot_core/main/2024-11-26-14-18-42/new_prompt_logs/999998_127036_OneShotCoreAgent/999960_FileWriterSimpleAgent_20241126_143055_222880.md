Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or loss), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()`. According to the engine requirements, scenes must always end with either a transition or quit.

The fix involves:
- Modifying MainGameScene's check_battle_end method to call _quit_whole_game instead of returning True
- No changes needed to models or architecture
- Stays within engine capabilities by using proper scene exit methods
- Maintains all game logic and flow

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            self._quit_whole_game()
```

Key changes:
1. Modified check_battle_end to call _quit_whole_game instead of returning True
2. Removed break from run method's loop since _quit_whole_game will handle exiting
3. No changes to models or core architecture
4. Maintains engine requirements by properly ending scenes
5. Preserves all game logic and functionality

This should resolve the FixableException while maintaining proper game functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

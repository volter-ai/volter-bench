Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs when trying to get choices for swapping creatures when a bot's creature is knocked out. The issue is in get_player_action where we're not handling the case where there are no available creatures to swap to. This violates the engine's requirement that _wait_for_choice must always have choices.

The fix needs to:
- Check if there are available creatures before creating swap choices
- Only offer the "Swap" button if there are creatures to swap to
- Stay within engine capabilities by always providing valid choices
- Maintain pure data models
- Keep all game logic in scenes

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added get_available_creatures helper method to centralize creature availability logic
2. Modified get_player_action to only show "Swap" option if there are available creatures
3. Updated handle_knockout to use get_available_creatures
4. Added note about swap availability in scene's __str__ output

This maintains the engine's requirements while fixing the empty choices issue. The models remain pure data schemas and all game logic stays in the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or lose), it just breaks from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: In MainGameScene, after showing the win/loss message, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: d3b74ab5-f471-4557-b6a2-786dad8ac2cc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()

                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game after battle conclusion

    def _handle_player_turn(self):

            ]
            random.shuffle(participants)
            first, second = participants

        # Execute skills in order
        for attacker, attacker_creature, skill in [first, second]:
            if attacker == self.player:
                defender = self.opponent
                defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
            else:

            damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {damage} damage!")

            if defender_creature.hp == 0:
                break

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now properly end the game with `self._quit_whole_game()` after the battle concludes. This ensures we follow the engine's requirement that scenes must always end with a proper transition or game end.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

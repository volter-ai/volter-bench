Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's execute_action method where it tries to reference `player_action` which is not in scope. The issue is that we're trying to determine if the current action belongs to the player or bot by comparing it to a variable that doesn't exist.

The fix is to modify the execute_action method to take an additional parameter indicating which player the action belongs to, rather than trying to compare the action itself. This maintains clean architecture because:
- No changes needed to models
- Game logic remains in scenes
- No additional state tracking needed
- Follows the engine's capabilities

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added is_player_action parameter to execute_action
2. Modified resolve_turn to pass the correct is_player_action value
3. Removed reliance on comparing actions directly to determine ownership

This maintains clean architecture while fixing the NameError issue. The scene still handles all game logic, models remain pure data schemas, and we're working within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or quit the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends, which is incorrect. We should:
1. After showing the battle result, transition back to MainMenuScene if the player wants to play again
2. Or quit the game if they don't want to play again

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 619ddbba-0db1-4a8b-a688-20ac57f24455
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} (DMG: {skill.damage})" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot phase  
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # After battle ends, ask player what to do next
                play_again = Button("Play Again")
                quit_game = Button("Quit")
                choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, quit_game])
                
                if choice == play_again:
                    # Reset creature states before transitioning
                    self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                    self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                else:
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.player_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. After battle ends, we now present the player with a choice to play again or quit
2. If they choose to play again:
   - Reset creature HP to max
   - Transition back to MainMenuScene
3. If they choose to quit:
   - Call _quit_whole_game()
4. Both paths properly exit the scene through engine-approved methods

This should resolve both test failures since the scene now properly exits through either transition or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene's _resolve_turn method when calling _execute_skill. The error shows we're passing 6 arguments but the method only accepts 5.

Looking at the code:
# Excerpt ID: 45908f2d-e8d0-41fb-b7e6-f92bd06f1b87
```python
first = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_chosen_skill)
second = (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, self.opponent_chosen_skill)
self._execute_skill(*first, *second[1:])
```

The issue is that we're unpacking both tuples incorrectly. When we do `*first, *second[1:]`, we're passing:
- player (from first)
- player_creature (from first) 
- player_chosen_skill (from first)
- opponent_creature (from second[1:])
- opponent_chosen_skill (from second[1:])
- opponent_creature (again from second[1:])

The fix is to adjust how we unpack the arguments to match the method signature. We should only pass:
- attacker
- attacker_creature
- skill
- defender_creature

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 4cecd6fb-4f43-4f46-8b22-2b63e73e8400
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

        self._execute_skill(self.player, *first)
        if second[2].hp > 0:  # Only execute second move if target still alive
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, *second)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        # Calculate type multiplier
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        
        # Calculate final damage
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        # Show result
        effectiveness = "It's super effective!" if multiplier > 1 else "It's not very effective..." if multiplier < 1 else ""
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Dealt {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Simplified the tuples in _resolve_turn to only contain the creature, skill and target
2. Pass the attacker player separately to _execute_skill
3. Fixed the argument unpacking to match the method signature

This maintains all the engine capabilities and model architecture while fixing the argument passing issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

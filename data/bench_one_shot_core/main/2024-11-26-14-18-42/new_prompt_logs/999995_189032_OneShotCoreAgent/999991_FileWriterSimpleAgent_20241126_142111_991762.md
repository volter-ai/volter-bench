Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me describe the fix:

1. According to the docs, we need to reset creature state when exiting MainGameScene. Since models must be pure data schemas without methods, we can't add reset methods there.

2. The solution is to handle this in the MainGameScene by resetting the hp of all creatures back to their max_hp before quitting. This keeps the logic in the scene while maintaining pure data models.

3. We'll do this right before calling _quit_whole_game() in the MainGameScene.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 88972b74-c867-454e-8139-b0325da7b54c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} (DMG: {skill.damage})" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot phase  
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Reset creature states before exiting
                self._reset_creature_states()
                self._quit_whole_game()

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.player_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creature_states(self):
        """Reset all creatures to their initial state before exiting"""
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution:
1. Maintains pure data models
2. Keeps all game logic in the scene
3. Properly resets creature states before exiting
4. Follows the engine's architecture
5. Meets the requirement from the documentation

The fix adds a _reset_creature_states method to the scene that resets all creatures' HP to their max_hp before exiting. This ensures creatures are ready for the next battle if the game were to continue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene isn't properly exiting - it needs to either transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle ends. Currently, it just breaks from the loop without calling either exit method.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, after showing the win/loss message, we should call _quit_whole_game() to properly end the game. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly exit either through transition or quitting.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: ba62ab92-e3df-469b-b8e1-e619b5860c67
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} (DMG: {skill.damage})" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild trainer appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot phase  
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly exit the game after battle ends

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.player_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        if self.bot_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        return False
```

This change ensures that:
1. The scene properly exits when the battle ends
2. The tests will pass since we're now calling _quit_whole_game()
3. We maintain the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly exit
4. We keep all the game logic within the scene
5. We don't modify any models or architecture

The fix is minimal but addresses the core issue - the scene wasn't properly exiting according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When a battle ends, the scene calls _quit_whole_game() which raises this exception. In the test, we need to catch this exception as an expected outcome, similar to how we handle RandomModeGracefulExit.

The fix is simple: we need to modify the test_main_game_scene.py file to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in addition to RandomModeGracefulExit. This is the expected behavior when a battle concludes.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 252f469e-929f-4d4e-aa7f-bfa583e800ef
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle concluded normally, ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Adds an except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Prints a message indicating the battle concluded normally

The fix stays within the engine's capabilities and doesn't require any changes to the models or core game logic. It simply properly handles the expected game termination condition in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

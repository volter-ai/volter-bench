Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects when checking for "Back" choices. This is incorrect because SelectThing wraps the actual thing (skill or creature) and doesn't have a display_name itself.

Looking at the engine code, SelectThing has a `select_action_type` and `thing` property. We should:

1. Check if the choice is a Button (for "Back") vs SelectThing (for skills/creatures)
2. Use isinstance() to differentiate between Button and SelectThing
3. Keep the models as pure data schemas
4. Stay within the engine's capabilities

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Changed `choice.display_name == "Back"` checks to `isinstance(choice, Button)`
2. Removed direct access to SelectThing.display_name
3. Kept all model references using the thing property of SelectThing
4. Maintained pure data schema approach for models

This should fix the AttributeError while maintaining the proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

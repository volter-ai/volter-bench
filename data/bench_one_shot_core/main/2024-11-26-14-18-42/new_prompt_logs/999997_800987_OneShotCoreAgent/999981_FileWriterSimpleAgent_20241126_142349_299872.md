Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because `_quit_whole_game()` raises an exception that needs to be caught in the test. Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py, we see that it properly catches scene transitions and quits. We need to modify test_main_game_scene.py to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception, similar to how test_main_menu_scene.py catches TransitionFromScene.

The fix is to:
1. Add proper exception handling in test_main_game_scene.py
2. Mock _quit_whole_game() like we do in test_main_menu_scene.py
3. Assert that the scene ended properly via quit or transition

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: f5010a0e-6304-486d-ba92-153971e84a06
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Mock both possible ways to exit the scene
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print("Game quit gracefully")
                else:
                    # Assert that we exited the scene by quitting (since this scene only ends via quit)
                    assert mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited via quit"
                    print("_quit_whole_game called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added mocking of _quit_whole_game
3. Added assertions to verify the scene ended properly
4. Added proper cleanup in finally block

This maintains the architecture and capabilities of the engine while properly testing the scene's behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

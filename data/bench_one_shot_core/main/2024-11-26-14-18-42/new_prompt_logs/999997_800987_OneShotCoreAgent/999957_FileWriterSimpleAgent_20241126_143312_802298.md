Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to show creature swap choices but getting an empty list. This happens when all creatures are either knocked out or already active. We need to:

1. Only show the swap option if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Handle the case where a player has no valid moves (all creatures knocked out) by ending the battle
3. Check for battle end conditions before getting player/bot actions

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `get_available_creatures()` helper method
2. Modified `get_turn_action()` to only show valid choices
3. Added null check for when no valid actions are available
4. Check battle end conditions before each turn
5. Return None from get_turn_action when no valid moves exist
6. Only show Attack option if active creature has HP
7. Only show Swap option if valid creatures exist to swap to

This should prevent the empty choices error while maintaining proper game flow and battle mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

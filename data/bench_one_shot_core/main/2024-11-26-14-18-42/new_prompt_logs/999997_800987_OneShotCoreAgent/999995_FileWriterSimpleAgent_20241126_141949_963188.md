Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set `creature.hp = creature.max_hp` in the scene

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 9d0413f2-198c-40a4-ae34-7e64613f9310
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations

from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    damage: int
    description: str = ""

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    hp: int
    max_hp: int  
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

# Excerpt ID: 60639e8b-59a3-4ba2-b26f-eea1f4db730d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot phase
            bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._cleanup_and_exit()
                return
                
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._cleanup_and_exit()
                return

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player: Player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _cleanup_and_exit(self):
        # Reset creatures to max HP
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. In MainGameScene._cleanup_and_exit(), directly set hp = max_hp instead of calling reset()
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while following the architectural constraints of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

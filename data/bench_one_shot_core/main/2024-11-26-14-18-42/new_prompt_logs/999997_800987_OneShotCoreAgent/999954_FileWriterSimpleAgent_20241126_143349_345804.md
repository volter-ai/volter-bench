Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's breaking from the game loop without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:

1. `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
2. `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game entirely

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:

1. When the battle ends (win or lose), transition back to the MainMenuScene
2. Make sure to properly handle all end conditions by calling _transition_to_scene()
3. Remove direct breaks/returns from the game loop

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:

1. Modified check_battle_end() to return True/False/None to indicate win/loss/continue
2. Added proper scene transitions after battle ends
3. Always transition back to MainMenuScene when battle is over
4. Removed direct breaks from the game loop
5. Added proper return statements after transitions
6. Made sure all end conditions lead to a scene transition

This should fix both test failures by ensuring the scene always ends with a proper transition.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

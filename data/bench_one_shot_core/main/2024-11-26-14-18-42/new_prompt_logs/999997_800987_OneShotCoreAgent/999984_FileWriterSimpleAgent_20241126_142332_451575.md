Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, every scene must end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: In MainGameScene, when the battle ends (either win or lose), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` instead of breaking from the loop.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 0ba7c94a-d323-4b85-bd24-0d3b91e364cc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.phase = "player_choice"
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

        self.queued_bot_skill = None

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self.phase = "player_choice"
            choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            self.queued_player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing

            # Bot choice phase

    def resolve_turn(self):
        first = self.player
        second = self.bot
        first_skill = self.queued_player_skill
        second_skill = self.queued_bot_skill
        
        # Speed check
        if self.bot_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed or \
           (self.bot_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
            first, second = second, first

        if second_skill and (self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.bot_creature.hp > 0):
            self.execute_skill(second_skill,
                             self.player_creature if second == self.player else self.bot_creature,

    def execute_skill(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense

        # Get type effectiveness
        factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        # Calculate final damage
        final_damage = int(factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        # Show result
        effectiveness = "It's super effective!" if factor > 1 else "It's not very effective..." if factor < 1 else ""
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key change is replacing the `break` statements with `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

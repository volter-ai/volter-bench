Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the expected `_QuitWholeGame` exception that gets raised when the battle ends. According to the engine's design, this is the expected behavior - the game should end with this exception and it should be caught.

Looking at the other test files (like test_main_menu_scene.py), we can see that they properly handle both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and scene transitions. We need to modify test_main_game_scene.py to:
1. Catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception as an expected end state
2. Keep the existing `RandomModeGracefulExit` catch for when the random counter expires
3. Print appropriate messages for debugging

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 0a0b8dcb-0268-4dd3-b668-8c665c509a7e
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit,
    AbstractApp
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Battle completed normally in run {i}")
            else:
                pytest.fail("Scene ended without expected transition or game end")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access `_QuitWholeGame`
2. Added exception handler for `_QuitWholeGame`
3. Added explicit fail if neither expected exception is raised
4. Improved debug messages to distinguish between different end states

This fix:
- Maintains the engine's architecture where games end via exceptions
- Properly tests both possible end conditions (random mode timeout and battle completion)
- Keeps the test running through all 10 iterations
- Stays within the engine's capabilities
- Doesn't require changes to the models or game logic

The test will now pass since it properly handles the game's end state exception.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

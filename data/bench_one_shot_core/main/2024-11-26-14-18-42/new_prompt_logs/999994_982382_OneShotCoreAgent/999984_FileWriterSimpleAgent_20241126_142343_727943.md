Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine architecture (looking at test_main_menu_scene.py), we should:

- Patch both exit methods (_quit_whole_game and _transition_to_scene)
- Catch the expected exceptions
- Verify that one of the exit methods was called

This matches how the MainMenuScene test works, which is passing. We need to rewrite test_main_game_scene.py to follow the same pattern.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ea8d5a22-c355-4395-a346-b81b2becab60
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both exit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    # important to print how we exited the scene, for debug purposes
                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
- Added proper exception handling for both exit methods
- Added mocking of both _transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game
- Added assertions to verify the scene exits properly
- Added debug printing to help track scene exit methods
- Follows the same pattern as the working MainMenuScene test

This maintains the same test coverage but properly handles the engine's scene exit mechanisms, allowing the test to pass while verifying the scene's behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

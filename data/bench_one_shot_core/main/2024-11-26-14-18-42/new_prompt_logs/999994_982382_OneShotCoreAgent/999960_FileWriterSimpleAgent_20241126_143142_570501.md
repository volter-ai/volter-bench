Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or loss), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Or ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is to:
1. Remove the break statements
2. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends (win or loss)
3. Ensure we properly handle creature HP resets before ending

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `end_battle()` method to properly clean up and quit
2. Modified `check_battle_end()` to return the winner
3. Removed break statements and replaced with proper returns
4. Added HP reset before quitting
5. Always end with `_quit_whole_game()` when battle concludes

This should resolve the scene termination issue while maintaining proper game flow and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the explicit resetting of the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a new method `reset_creatures_state` to the `MainGameScene` class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the bot, resetting their HP to their max HP.
3. We'll call this method in the `check_battle_end` method, just before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The changes will be confined to the game logic within the `MainGameScene` class.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding the `reset_creatures_state` method, which resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum values. This method is called in the `check_battle_end` method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and do not modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The modifications are confined to the game logic within the `MainGameScene` class, as required.

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address these concerns and rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to fix the problems. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when speeds are equal.
2. Remove the minimum damage of 1, as it wasn't specified in the architecture.
3. Update the weakness factor calculation to handle cases where a skill type is neither effective nor ineffective against a creature type.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 37ab1f3f-2637-480f-a485-6b57df49365a

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Random decision-making for skill execution order when speeds are equal is now implemented in the `resolution_phase` method.
2. The minimum damage of 1 has been removed from the `execute_skill` method.
3. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now handles cases where a skill type is neither effective nor ineffective against a creature type by returning 1 as the default case.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA testing while adhering to the original architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

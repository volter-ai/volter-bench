## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Remove the maximum number of turns and draw handling, as these are not specified in the architecture.
2. Remove any state resetting of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene, as this is not specified in the architecture.

These changes will bring the implementation in line with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the models as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The maximum number of turns and draw handling have been removed, as they were not specified in the architecture.
2. Any state resetting of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene has been removed, as it was not specified in the architecture.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and do not alter any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The changes are confined to the game logic within the `MainGameScene` class, as required by the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

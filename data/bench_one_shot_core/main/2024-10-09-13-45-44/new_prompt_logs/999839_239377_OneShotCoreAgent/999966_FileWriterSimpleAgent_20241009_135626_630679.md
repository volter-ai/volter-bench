## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random resolution for equal speed:
   - When creatures have equal speed, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to determine which goes first.

2. Enforce forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   - After each skill execution, we'll check if the defender's HP is zero and force a swap if necessary.
   - We'll implement a new method `force_swap` to handle this logic.

3. Use floats for intermediate damage calculations:
   - We'll modify the `execute_skill` method to use floats for all calculations until the final damage is determined.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Equal speed resolution is now handled randomly using `random.choice()` in the `resolution_phase` method.
2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the new `force_swap` method, which is called after each skill execution in the `resolution_phase` method.
3. Intermediate damage calculations now explicitly use floats in the `execute_skill` method, with the final damage being converted to an integer at the end.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and do not alter any models, keeping them as pure data schemas. The changes are confined to the game logic within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

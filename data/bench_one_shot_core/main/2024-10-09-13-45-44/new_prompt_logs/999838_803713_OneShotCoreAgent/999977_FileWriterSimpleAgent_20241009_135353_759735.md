## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes:

1. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene.
2. Handle the effectiveness of the 'leaf' type in the type effectiveness calculations.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP to their max HP at the end of the battle.
2. We'll update the `get_type_factor` method to include the 'leaf' type in the effectiveness calculations.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class. We don't need to modify the `models.py` file because the creatures already have `hp` and `max_hp` attributes, and we're not adding any new properties or methods to the models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 10243891-0e00-4080-8621-9b3e439c39db
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        if self.battle_ended:
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            self.battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. Added a `reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures to their max HP.
2. Called `self.reset_creatures()` before transitioning to the MainMenuScene in the `run` method.
3. The `get_type_factor` method already includes the 'leaf' type in its effectiveness calculations, so no changes were needed there.

These modifications ensure that the state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of MainGameScene, and the effectiveness of the 'leaf' type is properly handled in the type effectiveness calculations. The implementation now adheres to the engine's architecture and guidelines while addressing the issues raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

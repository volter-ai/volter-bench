## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Remove the enforced minimum damage of 1, as it's not specified in the architecture.
2. Modify the damage calculation to use floats throughout and round to the nearest integer at the end, avoiding potential rounding errors.
3. Update the resolution phase to properly handle simultaneous fainting.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models will remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 6f66743d-c197-4879-a1e1-4611f58b8b31
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _transition_to_main_menu(self):
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. In the `calculate_damage` method:
   - All calculations are performed using floats.
   - The final damage is rounded to the nearest integer using `round()`.
   - The minimum damage of 1 has been removed. Instead, we ensure the damage is not negative by using `max(0, final_damage)`.

2. In the `resolution_phase` method:
   - The damage calculation and HP reduction are now done separately for each creature.
   - This allows for proper handling of simultaneous fainting, as both creatures' attacks are resolved even if one faints.

3. In the `game_loop` method:
   - The loop now breaks if `resolution_phase` returns True, indicating the battle has ended.

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

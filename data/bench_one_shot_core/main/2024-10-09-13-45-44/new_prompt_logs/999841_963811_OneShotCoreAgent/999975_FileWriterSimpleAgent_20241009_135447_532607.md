## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue. To fix this problem, we need to modify the damage calculation in the `MainGameScene` to explicitly use floats before converting to integers, as specified in the architecture. This change will be made in the `calculate_damage` method of the `MainGameScene` class.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `calculate_damage` method to use floats in all calculations.
2. We'll only convert the final damage to an integer at the very end of the calculation.

This change stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't affect the models, which remain as pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f819dca3-9b81-4c3c-932f-46e236ce498e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)

            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = (float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense)) * float(skill.base_damage)

        type_factor = float(self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type))
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5},
            "normal": {}  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "Both creatures fainted! It's a draw!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_player_creature(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp

    def _transition_to_main_menu(self):
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. In the `calculate_damage` method:
   - All values are explicitly converted to floats using `float()`.
   - The calculations are performed using these float values.
   - The final damage is converted to an integer only at the end of the calculation.

2. In the `get_type_factor` method:
   - The effectiveness values are now explicitly written as floats (2.0 and 0.5).
   - The default return value is also a float (1.0).

These changes ensure that all damage calculations are performed using floats before the final conversion to an integer, as specified in the architecture. This should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their role as pure data schemas.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of equal speed not being handled correctly, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the resolution_phase method, we'll add a check for equal speed.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's random.choice to randomly determine the order of skill execution.
3. We'll refactor the skill execution logic into a separate method to avoid code duplication.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. We don't need to modify any models, as the issue is with the battle logic in the scene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 97bb7608-cc9d-49c9-9af8-13b0b66df700
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skills_in_order(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skills_in_order(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly determine order
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skills_in_order(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
            else:
                self.execute_skills_in_order(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

    def execute_skills_in_order(self, first_player, first_creature, first_skill, second_player, second_creature, second_skill):
        self.execute_skill(first_player, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
        if second_creature.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second_player, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issue by properly handling the case of equal speed. The main changes are:

1. Modified the `resolution_phase` method to include a check for equal speed.
2. Added a new method `execute_skills_in_order` to handle the execution of skills in a specific order.
3. Used `random.choice` to randomly determine the order of skill execution when speeds are equal.

These changes ensure that when the player's creature and the opponent's creature have equal speed, the order of skill execution is randomly determined, providing a fair and balanced gameplay experience.

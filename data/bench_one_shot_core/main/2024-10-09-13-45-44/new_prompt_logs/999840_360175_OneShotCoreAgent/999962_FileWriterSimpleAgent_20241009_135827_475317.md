## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address these problems by modifying the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Implement a method to reset the player's creatures' state when leaving the MainGameScene.
2. Implement the behavior of the swapped creature being hit by the opponent's queued skill.
3. Adjust the damage calculation to apply the type factor before converting to an integer.
4. Add a method to reset creature states when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. A `reset_creatures_state` method has been added to reset the state of all creatures when leaving the MainGameScene. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. The behavior of the swapped creature being hit by the opponent's queued skill is now implemented in the `resolution_phase` method. When a player swaps, we check if the opponent has a queued skill and execute it against the newly swapped-in creature.

3. The damage calculation in the `execute_skill` method now applies the type factor before converting to an integer, ensuring more accurate damage calculations.

4. The `reset_creatures_state` method is called in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that creature states are reset when leaving the battle scene.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and we've only modified the game logic within the scene file.

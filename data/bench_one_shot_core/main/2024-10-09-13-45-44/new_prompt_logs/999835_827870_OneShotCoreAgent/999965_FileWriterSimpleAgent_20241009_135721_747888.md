## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I understand that we need to explicitly reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll address this issue:

1. To fix the issue:
   - We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the state of both the player's and bot's creatures.
   - This method will be called when transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
   - We'll reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp and clear any chosen skills.
   - This change will be implemented entirely within the MainGameScene, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

2. Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: a305ce7a-865b-42e7-b367-231f875816ad

        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):

```

This updated implementation addresses the issue raised in the QA feedback:

1. A new method `reset_creatures_state()` has been added to explicitly reset the state of all creatures.
2. This method is called in the `check_battle_end()` method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. The reset process restores all creatures' HP to their max_hp and clears any chosen skills.
4. All changes are contained within the MainGameScene, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

These modifications should resolve the issue while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the engine's capabilities.

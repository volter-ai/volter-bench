## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address the issues raised during QA/testing and propose a solution that adheres to the guidelines and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Prioritize swap actions before skill execution in the resolution phase:
      - We'll modify the resolution_phase method to handle swaps first, then execute skills.

   b. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
      - We'll add a method to handle forced swapping after each skill execution.

   c. Use floats for intermediate damage calculations:
      - We'll explicitly use floats in the damage calculation process.

   d. Ensure all changes are made within the MainGameScene, keeping models as pure data schemas.

2. Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 89b0a632-dcc6-4fa6-8045-198dc61ce880

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. Swap actions are now prioritized before skill execution in the resolution phase.
2. Forced swapping is implemented when a creature's HP reaches zero through the `check_and_force_swap` method.
3. Intermediate calculations in the damage formula now explicitly use floats.
4. All changes are contained within the MainGameScene, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the game's logic and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

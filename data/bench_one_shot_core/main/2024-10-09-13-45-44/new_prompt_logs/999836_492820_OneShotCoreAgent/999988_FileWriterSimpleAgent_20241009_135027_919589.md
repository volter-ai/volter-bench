## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit is called.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 28a98b8c-20bc-40c1-aecb-030de3028594
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
> {self.player_creature.skills[1].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            if self.player_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            if self.opponent_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn! Choose a skill for {self.player_creature.display_name}:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, choice.thing)

    def opponent_turn(self):
        opponent_skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
        return self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")
        return defender.hp == 0

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.
3. Keeping the main game loop intact, which continues until the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene behaves correctly within the game's architecture and the engine's capabilities.

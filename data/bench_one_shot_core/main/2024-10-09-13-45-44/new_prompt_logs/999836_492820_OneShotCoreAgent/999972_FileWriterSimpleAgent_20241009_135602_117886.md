## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the MainGameScene to reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the scene. This will ensure that the game follows the architecture requirements without adding methods or properties to the models.

Here's how I plan to fix the issue:

1. Add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp.
2. Call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach keeps the models as pure data schemas and maintains the game logic within the scene, staying within the capabilities of the engine.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 46a8b210-ead0-4c32-aa93-ad6a65bca8a0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
> {self.player_creature.skills[1].display_name}

Opponent's skills:
> {self.opponent_creature.skills[0].display_name}
> {self.opponent_creature.skills[1].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn! Choose a skill for {self.player_creature.display_name}:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's turn! {self.opponent_creature.display_name}'s available skills:")
        for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"- {skill.display_name}")
        
        opponent_skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {opponent_skill.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):

            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation addresses the issue by adding a `reset_creatures` method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum values. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

The changes maintain the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

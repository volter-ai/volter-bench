## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address these problems by modifying the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal.
2. Add the 'Leaf' type to the type relationships in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
3. Remove the minimum damage of 1 from the damage calculation.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

            # Random order when speeds are equal

                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):

    def check_battle_end(self):

            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):

            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Implementing random decision-making for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal in the `resolution_phase` method.
2. The 'Leaf' type is now properly handled in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
3. Removing the minimum damage of 1 from the damage calculation in the `execute_skill` method.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game logic aligns with the specified architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. Here's how I'll address these discrepancies:

1. I'll add an explicit welcome message in the MainMenuScene that is shown to the player using the `_show_text` method.
2. I'll modify the damage calculation to correctly convert to int after applying the type factor.
3. I'll remove the resetting of the player's creatures before transitioning out of MainGameScene, as it's not aligned with the architecture's description.
4. I'll remove the creature resetting entirely, as it's not mentioned in the architecture for either the player or the opponent.

These changes will be implemented in both the `main_menu_scene.py` and `main_game_scene.py` files. The models will remain unchanged as they are already pure data schemas without methods or properties.

Here are the rewritten files with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing phase:

1. An explicit welcome message is now shown to the player in the MainMenuScene using the `_show_text` method.
2. The final damage calculation now correctly converts to int after applying the type factor in the `_calculate_damage` method.
3. The resetting of the player's creatures before transitioning out of MainGameScene has been removed.
4. All creature resetting has been removed, as it's not mentioned in the architecture for either the player or the opponent.

These modifications align the implementation more closely with the described architecture while maintaining the existing structure and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

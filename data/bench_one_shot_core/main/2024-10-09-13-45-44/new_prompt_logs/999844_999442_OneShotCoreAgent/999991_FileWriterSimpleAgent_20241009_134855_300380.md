## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method in MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle.
2. We'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the scene exits properly in all cases.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 1852dd0e-be94-4b0b-90b6-0db89afca194
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # After battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player, player_skill), (self.opponent, foe_skill)
        else:
            first, second = (self.opponent, foe_skill), (self.player, player_skill)

        for attacker, skill in [first, second]:
            if attacker == self.player:
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill)
            else:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                return

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `battle_loop` method always exits properly by breaking the loop when the battle ends.
2. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, which properly exits the scene.
3. Keeping the battle logic intact while improving the flow of the game.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits correctly in all cases. The scene will now transition back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the player to choose to play again or quit the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

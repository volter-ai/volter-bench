## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly, which is causing the test to fail.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `battle_loop` method to properly handle the end of the battle and trigger the scene transition.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 51185fd3-3caf-498f-9c2a-d359aa702588
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.foe_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp = max(0, self.foe_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)

        if self.foe_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - foe_skill.damage)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle loop ends in the `run` method.
2. Ensuring that the `battle_loop` method properly exits when the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the `MainGameScene` exits properly after each battle, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The scene now follows the correct pattern of always ending with a transition or a game quit, which should satisfy the engine's requirements and fix the `FixableException` we were seeing in the test output.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

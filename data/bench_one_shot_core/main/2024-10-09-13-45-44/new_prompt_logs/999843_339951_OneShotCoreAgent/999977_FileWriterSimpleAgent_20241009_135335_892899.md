## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The whole game flow test is failing because the MainGameScene is not transitioning or quitting properly.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene after the battle ends. We'll do this by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle is over.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll add a call to `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the battle_loop method breaks out of the loop when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a message to inform the player that they're returning to the main menu.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e8acec3a-dd5c-4ffb-a411-33abd678a57a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.foe.display_name}: {self.foe_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.foe_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.foe_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will satisfy the requirement for the scene to exit in an expected manner, fixing both the MainGameScene test and the whole game flow test.

The modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. We're using the `_transition_to_scene` method to properly exit the scene, which is the expected behavior in the engine's design.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then provide the updated file to fix these discrepancies.

1. Handling of creature resets: We'll remove the reset logic from the `MainGameScene` and instead create new creatures from their prototype IDs when starting a new battle.

2. Damage calculation: We'll simplify the damage calculation to match the architecture more closely, removing the float conversions and the minimum damage of 1.

3. Random decision-making for speed ties: We'll use the engine's random number generator instead of Python's built-in random module.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to create new creatures from prototype IDs at the start of each battle, instead of resetting existing creatures.
2. We'll update the damage calculation in `MainGameScene` to use integer math and remove the minimum damage of 1.
3. We'll use the engine's random number generator for speed tie decisions.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.opponent_creature = None

            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Removing the creature reset logic and instead creating new creatures from prototype IDs at the start of each battle in the `_initialize_battle` method.
2. Simplifying the damage calculation to use integer math and removing the minimum damage of 1.
3. Using the engine's random number generator (`self._app.random.randint`) for speed tie decisions.
4. Removing float conversions and using integer division in the damage calculation.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture and improve the implementation according to the QA feedback.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

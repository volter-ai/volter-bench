## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly, which is causing the test to fail.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll address the problems:

1. We'll add a transition to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll update the `battle_loop` to break and transition when the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9491f28c-7132-4fa7-b864-a64ec4272d99
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        self.execute_skill(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player else opponent_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, opponent_skill if first == self.player else player_skill)

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, defender: Player, skill: Skill):
        attacker_creature = attacker.creatures[0]
        defender_creature = defender.creatures[0]
        damage = max(0, attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The scene now properly exits by transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. The `check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean, which is used to break the battle loop when the battle is over.
3. The `resolution_phase` now checks if the battle has ended after the first skill execution, preventing unnecessary skill execution if the battle has already ended.

These modifications should resolve the "scene was not exited in an expected manner" error and ensure that the game flow works correctly. The scene will now properly transition or quit when the battle ends, adhering to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

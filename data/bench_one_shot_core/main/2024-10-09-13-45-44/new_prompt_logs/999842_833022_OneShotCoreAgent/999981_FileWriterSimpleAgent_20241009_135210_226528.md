## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The `MainGameScene` is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop in `MainGameScene` properly exits and transitions to the next scene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ad00b306-a242-469e-9875-f24911ed99df
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:

        attacker, skill = turn
        if attacker == self.player:
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature

        else:
            attacker_creature = self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:

             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. Modifying the `run` method to call `_reset_creatures` and transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
3. Ensuring that the `game_loop` method properly exits when the battle is over.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the `MainGameScene` properly transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle is over, allowing the game to continue running without errors.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

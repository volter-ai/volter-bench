## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both the missing random decision for equal speeds and the incorrect implementation of type relationships for the Leaf type. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. For the random decision on equal speeds:
   - In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll add a check for equal speeds.
   - If speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.

2. For the correct implementation of type relationships:
   - We'll update the `calculate_weakness_factor` method to correctly handle all type relationships, including Leaf.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: e0f2af20-326c-489b-b026-82e792a78f81
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:

    def run(self):

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # Equal speeds, randomly choose who goes first
            first, second = random.choice([(self.player, self.opponent), (self.opponent, self.player)])
            first_creature = self.player_creature if first == self.player else self.opponent_creature
            second_creature = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player else self.player_creature
            first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player else foe_skill
            second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player else player_skill

            self.execute_skill(first, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)

                self.execute_skill(second, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        type_relationships = {
            "normal": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"normal": 1, "fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"normal": 1, "fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return type_relationships[skill_type][defender_type]

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.end_battle(f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.end_battle(f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self, message):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The `resolution_phase` method now includes a case for equal speeds, where it randomly chooses which creature goes first.
2. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now uses a dictionary to correctly implement all type relationships, including Leaf.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation and then write the necessary files for the creature battler game.

Plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations
   - Define Skill, Creature, and Player models inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
   - Ensure models are in the correct dependency order
   - Use direct references to other model types, not string IDs

2. Create JSON files in `main_game/content/`:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Update `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement the MainMenuScene as described in the documentation
   - Add options to play or quit the game

4. Create `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement the MainGameScene with the described battle logic
   - Include player choice, foe choice, and resolution phases
   - Handle creature swapping and battle end conditions

5. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene
   - Ensure proper scene transitions

6. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`
   - Implement random run tests for both scenes

Now, I'll write out the files according to this plan.

```

This completes the implementation of the creature battler game based on the provided architecture and guidelines. The game includes the necessary models, scenes, and tests as specified. The main game logic is implemented in the MainGameScene, which handles the battle mechanics, including player and bot turns, skill execution, and creature swapping.

The test files for both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene use the random mode of the HumanListener to perform multiple random runs, ensuring that the scenes can handle various user inputs without crashing.

To run the game, execute the `main_game/main.py` file. To run the tests, use pytest on the test files in the `main_game/tests/` directory.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the validation error for the `active_creature` field in the `Player` class. The error occurs because the `active_creature` field is not initialized when creating a player from the prototype. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `models.py` file, we'll modify the `Player` class to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]`. This allows the field to be `None` initially.

2. We'll add a default value of `None` to the `active_creature` field using the `Field` constructor.

3. In the `main_game_scene.py` file, we'll initialize the `active_creature` in the `initialize_battle` method instead of relying on it being set during player creation.

Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = Field(default=None)
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional and provides a default value of `None`. This should resolve the validation error we were encountering.

Now, we need to update the `main_game_scene.py` file to initialize the `active_creature` in the `initialize_battle` method. Here's the updated `initialize_battle` method:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
def initialize_battle(self):
    self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0] if self.player.creatures else None
    self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0] if self.bot.creatures else None
```

This change ensures that the `active_creature` is set when the battle is initialized, rather than relying on it being set during player creation.

These modifications should resolve the validation error while maintaining the pure data schema nature of the models and adhering to the engine's architecture. The `Player` model remains a simple data structure without methods or properties, and we're using the scene logic to handle the initialization of the `active_creature`.

This rewritten file ensures that the MainGameScene class is properly defined and exported. The class name is consistent throughout the file, and there are no obvious syntax errors or indentation issues that might prevent the class from being defined correctly.

By fixing this file, we should resolve the import error in the main.py file and the subsequent errors in the test files. The MainGameScene class should now be properly importable in other parts of the project.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError that occurs when trying to swap creatures. The error suggests that `new_creature` is None when we're trying to access its `display_name`. This likely happens when all creatures of a player have fainted, and there are no available creatures to swap to.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `force_swap` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll check if there are any available creatures before attempting to swap.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll set the `active_creature` to None and display a message that the player has no more creatures.
3. We'll update the `swap_creature` method to handle the case where `new_creature` is None.
4. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to end the battle when either player has no active creature.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and handle the case where a player runs out of creatures more gracefully. The battle will now end when either player has no active creature, and the game will display appropriate messages for creature swaps and battle outcomes.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the MainGameScene where the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is likely happening because the battle is ending without properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method in MainGameScene to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the `run` method, we'll use this return value to determine when to transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
3. We'll add a method to transition back to the main menu after the battle ends.

```

These changes ensure that the MainGameScene properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, addressing the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The `end_battle` method is called when `check_battle_end` returns True, which then transitions the game back to the main menu.

This solution maintains the structure of the models and adheres to the architecture and capabilities of the engine. It doesn't add any methods or properties to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The implementation has minor discrepancies, including the lack of random resolution for equal speed in the Resolution Phase and the absence of the 'Back' option in the bot's choice phase. Additionally, the damage calculation does not explicitly show the use of floats throughout the process.",
  "qa_result": "failed"
}



Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Content: To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement random resolution for equal speed in the Resolution Phase.
2. Add the 'Back' option in the bot's choice phase (although it won't be used by the bot, it will be consistent with the player's options).
3. Explicitly use floats throughout the damage calculation process.

These changes can be implemented without modifying the models or exceeding the capabilities of the engine. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

These changes address the issues raised in the QA pass:

1. Random resolution for equal speed is now implemented in the `resolution_phase` method.
2. The 'Back' option is added to the bot's choice phase in the `bot_turn` method, although it's not used by the bot.
3. Floats are explicitly used throughout the damage calculation process in the `execute_skill` method.

The changes maintain the structure of the models and adhere to the architecture and capabilities of the engine. No methods or properties were added to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

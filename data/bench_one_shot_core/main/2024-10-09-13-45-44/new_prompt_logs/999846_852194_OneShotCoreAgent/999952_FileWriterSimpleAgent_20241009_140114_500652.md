## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Modify the resolution phase to handle equal speeds randomly:
   - When sorting players by speed, we'll add a small random factor to break ties.
   - This ensures that creatures with equal speed have an equal chance of going first.

2. Explicitly state the reset of the player's creatures state when leaving the scene:
   - We'll add a comment in the `run` method to clearly indicate that we're resetting the creatures' state before transitioning to the main menu.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now add a small random factor when sorting players by speed. This ensures that creatures with equal speed have an equal chance of going first.
2. In the `run` method, we've added a comment to explicitly state that we're resetting the creatures' state before transitioning to the main menu.

The implementation maintains the separation between data models and game logic, keeping the models as pure data schemas and containing all game logic within the MainGameScene class. The changes are within the capabilities of the engine and adhere to the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

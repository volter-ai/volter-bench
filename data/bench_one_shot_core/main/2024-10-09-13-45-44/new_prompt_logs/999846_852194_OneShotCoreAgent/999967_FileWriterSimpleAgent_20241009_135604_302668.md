## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError where the 'Creature' object has no attribute 'chosen_skill'. This error occurs because we're trying to access a 'chosen_skill' attribute on the Creature model, which doesn't exist. Instead of adding this attribute to the Creature model (which should remain a pure data schema), we'll modify the MainGameScene to manage the chosen skills separately.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll create a dictionary in the MainGameScene to store the chosen skills for each creature.
2. We'll update the methods that set and use the chosen skills to work with this dictionary instead of trying to access a non-existent attribute on the Creature object.
3. We'll ensure that the chosen skills are properly initialized and cleared for each turn.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene addresses the AttributeError by introducing a `chosen_skills` dictionary to store the chosen skills for each creature. The main changes are:

1. We've added a `chosen_skills` dictionary to store the chosen skills for each creature.
2. The `player_turn` method now updates this dictionary instead of setting a `chosen_skill` attribute on the Creature object.
3. The `resolution_phase` method now uses the `chosen_skills` dictionary to retrieve the chosen skill for each creature.
4. We've added a `clear_chosen_skills` method to reset the chosen skills at the beginning of each turn.
5. The `execute_skill` method now takes the skill as a parameter instead of accessing it from the creature.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError we were encountering while maintaining the separation between the data models and the game logic. The Creature model remains a pure data schema, and all the game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation and then write the necessary files for the creature battler game.

Plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations
   - Define Skill, Creature, and Player models inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
   - Ensure models are in the correct dependency order
   - Use direct references to other model types, not string IDs

2. Create JSON files in `main_game/content/`:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Update `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement the MainMenuScene as described in the documentation
   - Add options to play or quit the game

4. Create `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement the MainGameScene with the described battle logic
   - Include player choice, foe choice, and resolution phases
   - Handle creature swapping and battle end conditions

5. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene
   - Ensure proper scene transitions

6. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`
   - Implement random run tests for both scenes

Now, I'll write out each file according to this plan.

This completes the implementation of the creature battler game based on the provided architecture and guidelines. The game includes the following components:

1. Models (`main_game/models.py`): Defines the Skill, Creature, and Player classes.
2. Content JSON files (`main_game/content/`): Contains the prototypes for skills, creatures, and players.
3. Main Menu Scene (`main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`): Implements the main menu with options to play or quit.
4. Main Game Scene (`main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`): Implements the battle logic, including player turns, skill execution, and battle resolution.
5. Main App (`main_game/main.py`): Sets up the game, registers scenes, and provides methods to create players and bots.
6. Test files: Implements random run tests for both the Main Menu Scene and the Main Game Scene.

The implementation follows the provided guidelines, including:
- Using AbstractThing and AbstractPlayer as base classes for models
- Keeping models as pure data schemas without methods
- Referencing other models directly in the correct dependency order
- Implementing game logic within scenes
- Using transition methods to change scenes
- Creating models using `from_prototype_id`
- Treating bots the same as players
- Implementing random run tests for scenes

This implementation should provide a functional creature battler game with the described features and battle mechanics.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the ValidationError for the `active_creature` field in the Player model. The error occurs because the `active_creature` field is not initialized when creating a Player instance. We can resolve this by making the `active_creature` field optional in the Player model.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `main_game/models.py` file, we'll modify the Player class to make the `active_creature` field optional by using `Optional[Creature]` and setting a default value of `None`.

2. We'll also need to update the `initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both the player and the bot.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/models.py` file with the proposed solution:

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"

    category: str = "Creature"

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now that we've made this change, the `active_creature` field is optional and defaults to `None`. This should resolve the ValidationError we were encountering.

We also need to update the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` when initializing the battle. Here's the updated `initialize_battle` method in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
# ... (keep the existing imports and class definition)

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.initialize_battle()

    def initialize_battle(self):
        if self.player.creatures:
            self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        if self.bot.creatures:
            self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    # ... (keep the rest of the class implementation)
```

These changes should resolve the ValidationError we were encountering and allow the tests to run without failing due to the `active_creature` field initialization.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the MainGameScene where the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is likely happening because the battle is ending without properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. We'll modify the MainGameScene to ensure that it always ends with a proper transition or game quit.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. We'll update the `run` method to continue the battle loop until it ends, and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that all paths in the scene lead to either a transition or a game quit.

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by ensuring that the scene always ends with a transition back to the MainMenuScene. The main changes are:

1. The `run` method now has a `while True` loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. The `check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. After the battle loop ends, we explicitly transition back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These changes should resolve the FixableException we were encountering and allow the tests to run without failing due to the scene terminating without a proper transition or game quit.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError where the 'Creature' object has no attribute 'chosen_skill'. This error occurs because we're trying to access a 'chosen_skill' attribute on the Creature model, which doesn't exist. Instead of adding this attribute to the Creature model (which should remain a pure data schema), we'll modify the MainGameScene to manage the chosen skills separately.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll create a dictionary in the MainGameScene to store the chosen skills for each creature.
2. We'll update the methods that set and use the chosen skills to work with this dictionary instead of trying to access a non-existent attribute on the Creature object.
3. We'll ensure that the chosen skills are properly initialized and cleared for each turn.

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene addresses the AttributeError by introducing a `chosen_skills` dictionary to store the chosen skills for each creature. The main changes are:

1. We've added a `chosen_skills` dictionary to store the chosen skills for each creature.
2. The `player_turn` method now updates this dictionary instead of setting a `chosen_skill` attribute on the Creature object.
3. The `resolution_phase` method now uses the `chosen_skills` dictionary to retrieve the chosen skill for each creature.
4. We've added a `clear_chosen_skills` method to reset the chosen skills at the beginning of each turn.
5. The `execute_skill` method now takes the skill as a parameter instead of accessing it from the creature.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError we were encountering while maintaining the separation between the data models and the game logic. The Creature model remains a pure data schema, and all the game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the FixableException that's being raised when we try to use a Creature object as a dictionary key. This is happening because AbstractThing (which Creature inherits from) is not hashable. Instead of using the Creature object directly as a key, we should use its prototype_id. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll change the `chosen_skills` dictionary to use the creature's prototype_id as the key instead of the Creature object itself.
2. We'll modify the methods that interact with the `chosen_skills` dictionary to use the prototype_id when setting or getting values.
3. We'll ensure that we're always using the prototype_id when we need to identify a specific creature.

        return False
```

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene addresses the FixableException by using the creature's prototype_id as the key in the `chosen_skills` dictionary instead of the Creature object itself. The main changes are:

1. The `chosen_skills` dictionary now uses `str` (prototype_id) as the key type instead of Creature.
2. In the `player_turn` method, we now use `current_player.active_creature.prototype_id` as the key when setting chosen skills.
3. In the `choose_creature` method, we compare prototype_ids instead of Creature objects directly.
4. In the `resolution_phase` method, we use `player.active_creature.prototype_id` to get the chosen skill.

These changes should resolve the FixableException we were encountering while maintaining the separation between the data models and the game logic. The Creature model remains a pure data schema, and all the game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Fix the skill execution for special skills by adjusting the damage calculation formula.
2. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.
3. Add a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.

Here's how I'll implement these fixes:

1. In the `execute_skill` method, I'll modify the damage calculation for special skills to match the description in the game design.
2. I'll create a new method `check_and_swap_fainted_creature` that will be called after each skill execution to check if a creature's HP has reached zero and force a swap if necessary.
3. I'll add a `reset_creatures_state` method that will be called when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these proposed solutions:

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The skill execution for special skills now uses the correct formula: `(attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage`.
2. The `check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method is now called after each skill execution, forcing a swap when a creature's HP reaches zero.
3. The `reset_creatures_state` method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, resetting the HP of all creatures to their maximum values.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies in skill execution, implement forced swapping for fainted creatures, and ensure that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene. The changes maintain the separation between data models and game logic, keeping the models as pure data schemas and containing all game logic within the MainGameScene class.

Content: Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I understand the issues raised during QA/testing, and I'll address them in the MainGameScene implementation. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Prioritize swap actions over skills in the resolution phase:
   - We'll modify the resolution_phase method to first execute all swap actions, then execute skills.

2. Handle swapped-in creatures getting hit by the opponent's queued skill:
   - After executing swaps, we'll check if the opponent has a queued skill and execute it against the newly swapped-in creature.

3. Ensure float calculations are used throughout the damage calculation process:
   - We'll modify the execute_skill method to use float calculations for all damage calculations, only converting to an integer at the final step.

The implementation maintains the separation between data models and game logic, keeping the models as pure data schemas and containing all game logic within the MainGameScene class. The changes are within the capabilities of the engine and adhere to the architecture guidelines.

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Content: I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Modify the resolution phase to handle equal speeds randomly:
   - When sorting players by speed, we'll add a small random factor to break ties.
   - This ensures that creatures with equal speed have an equal chance of going first.

2. Explicitly state the reset of the player's creatures state when leaving the scene:
   - We'll add a comment in the `run` method to clearly indicate that we're resetting the creatures' state before transitioning to the main menu.

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we now add a small random factor when sorting players by speed. This ensures that creatures with equal speed have an equal chance of going first.
2. In the `run` method, we've added a comment to explicitly state that we're resetting the creatures' state before transitioning to the main menu.

The implementation maintains the separation between data models and game logic, keeping the models as pure data schemas and containing all game logic within the MainGameScene class. The changes are within the capabilities of the engine and adhere to the architecture guidelines.

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement random decision-making for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal.
2. Use floats throughout the damage calculation and convert to integers only at the final step.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll add a check for equal speeds and use `random.choice` to determine the order of skill execution.
2. We'll modify the `execute_skill` method to use floats for all calculations and only convert to an integer at the final step.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already correct and follow the guidelines.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 9444819d-86d1-492f-9ad5-325b6abad5f1

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        else:
            # Random decision when speeds are equal
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = float(attacker_creature.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender_creature.defense)

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):

    def check_battle_end(self):

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Random decision-making for skill execution order when creature speeds are equal is now implemented in the `resolution_phase` method.
2. Floats are used throughout the damage calculation in the `execute_skill` method, with the final damage being converted to an integer only at the last step.

These modifications should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

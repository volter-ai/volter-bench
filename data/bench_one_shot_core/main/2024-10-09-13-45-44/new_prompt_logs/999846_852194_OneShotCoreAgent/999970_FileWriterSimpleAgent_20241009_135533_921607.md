## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the MainGameScene where the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is likely happening because the battle is ending without properly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. We'll modify the MainGameScene to ensure that it always ends with a proper transition or game quit.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. We'll update the `run` method to continue the battle loop until it ends, and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that all paths in the scene lead to either a transition or a game quit.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

    def initialize_battle(self):

                return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene addresses the issue by ensuring that the scene always ends with a transition back to the MainMenuScene. The main changes are:

1. The `run` method now has a `while True` loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. The `check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. After the battle loop ends, we explicitly transition back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These changes should resolve the FixableException we were encountering and allow the tests to run without failing due to the scene terminating without a proper transition or game quit.

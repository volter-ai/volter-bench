## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Fix the skill execution for special skills by adjusting the damage calculation formula.
2. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.
3. Add a method to reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.

Here's how I'll implement these fixes:

1. In the `execute_skill` method, I'll modify the damage calculation for special skills to match the description in the game design.
2. I'll create a new method `check_and_swap_fainted_creature` that will be called after each skill execution to check if a creature's HP has reached zero and force a swap if necessary.
3. I'll add a `reset_creatures_state` method that will be called when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these proposed solutions:

```

These changes address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The skill execution for special skills now uses the correct formula: `(attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage`.
2. The `check_and_swap_fainted_creature` method is now called after each skill execution, forcing a swap when a creature's HP reaches zero.
3. The `reset_creatures_state` method is called before transitioning out of the MainGameScene, resetting the HP of all creatures to their maximum values.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies in skill execution, implement forced swapping for fainted creatures, and ensure that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene. The changes maintain the separation between data models and game logic, keeping the models as pure data schemas and containing all game logic within the MainGameScene class.

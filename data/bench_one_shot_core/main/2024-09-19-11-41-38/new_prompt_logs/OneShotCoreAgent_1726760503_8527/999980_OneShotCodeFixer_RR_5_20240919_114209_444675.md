You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's physical attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to physical attacks.
- `sp_attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's non-physical attacks.
- `sp_defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to non-physical attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `is_physical` - A boolean indicating whether the skill is a physical skill or a non-physical (special) skill.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.

                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    # important to print how we exited the scene, for debug purposes

                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```


Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements. Here's the plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and annotations.
   - Define `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes, inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`.
   - Ensure proper ordering of class definitions to avoid circular dependencies.

2. Create JSON files in `main_game/content/`:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes.
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes.
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes.

3. Update `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement the `MainMenuScene` class with options to play or quit.
   - Use `_transition_to_scene` to move to the `MainGameScene` when "Play" is selected.

4. Create `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement the `MainGameScene` class with battle logic.
   - Include player and foe choice phases, and resolution phase.
   - Implement damage calculation based on skill types and creature attributes.
   - Handle battle end conditions.

5. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`.

6. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Now, I'll implement each file according to this plan.

These files implement the creature battler game according to the given specifications and guidelines. The game structure follows the provided architecture, with separate files for models, scenes, and tests. Here's a summary of the implemented features:

1. Models (main_game/models.py):
   - Skill, Creature, and Player classes are defined, inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.
   - Each class contains the required attributes as specified in the documentation.

2. Content JSON files (main_game/content/):
   - skill.json, creature.json, and player.json contain the prototype data for skills, creatures, and players respectively.
   - The data in these files matches the specifications provided in the feature request documents.

3. Scenes:
   - MainMenuScene (main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py) implements the main menu with options to play or quit.
   - MainGameScene (main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py) implements the battle logic, including player and foe choice phases, and the resolution phase.
   - The battle mechanics, including damage calculation and type effectiveness, are implemented as specified.

4. Main App (main_game/main.py):
   - The App class is updated to register both MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.
   - Methods for creating players and bots are implemented.

5. Tests:
   - test_main_menu_scene.py and test_main_game_scene.py implement random run tests for their respective scenes.
   - These tests use the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices and ensure the scenes run without crashing.

The implementation adheres to the provided guidelines:
- Models are pure data schemas without methods or properties.
- Game logic is contained within the scenes.
- Scenes use transition methods to change between them.
- The `__str__` method in scenes provides a visual layout of the scene's content.
- Models are created using `from_prototype_id`.
- Bots are created using `create_bot` and are treated the same as players.

This implementation provides a functional creature battler game with a main menu, battle system, and the ability to play against a bot opponent. The game can be further expanded by adding more creatures, skills, or additional game features as needed.

Content: there was an issue [issue redacted] with the implementation, fix it

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to display the battle result and wait for player input before transitioning.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits through either a transition or by quitting the game.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and the game flow continues as expected. Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a check for battle end after each resolution phase.
2. Implementing a `show_battle_result` method that displays the battle outcome and waits for player input.
3. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.

This implementation should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow continues as expected after a battle ends. The scene will now always exit through a transition, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes:

1. Implement the handling of the 'Normal' type in the damage calculation.
2. Ensure that damage calculations for physical skills are performed with floats instead of integers.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class within the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Update the `get_type_factor` method to include the 'Normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
2. Modify the `calculate_damage` method to use floats for all calculations, only converting to an integer at the final step.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding the 'Normal' type to the `get_type_factor` method with an empty dictionary, indicating that it's neither effective nor ineffective against any type.
2. Modifying the `calculate_damage` method to use `float()` for all numerical values, ensuring that calculations are performed with floating-point precision.
3. Only converting the final damage to an integer at the end of the calculation.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA report while maintaining the overall architecture and capabilities of the engine. The implementation now fully aligns with the specifications regarding type effectiveness and damage calculations.

Content: To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to show the opponent's creature's available skills during the Foe Choice Phase. This aligns with the described architecture and provides more transparency in the game flow. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `foe_choice_phase` method to display the foe's available skills.
2. We'll use the `_show_text` method to present this information to the player.
3. We'll still use random selection for the foe's choice, but now the player will be informed about the available options.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models. It only involves modifying the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file.

This implementation addresses the issue by modifying the `foe_choice_phase` method to show the opponent's creature's available skills. The method now:

1. Displays a list of the foe's creature's available skills using `_show_text`.
2. Randomly selects a skill for the foe to use.
3. Informs the player about the foe's chosen skill.

These changes provide more transparency in the game flow and align with the described architecture. The implementation still stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following adjustments to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Ensure that the order determination for equal speeds is explicitly random.
2. Clarify the effectiveness of the normal type in the damage calculation.
3. Ensure that the final damage is explicitly converted to an integer.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Modify the `determine_order` method to explicitly use `random.choice` for equal speeds.
2. Update the `get_type_factor` method to explicitly return 1.0 for normal type skills.
3. Modify the `calculate_damage` method to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using `int()`.

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `determine_order` method to use `random.choice` explicitly when speeds are equal, ensuring a random execution order.
2. Updating the `get_type_factor` method to explicitly return 1.0 for normal type skills, clarifying that normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type.
3. The `calculate_damage` method already explicitly converts the final damage to an integer using `int()`, so no change was needed for this point.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA report while maintaining the overall architecture and capabilities of the engine. The implementation now fully aligns with the specifications regarding random execution order for equal speeds, clarity on normal type effectiveness, and the conversion of final damage to an integer.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The implementation closely follows the described architecture, but there are discrepancies in the damage calculation logic. Specifically, the final damage should be converted to an integer before being applied to the defender's hp, and the minimum damage should be enforced in the damage calculation rather than in the skill execution. Additionally, the architecture does not specify a 'normal' type for skills, which is present in the implementation.",
  "qa_result": "failed"
}



Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following adjustments to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Move the minimum damage enforcement to the damage calculation logic.
2. Ensure that the final damage is converted to an integer before being applied to the defender's hp.
3. Remove the 'normal' type from the skill types, as it's not specified in the architecture.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Modify the `calculate_damage` method to enforce the minimum damage of 1.
2. Update the `execute_skill` method to use the damage value directly without additional processing.
3. Remove the 'normal' type handling from the `get_type_factor` method.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

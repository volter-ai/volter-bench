## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll describe how to fix the issue and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

To address the lack of a queue system for skills in the Resolution Phase, we'll modify the MainGameScene class. We'll introduce a queue for skills and adjust the resolution phase to process skills from this queue. Here's how we'll implement this:

- Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the MainGameScene class to store the queued skills.
- Modify the player_choice_phase and bot_choice_phase methods to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
- Update the resolution_phase method to process skills from the queue instead of taking them as parameters.
- Implement a new method called `execute_skill` to handle the execution of individual skills from the queue.

These changes will align the implementation with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Updated MainGameScene file:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Skill, Creature, Creature]] = []

    def __str__(self):

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.damage} damage" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            if not self.player_choice_phase():
                return

            # Bot turn
            self.bot_choice_phase()

            # Resolution phase
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                return

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return False

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((skill_choice.thing, self.player_creature, self.bot_creature))
        return True

    def bot_choice_phase(self):
        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, skill_choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((skill_choice.thing, self.bot_creature, self.player_creature))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            skill, user, target = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            self.execute_skill(skill, user, target)

    def execute_skill(self, skill: Skill, user: Creature, target: Creature):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{user.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        target.hp -= skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{target.display_name} took {skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The enemy {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated implementation introduces a queue system for skills in the Resolution Phase, addressing the discrepancy from the described architecture. The `skill_queue` attribute stores tuples of (Skill, user Creature, target Creature). The resolution_phase method now processes skills from this queue, and the execute_skill method handles the execution of individual skills. This change ensures that the game follows the specified turn structure with distinct phases for player choice, foe choice, and resolution.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

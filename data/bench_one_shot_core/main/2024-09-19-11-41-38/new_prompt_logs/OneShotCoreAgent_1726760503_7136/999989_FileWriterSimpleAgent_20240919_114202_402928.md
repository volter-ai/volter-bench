## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The `MainGameScene` is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after a player loses all their creatures.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll modify the `run` method to break the loop and transition when the battle ends.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

    def initialize_battle(self):

        if self.bot.creatures:
            self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

        new_creature = self._wait_for_choice(player, creature_choices)
        self.swap_creature(player, new_creature.thing)
        return True
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `run` method to break the loop when `check_battle_end` returns `True`.
2. Adding a `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` call at the end of the `run` method to ensure the scene transitions properly when the battle ends.
3. Keeping the `check_battle_end` method as a boolean function that determines if the battle has ended.

These modifications should resolve the AssertionError we were seeing in the tests and ensure that the game transitions properly when a battle ends. The scene will now exit in an expected manner by transitioning back to the main menu after each battle, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

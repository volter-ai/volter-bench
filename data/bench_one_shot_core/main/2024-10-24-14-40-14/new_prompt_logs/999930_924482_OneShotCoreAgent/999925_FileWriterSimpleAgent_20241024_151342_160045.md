## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method of MainGameScene, instead of just returning True, we'll transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll add a new method `end_battle` to handle the end of the battle, which will either transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game based on the player's choice.
3. We'll update the `battle_loop` to break out of the loop when `check_battle_end` returns True.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: cfc43a3b-b2e3-4170-abec-f589ed31ca4e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):

            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        play_again = Button("Play Again")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, quit_game])
        
        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game entirely. The `end_battle` method gives the player a choice to play again or quit, which should resolve the problem of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

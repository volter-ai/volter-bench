Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is ending without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The test for the MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll update the game loop to continue until the player chooses to quit.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: a0def5ab-21db-4599-988c-6f760f0a6981
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn:
{self.get_skill_choices()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.game_loop()
            if not self.play_again():
                break

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} was defeated. You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            # Reset creatures' HP for a new battle
            self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
            self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
            return True
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
            return False
```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `play_again` method that prompts the player to play again or quit after each battle.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue playing battles until the player chooses to quit.
3. Ensuring that the game either transitions to a new scene or quits entirely, avoiding the antipattern of returning directly from the scene.

These changes should resolve both the test failure and the FixableException raised during the whole game test. The scene will now properly exit by calling `_quit_whole_game` when the player chooses to quit, and it will continue running new battles if the player chooses to play again.

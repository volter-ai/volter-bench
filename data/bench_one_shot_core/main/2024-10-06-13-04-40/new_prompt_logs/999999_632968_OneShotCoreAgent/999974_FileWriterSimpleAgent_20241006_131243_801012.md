Content: To address the issue of not resetting the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to make changes to the MainGameScene class. Since we can't add methods to the models, we'll handle this in the scene itself.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' HP to their max_hp value.
2. We'll call this method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f15d3abf-b83d-4a6b-99dc-2508f3ed4d11
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

            if choice == quit_button:
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._quit_whole_game()

            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices).thing

            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolve turn
            self._resolve_turn(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
            self._resolve_turn(self.bot, self.bot_creature, bot_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _resolve_turn(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = skill.damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender_creature.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

In this updated version of the MainGameScene, we've added a new method `_reset_creatures()` that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the bot to their maximum HP. This method is called in two places:

1. Before quitting the game when the player chooses to quit.
2. Before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends (either in victory or defeat).

This ensures that the creatures' state is reset when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, addressing the issue raised in the QA pass. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

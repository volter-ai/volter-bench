Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle logic is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle logic to properly handle the end of the battle and trigger the transition.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 03cb732d-5173-4a93-946e-b48427179754
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2), (self.player, creature1)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, creature1), (self.opponent, creature2)
            else:

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Creature) -> int:
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the battle until `battle_ended` is True.
3. After the battle ends, we reset the creatures, show a message, and transition back to the MainMenuScene.

This solution ensures that:
- The scene doesn't terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
- The battle logic properly handles the end of the battle.
- The game flow continues after a battle, returning to the main menu.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and the AssertionError in the tests, as the scene now properly exits by transitioning to another scene.

Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we have made the necessary changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file. Below is the JSON instance formatted according to the provided schema, which describes the action to overwrite the file with the updated content:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "overwrite",
      "excerpt_id": "03cb732d-5173-4a93-946e-b48427179754",
      "file_path": "main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON object specifies that the file `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` should be overwritten with the new content provided in the excerpt, using the specified `excerpt_id`. This action will implement the changes needed to fix the issues with the MainGameScene and battle logic.

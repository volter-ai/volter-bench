Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle, so they're ready for the next game.

3. We'll ensure that the _check_battle_end method returns True when the battle is over, allowing the run method to exit its loop and transition to the next scene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 0de39bf6-b9f7-4199-9584-a0e0614a8d48
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:

            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = self._calculate_raw_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        final_damage = int(self._apply_type_effectiveness(skill, defender) * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_raw_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            return attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            return (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def _apply_type_effectiveness(self, skill, defender):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2, ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2, ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2, ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. We've modified the `run` method to break out of the loop and transition to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We've added a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after each battle.
3. The `_check_battle_end` method now correctly returns True when the battle is over, allowing the scene to exit properly.

These modifications should fix both the MainGameScene random run test and the whole game flow test. The scene will now properly exit and transition back to the MainMenuScene when a battle ends, preventing the "scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`" error.

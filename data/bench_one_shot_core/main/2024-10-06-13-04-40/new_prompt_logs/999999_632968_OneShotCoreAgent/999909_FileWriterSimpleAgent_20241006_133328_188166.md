Content: I understand the issue now. You're right that the maximum turn limit and draw condition were not specified in the architecture documents. I'll remove these additions and stick strictly to the described architecture. Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. Remove the turn counter and maximum turn limit from the MainGameScene.
2. Remove the draw condition from the run method.
3. Ensure that the battle continues until one of the creatures' HP reaches zero, as specified in the architecture.
4. Keep the transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, as this is a logical flow for the game.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```

This revised implementation adheres strictly to the architecture described in the documents:

1. The battle continues until one of the creatures' HP reaches zero.
2. There's no maximum turn limit or draw condition.
3. The game logic remains within the scene, and the models are not modified.
4. After the battle ends, the scene transitions back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes should resolve the QA issues while maintaining the intended game flow and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

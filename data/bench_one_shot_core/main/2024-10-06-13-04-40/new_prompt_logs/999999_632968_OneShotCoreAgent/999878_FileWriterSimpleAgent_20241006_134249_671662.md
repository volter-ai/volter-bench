Content: To address the issue of not handling ties in speed randomly during the resolution phase, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to determine the order of skill execution that takes into account the possibility of a speed tie.
2. In case of a speed tie, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
3. We'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method to use this new order determination method.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as it's purely a logic change within the scene.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution introduces a new method `_determine_execution_order()` which handles the logic for determining which creature acts first, including the case of a speed tie. The `_resolution_phase()` method has been updated to use this new order determination method.

In the case of a speed tie, the order is randomly shuffled using `random.shuffle()`, ensuring that ties are resolved randomly as specified in the architecture documentation.

These changes address the issue raised in the QA/testing phase while maintaining the existing structure and capabilities of the game engine. The solution doesn't require any changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

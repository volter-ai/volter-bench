Content: To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is causing the FixableException to be raised.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until a battle end condition is met.
2. When the battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` instead of just breaking the loop.
3. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ede7dc8b-c1b7-49b6-9e50-a04e09da22ba
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe.active_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            for creature in player.creatures:

```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends, instead of just breaking the loop. We've also added a `reset_creatures` method to restore the HP of all creatures after the battle, preparing them for the next game.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and allow the game to continue running properly through multiple iterations in the test.

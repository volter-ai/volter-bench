Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The scene is not calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game` at the end of its execution, which is causing the FixableException.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will transition back to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to call this new method when the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns True when the battle is over, so the main loop can exit properly.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 73dd3bc3-9ace-4bf4-837a-1a0bb896dd1c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = 0
        self.battle_ended = False

        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            self.current_turn += 1
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            self.battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()
        
        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose a skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():

            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = max(1, int(weakness_factor * raw_damage))  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle loop continues until `battle_ended` is True.
2. The `check_battle_end` method now properly returns True when a creature's HP reaches 0.
3. After the battle ends, the `end_battle` method is called, which shows a final message and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.

This implementation should resolve both issues:
- The scene will now exit properly when the battle ends.
- The scene will always call `_transition_to_scene` at the end of its execution, avoiding the FixableException.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the identified issues within the capabilities of the engine.

Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not handling the case where creatures have the same speed by randomizing the order of skill execution.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first in that case. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0b237dbd-968e-4858-8d04-08d0f469acc5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player):
        creature = self.player_creature if current_player == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self._execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {damage} damage.")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed. When the speeds are equal, it uses `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first, adhering to the described architecture. The rest of the implementation remains unchanged, maintaining compatibility with the existing models and engine capabilities.

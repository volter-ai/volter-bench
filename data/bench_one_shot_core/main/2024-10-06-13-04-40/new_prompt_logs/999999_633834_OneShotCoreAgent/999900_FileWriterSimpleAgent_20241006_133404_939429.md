Content: I understand the issue, and I'll describe how to fix it and then provide the updated file.

1. Description of the fix:

The problem is in the `_foe_choice_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class. Currently, it's using the `_player_choice_phase` method, which waits for user input. For a bot, we should automatically select a skill without waiting for input.

To fix this, we'll modify the `_foe_choice_phase` method to randomly select a skill from the creature's available skills. This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Import the `random` module if it's not already imported.
2. Modify the `_foe_choice_phase` method to randomly select a skill from the creature's skills.
3. Keep the method signature the same to maintain consistency with the `_player_choice_phase` method.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 28fd3a48-0d02-4805-8621-606624f725eb
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

VS

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

    def _calculate_damage(self, skill: Skill, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature) -> int:
        if skill.is_physical:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation fixes the issue by modifying the `_foe_choice_phase` method to randomly select a skill for the bot opponent. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the overall structure and logic of the game. This solution adheres to the guidelines and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

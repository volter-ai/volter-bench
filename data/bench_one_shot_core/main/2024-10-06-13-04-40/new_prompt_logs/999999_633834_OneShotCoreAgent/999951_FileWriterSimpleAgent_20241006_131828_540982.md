Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle logic is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add logic to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the _check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll update the run method to break the loop when the battle ends and transition to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ae0a973b-1781-4ba6-98b5-b682fa3245b1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}

Opponent's turn:
{self._get_skill_choices_str(self.opponent_creature)}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player):
        creature = self.player_creature if current_player == self.player else self.opponent_creature
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(0, damage)  # Ensure damage is not negative
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)  # Ensure HP doesn't go below 0
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {damage} damage.")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop ends when a creature's HP reaches 0.
2. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, which properly exits the MainGameScene.
3. Using the `_transition_to_scene` method to navigate between scenes, adhering to the engine's architecture.

This solution maintains the existing model structure and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It should resolve the test failures by properly exiting the MainGameScene and allowing the game flow to continue as expected.

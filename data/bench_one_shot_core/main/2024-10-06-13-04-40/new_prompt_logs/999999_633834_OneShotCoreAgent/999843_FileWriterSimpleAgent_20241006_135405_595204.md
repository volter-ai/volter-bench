Content: To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError for 'MainMenuScene' in the App class. The error occurs because we haven't imported the necessary scene classes in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `main.py` file to import the required scene classes.
2. We'll ensure that all necessary imports are present and correctly ordered.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 603e65c2-addc-4e54-868e-fe878e718fba
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This change imports the necessary scene classes (MainMenuScene and MainGameScene) at the beginning of the file. By doing this, we ensure that these classes are available when initializing the App class, resolving the NameError.

The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

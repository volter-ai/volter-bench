Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until explicitly broken.
3. We'll ensure that the scene always exits by transitioning or quitting the game.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 8017647a-181f-4ace-8906-d47f245b4aeb

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():

        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

    def _return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the game loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Adding a `_return_to_main_menu` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
4. Calling `_return_to_main_menu` after resetting the creatures when the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the MainGameScene always exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, addressing both issues raised in the QA/testing. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `transition_to_scene`, and it will properly exit the scene when the battle is over.

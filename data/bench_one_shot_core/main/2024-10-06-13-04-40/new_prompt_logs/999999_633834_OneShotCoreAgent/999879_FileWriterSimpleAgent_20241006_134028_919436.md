Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem and provide a solution that adheres to the architecture documentation and the engine's capabilities.

1. To fix the issue of not implementing a random decision for equal speed in the Resolution Phase, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal, and if so, use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first. This change will ensure that when creatures have equal speed, there's an equal chance for either to act first, as required by the architecture documentation.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

```

This solution addresses the issue by modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to include a random decision when the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal. The changes are as follows:

1. We've added an `elif` condition to check if the player's creature speed is less than the opponent's creature speed.
2. We've added an `else` condition to handle the case when the speeds are equal.
3. In the equal speed case, we use `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.
4. We then execute the skills in the order determined by the random choice.

These changes ensure that when creatures have equal speed, there's an equal chance for either to act first, as required by the architecture documentation. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the structure and functionality of the `MainGameScene` class while addressing the specific issue raised in the QA testing.

Content: To address the proposed changes, we need to create a JSON object that specifies the action to overwrite the specified excerpt in the file. Here is the JSON object formatted according to the provided schema:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "overwrite",
      "excerpt_id": "5c5c2e76-d312-487d-9620-2585d4128d70",
      "file_path": "main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

This JSON object indicates that the specified excerpt in the file `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` should be overwritten with the new content provided in the rewritten code. The `action` is set to "overwrite", the `excerpt_id` matches the one given in the task, and the `file_path` points to the correct file location.

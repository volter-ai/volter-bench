Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since active_creature is marked as optional (Creature | None), we need to properly mark it as a Field with a default value of None in the models.py file.

The fix is to modify the Player class in models.py to explicitly declare active_creature as a Field with a default of None, rather than just using type hints. This matches the engine's expectations for optional fields.

Here's the complete fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 311dc90b-cccd-4fdc-826e-aba6bef3c3f5
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = Field(default=None)
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper Optional type hint import
2. Changed active_creature to use Field(default=None) to properly mark it as optional with a default value
3. Kept the models as pure data schemas
4. Maintained inheritance from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer

This should resolve the validation error while staying within the engine's capabilities and following the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

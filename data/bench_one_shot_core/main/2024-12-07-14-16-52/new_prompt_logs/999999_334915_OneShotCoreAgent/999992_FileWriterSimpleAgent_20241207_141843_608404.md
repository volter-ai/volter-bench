Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling _QuitWholeGame in the test. The test should catch both TransitionFromScene AND _QuitWholeGame exceptions since both are valid ways to exit the scene.

Additionally, the game logic has a bug where it shows "You lost the battle!" followed by "Congratulations! You've won the game!" - we need to fix the control flow.

The solution:
1. Update test to catch _QuitWholeGame
2. Fix the battle end logic to properly handle win/lose conditions
3. Keep using engine patterns (_transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game)
4. Maintain proper game flow

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: fc8dc7e5-d7ef-4004-b487-7428f34ecfc1
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting game via quit")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

And here's the fixed scene file:

        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        
        while True:

            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()

            battle_result = self._check_battle_end()
            if battle_result is not None:
                # Reset creatures before transitioning
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                
                if battle_result:

                    self._quit_whole_game()
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "Better luck next time!")
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        # Apply bot skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        """Returns True for player victory, False for player defeat, None if battle continues"""
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return False
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return None
```

Key changes:
1. Updated test to catch _QuitWholeGame exception
2. Modified _check_battle_end to return True/False/None for better control flow
3. Separated win/lose messages and transitions
4. Fixed the battle end logic to prevent showing both win and lose messages
5. Maintained proper scene transitions and game flow
6. Kept all engine patterns intact

This should resolve the test failure while maintaining proper game architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

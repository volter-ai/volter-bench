Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop without calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

The fix is simple: After the battle ends, we should:
1. Return to the main menu if the player lost
2. Quit the game with a victory message if they won
3. Reset creature HP before transitioning

This maintains the game flow while following engine patterns.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 1ee03534-6298-42ae-a159-1721a03574fe
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

        return f"""=== Battle ===

{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.damage} damage)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Reset creatures before transitioning
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
                
                if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "Congratulations! You've won the game!")
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills
        ]
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your move!")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.player_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills
        ]
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot choosing move...")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply player skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        # Apply bot skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper scene transitions after battle end
2. Reset creature HP before transitioning
3. Return from run() after transitioning to prevent the error
4. Maintain proper game flow - return to menu on loss, quit on win

This maintains the engine's patterns while fixing the scene transition issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because the MainGameScene test isn't properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the battle ends. According to the engine architecture, we need to:

- Catch the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test, similar to how we catch RandomModeGracefulExit
- This matches how the MainMenuScene test handles both transitions and quits
- No changes needed to the models or game logic, just proper test exception handling

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 864ebeac-726c-4f63-97e1-ed0dd60e9390
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for _QuitWholeGame in the test loop
3. Added informative print statement when game ends gracefully

This maintains the engine architecture while properly handling all expected ways the scene can end (random mode timeout or game completion).

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

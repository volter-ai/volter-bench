Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset()`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods or properties. The reset functionality should be moved to the scene logic.

The solution is to:
1. Remove all methods from models.py
2. Move the reset logic to MainGameScene
3. Keep models as pure data schemas
4. Handle all creature/player state management in the scene

Here's the corrected models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: e0c0298b-f27f-4457-b0ed-87d36ed07916
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature = None
    category: str = "player"
```

The reset functionality should now be handled in MainGameScene's initialization and battle logic. The scene will need to:
1. Set hp to max_hp for all creatures when initializing
2. Set initial active_creature
3. Handle creature state changes during battle

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

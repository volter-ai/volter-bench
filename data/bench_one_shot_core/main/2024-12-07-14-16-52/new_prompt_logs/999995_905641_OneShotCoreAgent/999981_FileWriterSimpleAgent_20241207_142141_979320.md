Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that MainGameScene is terminating without properly transitioning or quitting. The issue is in the battle logic where we're using `return` statements which directly exit the scene instead of properly transitioning.

The fix needs to:
- Remove direct returns from the battle logic
- Keep the scene running in its game loop until a proper transition or quit is called
- Maintain proper state tracking for the battle
- Use proper scene transitions

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            # Check win condition
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self.battle_ended = True
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self.battle_ended = True
```

The key changes are:
1. Added battle state tracking with self.battle_ended
2. Removed direct returns from win conditions
3. Main game loop now properly transitions to MainMenuScene when battle ends
4. Maintained all the battle mechanics while ensuring proper scene transitions

This should fix both test failures by ensuring the scene always transitions properly rather than returning directly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods according to the guidelines. 

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene initialization

This follows the architecture principle that all logic should be in scenes, while models should only contain data.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model
2. Moved the HP reset logic directly into MainGameScene's __init__
3. Kept models as pure data schemas

This maintains the separation between data (models) and logic (scenes) while preserving all the functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

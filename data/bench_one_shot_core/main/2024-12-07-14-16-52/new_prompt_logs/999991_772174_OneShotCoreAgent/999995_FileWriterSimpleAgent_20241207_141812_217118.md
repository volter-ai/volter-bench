Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The errors show two related problems:
- MainGameScene ends without calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`
- The tests fail because neither transition method is called

The issue is in the MainGameScene's battle end logic. When a battle ends, we show the result text but don't transition anywhere. According to the engine architecture, every scene must end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene
- Quitting the whole game

Solution:
- After showing the battle result, we should transition back to the MainMenuScene
- This maintains the game loop and follows the engine's requirements
- No changes needed to models since this is purely scene logic

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._handle_bot_turn()
            
            # Resolution
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Reset creatures for next battle
                self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
                self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills
        ]
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your move!")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return self.player_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _handle_bot_turn(self):
        choices = [
            DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills
        ]
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot choosing move...")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return self.bot_creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Apply player skill
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        # Apply bot skill
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Added transition back to MainMenuScene after battle ends
2. Reset creature HP before transitioning
3. Maintained proper scene exit via transition
4. Kept all model references and game logic intact

This should resolve both test failures since the scene now properly exits through a transition.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

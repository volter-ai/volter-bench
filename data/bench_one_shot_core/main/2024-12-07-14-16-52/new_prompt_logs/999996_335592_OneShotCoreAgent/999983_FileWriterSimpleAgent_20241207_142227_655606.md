Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. Instead, the reset logic should be moved to the MainGameScene.

Here's how to fix it:

1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. In MainGameScene, add a helper method to reset creatures
3. Call this helper method when initializing creatures

Here's the corrected models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 459aa226-9fa9-40f4-aa2e-8999b76ff186
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = None
```

And here's the relevant part of MainGameScene that needs to be updated (the reset logic moved from Creature to scene):

# Excerpt ID: 372c51d3-e809-4c4e-a2b7-54977ce9a18c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing, DictionaryChoice
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Initialize creatures
        for p in [self.player, self.bot]:
            for c in p.creatures:
                # Reset creature HP to max_hp
                c.hp = c.max_hp
            p.active_creature = p.creatures[0]

    # ... rest of the file remains the same ...
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature model since models must be pure data schemas
2. Moved the reset logic directly into MainGameScene's initialization
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene rather than calling a method

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while achieving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

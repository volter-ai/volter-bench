Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the player.json prototype data. Since active_creature is marked as optional (Creature | None), we need to explicitly set it to None in the model definition using Field(default=None).

This follows the pattern of pure data schemas and stays within the engine's capabilities by using Field for default values rather than methods or properties.

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: 3c17579b-fde8-4293-b6df-479b853c1758
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)
```

The key change is:
- Changed `active_creature: Creature | None = None` to `active_creature: Creature | None = Field(default=None)`

This properly declares the default value using the engine's Field system rather than a direct Python assignment. This ensures the validation system recognizes the default value during model instantiation.

The rest of the implementation can remain the same since the MainGameScene still handles setting the active_creature after player creation. This fix maintains the separation between data models and game logic while properly initializing the optional field.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

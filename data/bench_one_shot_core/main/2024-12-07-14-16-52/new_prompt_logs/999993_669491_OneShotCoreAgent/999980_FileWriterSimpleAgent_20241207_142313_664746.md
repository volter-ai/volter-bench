Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods. 

Instead of having a reset method in the Creature model, we should:
1. Move all creature reset logic to the MainGameScene
2. Keep Creature as a pure data model with just attributes
3. Handle hp reset by directly setting hp = max_hp in the scene

2. Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: f1e7c53a-cd4e-4c8e-935b-262deb36a02d
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature | None = None
```

The MainGameScene will need to be updated to handle creature hp reset directly in the scene initialization. The reset logic that was previously in the Creature.reset() method should be moved to the scene's __init__ method where we set hp = max_hp for each creature.

Would you like me to show the updated MainGameScene as well?

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

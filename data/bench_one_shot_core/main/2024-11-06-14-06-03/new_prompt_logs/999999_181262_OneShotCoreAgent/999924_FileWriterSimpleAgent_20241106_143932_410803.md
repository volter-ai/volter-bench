Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll call this method in the check_battle_end method when the battle concludes.
3. We'll ensure that the battle_loop method continues until the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 97b48397-02d1-43b2-b2d0-d5e5d52d6397
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()
        self.return_to_main_menu()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]

        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle_loop continues until the battle ends.
2. Adding a return_to_main_menu method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle concludes.
3. Calling return_to_main_menu after resetting the creatures' HP at the end of the battle_loop.

These changes should resolve both the MainGameScene random run test failure and the whole game flow test failure. The scene will now properly exit by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the game to continue or end as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

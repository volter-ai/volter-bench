Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue by modifying the MainGameScene to handle the case where creatures have the same speed.

1. Description of the fix:
We will modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the MainGameScene class to include a check for equal speed. When the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly decide which creature goes first. This approach aligns with the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Rewriting the main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: dc09cd22-178f-49d6-b4b5-3d0f94d3fbd1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.choice([
                (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)

            self._execute_skill(first_attacker, second_attacker, first_skill)
            if second_attacker.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(second_attacker, first_attacker, second_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)

            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")

        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        
        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding a new condition in the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed. When speeds are equal, it randomly selects which creature goes first, maintaining fairness in the battle system as described in the architecture documentation.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, preserving the existing functionality while adding this new feature. This solution should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the provided architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle is ending without properly transitioning or quitting the game.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a game over condition that transitions back to the MainMenuScene or quits the game after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the battle_round method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will either transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: e55e2cec-bdc3-4096-b1a4-ab81113cf0e7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while True:
            battle_ended = self.battle_round()
            if battle_ended:
                self.handle_battle_end()
                break

    def battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
        return self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        if self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill):
            return True
        if self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill):
            return True
        return False

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name} and deals {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")
        
        if defender.hp == 0:
            winner = self.player if defender == self.opponent_creature else self.opponent
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def handle_battle_end(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a return value to the battle_round method to indicate when the battle has ended.
2. Introducing a handle_battle_end method that provides the player with options to play again or quit the game.
3. Ensuring that the scene always exits by either transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the game.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene will now properly exit, either by transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game, addressing the "Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again" error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to modify the resolution phase in the MainGameScene to randomize the order of execution when both creatures have the same speed. This aligns with the architecture specification and improves the game's fairness and unpredictability.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. In the `resolution_phase` method of the MainGameScene, we'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
2. If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly determine which creature goes first.
3. We'll then execute the skills based on this randomized order.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models, which are already correctly implemented as pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 60e2ba5e-b406-45a9-924a-e37a3d1a2a81
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Handle end of battle
        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly determine who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(1, damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        # Add a small delay to allow the player to read the result
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        
        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where both creatures have the same speed by randomly determining the order of execution. This aligns with the architecture specification and should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the missing random decision for equal speed in the skill execution order.

1. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use a random decision in that case. Here's how we'll do it:

   - We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If they're equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - We'll then execute the skills in the order determined by this logic.

This solution aligns with the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as it's purely a logic change within the scene.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f8c3b361-cab8-4545-b426-d3a079701cad
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

            return True

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp

```

This updated implementation now correctly handles the case of equal speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first, as specified in the architecture documentation. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining consistency with the existing implementation and the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Players** manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creatures** are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's resistance to damage against attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | 10 hp | 3 attack | 2 defense | 4 speed | Skills: tackle
- "Scizard" | 11 hp | 3 attack | 3 defense | 3 speed | Skills: tackle

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" | Has a bubwool
- "Basic Opponent" | Has a scizard

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```
The calculated damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

Use the engine above to create a game based on the architecture markdowns 

The folder structure should be as follows:
- mini_game_engine
  - engine
    - lib.py (this is already implemented)

- main_game (all your files should be written here)
  - content
    - {model name}.json
  - scenes
    - {scene name}.py
  - tests
    - test_{scene name}.py
  - models.py
  - main.py (the entrypoint)

Relevant existing files (that you should rewrite if needed):

```






Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements.

Plan:

1. Update `models.py`:
   - Import necessary modules
   - Define Skill, Creature, and Player models inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
   - Ensure proper ordering of model definitions to avoid circular dependencies

2. Create JSON files for content:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes

3. Update `main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement the logic for playing or quitting the game
   - Add transition to MainGameScene when "Play" is selected

4. Create `main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement the battle logic with phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
   - Handle skill execution and damage calculation
   - Check for battle end conditions

5. Update `main.py`:
   - Register MainGameScene
   - Ensure proper creation of players and bots

6. Create test files:
   - `test_main_menu_scene.py`: Implement random run test
   - `test_main_game_scene.py`: Implement random run test

Now, I'll write out each file according to this plan:

Content: To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game when it should.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene and transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game when the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle.
2. In this method, we'll give the player a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `_handle_battle_end` method that is called when the battle ends.
2. Giving the player a choice to play again or quit after the battle ends.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to return to the MainMenuScene if the player chooses to play again.
4. Using `_quit_whole_game` if the player chooses to quit.

This solution ensures that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by quitting the game. It should resolve both the issue in the MainGameScene random run test and the full game flow test.

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The code is mostly correct and aligns well with the described architecture. However, there is a missing implementation for handling the case where creatures have the same speed, which should result in a random decision of which creature goes first. This discrepancy is significant enough to consider the code as not fully correct according to the provided architecture documentation.",
  "qa_result": "failed"
}



Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

Content: Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue by modifying the MainGameScene to handle the case where creatures have the same speed.

1. Description of the fix:
We will modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the MainGameScene class to include a check for equal speed. When the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly decide which creature goes first. This approach aligns with the architecture documentation and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

2. Rewriting the main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, second_attacker = random.choice([
                (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
            ])
            first_skill = player_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else foe_skill
            second_skill = foe_skill if first_attacker == self.player_creature else player_skill

            self._execute_skill(first_attacker, second_attacker, first_skill)
            if second_attacker.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(second_attacker, first_attacker, second_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        
        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding a new condition in the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the case where creatures have the same speed. When speeds are equal, it randomly selects which creature goes first, maintaining fairness in the battle system as described in the architecture documentation.

The rest of the file remains unchanged, preserving the existing functionality while adding this new feature. This solution should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the provided architecture.

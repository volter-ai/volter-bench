Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue:

1. To fix the issue of missing random decision for equal speed in skill execution order, we'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal, and if so, use Python's `random.choice` to randomly determine which creature goes first.

Here's how we'll implement this fix:

1. We'll import the `random` module at the top of the file.
2. In the `resolve_turn` method, we'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
3. If speeds are equal, we'll use `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.
4. We'll then execute the skills based on this random selection.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: bc5cf5a0-fdaa-4f36-91a9-889c355a0797
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):

            # If speeds are equal, randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5

        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, creature_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now includes the random decision for equal speed in skill execution order. When the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal, the code will randomly choose which creature goes first, adding an element of unpredictability to the battle when speeds are tied.

This change adheres to the specified architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require any changes to the models, as it only affects the game logic within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to reset the player's creature's state when transitioning out of the `MainGameScene`. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` class to include a method that resets the creatures' states.
2. We'll call this reset method just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns. The models will remain pure data schemas, and we'll handle the state reset within the scene logic.

Here's the updated `MainGameScene` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 5edfc552-930b-4c72-96a8-95161c9ce171
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

                self.reset_creatures_state()

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True

        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This solution adds a new `reset_creatures_state` method to the `MainGameScene` class. This method resets the HP of all creatures (both for the player and the opponent) to their maximum HP. The method is called just before transitioning back to the `MainMenuScene`, ensuring that the creatures' states are reset when leaving the battle scene.

This change addresses the issue raised in the QA pass while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and the game logic for resetting the state is handled within the scene, as per the guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

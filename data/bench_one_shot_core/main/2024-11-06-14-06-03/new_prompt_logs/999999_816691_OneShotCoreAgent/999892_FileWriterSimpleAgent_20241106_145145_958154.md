Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the missing `active_creature` field in the Player model. The error occurs because the `Player` class expects an `active_creature` attribute, but it's not being set when creating a player from the prototype.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `Player` class in `models.py` to make the `active_creature` field optional. This way, we can create a Player instance without immediately setting an active creature.

2. We'll update the `_initialize_battle` method in the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` for both players at the start of the battle.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0911c0e2-1132-425c-9d8f-a19682760c11
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change makes the `active_creature` field optional by setting its default value to `None`. This allows us to create a `Player` instance without immediately setting an active creature.

Now, we need to update the `MainGameScene` to set the `active_creature` at the start of the battle. Here's the updated `_initialize_battle` method:

# Excerpt ID: 79967895-5cb5-4262-853f-27998c3026dc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
# ... (keep the existing imports and class definition)

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    # ... (keep the existing methods)

    def _initialize_battle(self):
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} sent out {self.player.active_creature.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{self.opponent.display_name} sent out {self.opponent.active_creature.display_name}!")

    # ... (keep the rest of the class implementation)
```

These changes should resolve the ValidationError we were seeing. The `Player` can now be created without an `active_creature`, and the `active_creature` is set at the beginning of the battle in the `MainGameScene`.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns between the data models and the game logic. The `models.py` file remains a pure data schema, while the game logic for initializing the battle is kept in the `MainGameScene`.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the game loop in MainGameScene continues until the battle is over.
3. We'll add a check for the end of the battle after each turn resolution.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as the issue is with the game logic in the MainGameScene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. Added a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modified the `run` method to continue the game loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Added checks for `battle_ended` after each player's turn and during turn resolution.
4. Updated `_force_swap` to set `battle_ended` to True if a player has no more creatures.
5. Modified `_check_battle_end` to set `battle_ended` to True when the battle ends.
6. Ensured that `_end_battle` is called when the battle ends, which transitions to the MainMenuScene.

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, and by making sure the game loop continues until the battle is over. This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture without modifying the models.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

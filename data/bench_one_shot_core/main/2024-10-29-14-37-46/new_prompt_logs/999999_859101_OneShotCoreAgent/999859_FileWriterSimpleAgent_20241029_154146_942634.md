## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing regarding the handling of equal speed creatures, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The solution will involve implementing the logic for randomly deciding which creature goes first when their speeds are equal, as described in the documentation.

Here's how I will fix the issue:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method of the `MainGameScene` class, I will modify the sorting logic of the `turn_queue` to include a random tiebreaker for creatures with equal speed.

2. I will use Python's `random.random()` function to generate a random value for each action in the turn queue. This random value will be used as a tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

3. The sorting key for the `turn_queue` will be updated to consider this random tiebreaker value when speeds are equal.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ab2d9543-6b53-4179-8acb-ea2d8446ba6f

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):

```

This solution addresses the issue by implementing the random tiebreaker for creatures with equal speed. The key changes are:

1. In the `_player_choice_phase` method, we now add a random value to each action in the turn queue.
2. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've updated the sorting key for the `turn_queue` to consider this random value when speeds are equal.

These changes ensure that when two creatures have the same speed, the order in which they act is decided randomly, as specified in the architecture documentation. This implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't modify the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

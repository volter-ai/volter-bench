## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of missing reset logic for the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `_reset_creatures` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will reset the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their max_hp.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of concerns, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 72f96946-fa95-41e2-bfc0-0a8d7f47779a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.damage} damage" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

            if quit_button == choice:
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._quit_whole_game()

            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices).thing

            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]).thing

            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by adding the `_reset_creatures` method, which resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum HP. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene and when quitting the game, ensuring that the creatures' states are properly reset for the next battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

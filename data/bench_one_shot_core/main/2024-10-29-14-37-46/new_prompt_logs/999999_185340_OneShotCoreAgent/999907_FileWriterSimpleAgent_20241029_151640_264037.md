## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement the resetting of the player's creatures' state when transitioning out of the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a method in the MainGameScene to reset the creatures' state.
2. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 98f7c5c6-168f-429c-97e3-720cc7119a9e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                # Reset creatures' state
                self.reset_creatures_state()
                # Transition back to the main menu
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation adds a new `reset_creatures_state` method that resets the HP of all creatures for both the player and the opponent to their maximum values. This method is called just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the creatures' state is reset when leaving the battle scene.

This solution addresses the issue raised in the QA testing while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and we've only modified the scene logic to include the required state reset.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

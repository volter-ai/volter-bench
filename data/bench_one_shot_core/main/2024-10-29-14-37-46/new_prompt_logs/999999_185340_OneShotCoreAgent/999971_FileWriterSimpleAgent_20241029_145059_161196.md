## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.
2. We'll update the battle_loop method to break out of the loop when check_battle_end returns True, and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll add a method to display the battle result before transitioning.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 108d81d7-c735-4d45-96ac-9f969a3acfe4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.end_battle()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the battle loop ends when a creature's HP reaches 0.
2. Adding an `end_battle` method that displays the battle result and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
3. Calling `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` at the end of the battle, which properly exits the scene and prevents the FixableException from being raised.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the issues identified in the QA/testing process. The MainGameScene now properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, regardless of the outcome.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle_loop method to break out of the loop when the battle ends and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll add a method to display the final battle result before transitioning.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow of the game.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 79bf4c68-fa4b-4905-9013-78fdd6810242
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_result = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.show_battle_result()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_turn()

            first, second = self._determine_turn_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            self._resolve_turn(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            self._resolve_turn(*second)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _determine_turn_order(self, player_data, opponent_data):
        if player_data[1].speed > opponent_data[1].speed:
            return player_data, opponent_data
        elif player_data[1].speed < opponent_data[1].speed:
            return opponent_data, player_data
        else:
            return random.sample([player_data, opponent_data], 2)

    def _resolve_turn(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
        defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        type_factor = self._calculate_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _calculate_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.battle_result = "lose"
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self.battle_result = "win"
            return True
        return False

    def show_battle_result(self):
        if self.battle_result == "win":
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
        elif self.battle_result == "lose":
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle ended in an unexpected way.")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `run` method always transitions to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. Adding a `battle_result` attribute to store the outcome of the battle.
3. Creating a `show_battle_result` method to display the final result before transitioning.
4. Updating the `_check_battle_end` method to set the `battle_result` instead of showing the text immediately.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by properly exiting the MainGameScene and following the expected game flow.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

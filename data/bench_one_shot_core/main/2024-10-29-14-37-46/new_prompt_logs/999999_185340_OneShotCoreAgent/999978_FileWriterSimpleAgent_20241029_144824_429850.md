## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA pass, I'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement a queue for skills:
   - Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class.
   - Modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to add chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
   - Create a new `_execute_skill_queue` method to process the queued skills.

2. Implement resetting the state of player's creatures:
   - Add a `_reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max_hp.
   - Call this method before transitioning out of the scene.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

# Excerpt ID: 09a494d3-77d1-4826-b027-5c05560fcd18
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[tuple[Creature, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player turn
            self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn, {self.player.display_name}!")
            self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe turn
            self._show_text(self.foe, f"It's your turn, {self.foe.display_name}!")
            self._player_choice_phase(self.foe, self.foe_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            self._execute_skill_queue()

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, [use_skill_button, quit_button])

        if quit_button == choice:
            self._reset_creatures()
            self._quit_whole_game()

        skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        chosen_skill = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, skill_choices).thing
        self.skill_queue.append((current_creature, chosen_skill))

    def _execute_skill_queue(self):
        for creature, skill in self.skill_queue:
            if creature == self.player_creature:
                target = self.foe_creature
                attacker = self.player
                defender = self.foe
            else:
                target = self.player_creature
                attacker = self.foe
                defender = self.player

            self._apply_damage(target, skill.damage)
            self._show_text(attacker, f"Your {creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(defender, f"Opponent's {creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

        self.skill_queue.clear()

    def _apply_damage(self, creature, damage):
        creature.hp = max(0, creature.hp - damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.foe.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

        self._show_text(self.player, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")
        self._show_text(self.foe, "All creatures have been restored to full health.")

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA pass:

1. The `skill_queue` is now explicitly implemented, with skills being added to the queue during the choice phase and executed in the resolution phase.
2. The `_reset_creatures` method is implemented and called before transitioning out of the scene, ensuring that all creatures' HP is reset to their max_hp.

The implementation now aligns more closely with the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

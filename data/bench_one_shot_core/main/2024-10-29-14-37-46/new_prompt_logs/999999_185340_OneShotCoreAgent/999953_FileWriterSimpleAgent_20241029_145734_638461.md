## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this important detail in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue by implementing the speed tie-breaking mechanism as described in the architecture documents.

1. To fix this issue, we will modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll implement a random tie-breaker when the speed of both creatures is equal. Here's how we'll do it:

   - Compare the speed of both creatures.
   - If speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - Execute the skills in the order determined by the speed comparison or random selection.

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to incorporate this change. The rest of the file will remain the same, focusing only on fixing the speed tie issue.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b3b8793d-3581-4105-95a2-ff207486458f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._handle_battle_end()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first, second = (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill), (self.player_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # Speed tie, randomly decide who goes first
            creatures = [(self.player_creature, player_skill), (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill)]
            first, second = random.sample(creatures, k=2)
            self._show_text(self.player, "Speed tie! The order is decided randomly.")

        self._execute_skill(first[0], second[0], first[1])
        if second[0].hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second[0], first[0], second[1])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def _handle_battle_end(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended! What would you like to do?")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `_resolution_phase` method to handle speed ties correctly.
2. When speeds are equal, it uses `random.sample()` to randomly decide the order of skill execution.
3. It informs the player when a speed tie occurs and that the order is decided randomly.

These changes ensure that the implementation aligns with the architecture documents, specifically addressing the requirement to handle speed ties randomly during the resolution phase. The rest of the game logic remains intact, and we've stayed within the capabilities of the engine without modifying any models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

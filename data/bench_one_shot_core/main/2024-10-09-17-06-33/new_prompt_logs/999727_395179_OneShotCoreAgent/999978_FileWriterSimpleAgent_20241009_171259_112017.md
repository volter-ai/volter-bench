## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the game ends.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes in the MainGameScene, specifically the turn_queue.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends (either when a player wins or loses).
2. We'll modify the turn_queue to be a serializable attribute by using simple data types instead of complex objects.

These changes will maintain the current architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the main issues:

1. We've added a transition back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the game_loop method. This ensures that the scene properly exits when the battle ends.

2. We've modified the turn_queue to store only serializable data (player UIDs and prototype IDs) instead of complex objects. This should resolve the warnings about unserializable attributes.

3. We've added a get_player method to retrieve the correct player object based on the UID stored in the turn_queue.

4. We've updated the resolution_phase method to work with the new serializable turn_queue format.

These changes maintain the current architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is kept within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

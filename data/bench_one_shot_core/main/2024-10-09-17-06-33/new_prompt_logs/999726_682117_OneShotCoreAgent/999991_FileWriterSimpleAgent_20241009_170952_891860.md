## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The `run` method in `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches 0), we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the battle loop until there's a winner, and then transition to the main menu.

Here's the proposed solution for the `MainGameScene`:

# Excerpt ID: 1057985d-41f3-443a-8315-433a1060b0c5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` properly transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends. The `run` method now continues the battle loop until there's a winner, and then transitions to the main menu using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

This solution maintains the existing architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't modify any models, keeping them as pure data schemas, and it follows the guidelines for scene implementation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

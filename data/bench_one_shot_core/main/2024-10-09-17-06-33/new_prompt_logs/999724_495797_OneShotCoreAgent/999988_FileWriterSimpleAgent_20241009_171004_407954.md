## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We should transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle concludes, whether the player wins or loses.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Add a transition to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. Remove the while loop in the `run` method and instead use a single battle sequence.
3. Ensure that the scene exits properly after the battle concludes.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: bfe2de0e-035c-498d-b796-357ede3fd417
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

> Use Skill
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self.player_turn()
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                break
            self.opponent_turn()

        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_turn(self):
        use_skill_button = Button("Use Skill")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [use_skill_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if use_skill_button == choice:
            skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            skill_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, skill_choices)
            self.use_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, skill_choice.thing)
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()

    def opponent_turn(self):
        skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self.use_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, skill)

    def use_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    @staticmethod
    def calculate_weakness_factor(skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2.0
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by ensuring that the scene always exits properly. The main changes are:

1. The `run` method now uses a while loop to continue the battle until one of the creatures' HP reaches 0.
2. After the battle concludes (win or lose), we call `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` to return to the main menu.
3. The overall structure of the battle logic remains the same, maintaining the turn-based system and skill usage.

These changes should resolve the test failure by ensuring that the scene always exits in an expected manner, either by transitioning to the main menu or quitting the game entirely.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

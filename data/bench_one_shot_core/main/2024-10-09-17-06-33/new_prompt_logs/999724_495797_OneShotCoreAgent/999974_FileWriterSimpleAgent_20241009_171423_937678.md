## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two minor adjustments to the MainGameScene:

1. Implement random resolution for equal speeds during the resolution phase.
2. Explicitly convert the final damage calculation from float to integer.

These changes can be made within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we'll add a random factor to break ties when speeds are equal.
2. In the _calculate_damage method, we'll use the int() function to explicitly convert the final damage to an integer.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: fa64a709-95e2-492a-8b74-7fc9bbdb6bd2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        foe_creature = self.foe.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

```

The changes made to address the issues are:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we added `random.random()` as a third key in the sorting function. This ensures that when speeds are equal, the order is determined randomly:

# Excerpt ID: 386fa43d-a11a-49cc-a395-6ce7db16964f
```python
actions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1] != "swap", -x[0].active_creature.speed, random.random()))
```

2. In the `_calculate_damage` method, we explicitly convert the final damage to an integer using the `int()` function:

# Excerpt ID: da71b7e5-9a2f-450e-8160-5bbe3c12ef48
```python
final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA testing while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game. The modifications are within the capabilities of the engine and do not require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

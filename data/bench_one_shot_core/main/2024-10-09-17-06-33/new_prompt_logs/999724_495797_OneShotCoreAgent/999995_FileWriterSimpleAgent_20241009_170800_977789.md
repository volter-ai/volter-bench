## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. We'll update the main game loop to check for the battle end condition and transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game based on the player's choice.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f726574a-80cd-4ece-aced-2585f5be7ee5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_ended, winner = self._check_battle_end()
            if battle_ended:
                self._show_battle_result(winner)
                self._handle_post_battle()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player, current_creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in current_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._apply_damage(self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        self._apply_damage(self.player_creature, foe_skill)

    def _apply_damage(self, target, skill):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            return True, self.opponent
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            return True, self.player
        return False, None

    def _show_battle_result(self, winner):
        if winner == self.player:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

    def _handle_post_battle(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Modifying the `_check_battle_end` method to return both a boolean indicating if the battle has ended and the winner of the battle.
2. Adding a `_show_battle_result` method to display the battle outcome to the player.
3. Implementing a `_handle_post_battle` method that gives the player the option to play again or quit the game.
4. Updating the main game loop to use these new methods and properly exit the scene when the battle ends.

These modifications ensure that the scene will always exit properly, either by transitioning to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game entirely. This should resolve both the issues observed in the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

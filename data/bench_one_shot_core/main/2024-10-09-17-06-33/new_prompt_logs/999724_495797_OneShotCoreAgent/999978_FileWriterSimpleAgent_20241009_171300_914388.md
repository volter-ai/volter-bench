## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the battle ends.
2. The turn_queue attribute in MainGameScene is causing serialization warnings.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends (either when a player wins or loses).
2. We'll remove the turn_queue attribute from the MainGameScene class and instead use a local variable within the resolution phase method.

These changes will ensure that the scene properly exits and transitions, and will remove the serialization warnings.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```

These changes address the main issues:

1. We've added a transition back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the game_loop method. This ensures that when the battle ends, the scene properly transitions to another scene instead of just terminating.

2. We've removed the turn_queue attribute and instead pass the actions directly to the _resolution_phase method. This eliminates the serialization warnings related to the turn_queue.

3. The overall structure and logic of the battle remain the same, but now it properly handles the end of the battle by transitioning back to the main menu.

These changes should resolve the test failures and warnings while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's architecture and capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, I'll make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Add explicit handling for the 'Normal' type effectiveness in the `_get_type_factor` method.
2. Implement a method to reset the player's creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.
3. Remove the extra implementation that ensures at least 1 damage is dealt, as it's not part of the original architecture.

Here's how I'll implement these changes:

1. In the `_get_type_factor` method, I'll add a specific case for the 'Normal' type.
2. I'll create a new method called `_reset_creatures` that resets the HP of both player and opponent creatures to their max HP. This method will be called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.
3. In the `_calculate_damage` method, I'll remove the `max(1, final_damage)` call and simply return the calculated `final_damage`.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'Normal' type effectiveness is now explicitly handled in the `_get_type_factor` method.
2. The `_reset_creatures` method has been added to reset the player's and opponent's creature states when transitioning out of MainGameScene.
3. The extra implementation to ensure at least 1 damage is dealt has been removed from the `_calculate_damage` method.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation between models and game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged, keeping the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because `player_skill` and `foe_skill` are not defined in the `_determine_order` method. We need to modify the `MainGameScene` to properly handle the skills chosen by the player and the opponent. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `game_loop` method to pass the chosen skills to the `_resolution_phase` method.
2. We'll update the `_resolution_phase` method to handle the skills separately from the creatures and players.
3. We'll modify the `_determine_order` method to only deal with creatures and players, not skills.
4. We'll update the `_execute_skill` method to use the correct skill for each creature.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

These changes address the NameError by properly passing and using the skills chosen by each player. The main modifications are:

1. The `game_loop` method now passes both players, creatures, and skills to the `_resolution_phase`.
2. The `_resolution_phase` method has been updated to accept all these parameters and pass them correctly to `_determine_order` and `_execute_skill`.
3. The `_determine_order` method now returns tuples that include the skills along with the players and creatures.
4. The `_execute_skill` method now takes the skill as a parameter instead of trying to access it from a non-existent variable.

These changes should resolve the NameError and allow the game to run properly. The structure still adheres to the engine's capabilities and maintains the separation between models and game logic.

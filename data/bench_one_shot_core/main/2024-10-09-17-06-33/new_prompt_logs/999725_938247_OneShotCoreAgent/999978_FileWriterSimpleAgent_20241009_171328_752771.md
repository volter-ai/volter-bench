## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because `skill1` and `skill2` are not defined in the `_determine_order` method. We need to modify the `MainGameScene` to properly handle the skills chosen by the player and the opponent. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `_determine_order` method to accept the skills as parameters.
2. We'll update the `_resolution_phase` method to pass the skills to `_determine_order`.
3. We'll ensure that all methods consistently use the passed skills.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation between models and game logic. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

```

This updated version of `main_game_scene.py` should resolve the NameError by properly passing and using the skills chosen by each player. The main changes are:

1. The `_determine_order` method now accepts `skill1` and `skill2` as parameters.
2. The `_resolution_phase` method has been updated to pass the skills to `_determine_order`.

These changes should allow the game to run without the NameError, while maintaining the structure that adheres to the engine's capabilities and the separation between models and game logic.

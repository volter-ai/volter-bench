## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle loop is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `battle_loop` method in the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle.
2. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP at the start of each battle to ensure multiple battles can be played.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 5735e4e8-07ac-4a42-819b-a75fd8fa6dc9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # After the battle ends, transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order()
        self.execute_skill(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player else foe_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, foe_skill if first == self.player else player_skill)

    def determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        attacker_creature = attacker.creatures[0]
        defender_creature = defender.creatures[0]
        damage = max(0, attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to ensure creatures start with full HP for each battle.
2. Modifying the `battle_loop` to break out of the loop when the battle ends.
3. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions to another scene when the battle is over. The scene will no longer terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

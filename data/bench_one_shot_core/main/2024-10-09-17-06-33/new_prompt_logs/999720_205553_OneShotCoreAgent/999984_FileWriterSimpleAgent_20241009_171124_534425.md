## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem by implementing the random decision for execution order when creatures have equal speed in the Resolution Phase.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use Python's `random.choice` to determine the order of skill execution when speeds are equal. This change will align with the architecture specification and improve gameplay balance and fairness.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f8e30161-36f5-4f18-84c4-c95bc574b390
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

                break

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):

            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

        else:
            # Equal speed: randomly decide who goes first
            first, second = random.choice([
                (self.player_creature, self.player_skill, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self._execute_skill(first[0], second[0], first[1])

             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle("You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

    def _end_battle(self, result_message):
        self._show_text(self.player, result_message)
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case when creatures have equal speed by randomly deciding the order of skill execution. This change aligns with the architecture specification and improves gameplay balance and fairness.

The models remain unchanged, as they are already properly defined as pure data schemas in the `models.py` file. The solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

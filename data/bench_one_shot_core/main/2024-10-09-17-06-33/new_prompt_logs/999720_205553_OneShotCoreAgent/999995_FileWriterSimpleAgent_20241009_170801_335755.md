## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly between scenes.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow.

2. We'll also add a check to see if the player wants to play again or quit the game after each battle. This will provide a proper game loop and allow the player to exit the game when desired.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: f55ccdb9-40ce-40c3-9c2f-d0cce5d9ddc1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._post_battle_menu()

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def _post_battle_menu(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `_post_battle_menu()` method that gives the player the option to play again or quit after each battle.
2. Using `self._transition_to_scene()` to properly exit the MainGameScene and transition to either a new battle or back to the main menu.

This implementation ensures that the scene always exits properly and provides a clear game loop for the player. It also maintains the structure and capabilities of the engine while fixing the identified issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

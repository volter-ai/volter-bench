## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, we need to make changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix each issue:

1. Implement random resolution for equal speeds: We'll use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly select which creature goes first when speeds are equal.

2. Explicitly convert final damage to an integer: We'll use the `int()` function to ensure the final damage is always an integer.

3. Only reset the player's creatures at the end of the battle: We'll modify the `_end_battle` method to only reset the player's creatures, not the bot's.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes implemented:

These changes address all three issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The resolution of equal speeds is now implemented randomly in the `_resolve_turn` method.
2. The damage calculation now explicitly converts the final damage to an integer in the `_execute_skill` method.
3. The reset of creature states at the end of the battle now only includes the player's creatures in the `_end_battle` method.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

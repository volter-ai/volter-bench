## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when a winner is determined.

2. The test for the full game flow is failing because the game is not properly ending after the battle.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the check_battle_end method returns True when the battle is over, allowing the run method to exit its loop.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 7f0f8bdb-eabd-4390-8867-d62df5b7b82c
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent.display_name} appeared!")
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            
            # Opponent turn
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def opponent_turn(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, skill, target):
        raw_damage = attacker.creatures[0].attack + skill.base_damage - target.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, target.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, target_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and target_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and target_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and target_type == "fire":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "water" and target_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and target_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and target_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends, and that the check_battle_end method correctly signals when the battle is over. This should allow the tests to pass and the game to function as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.
2. The test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of just breaking the loop.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP at the start of each battle, ensuring that multiple battles can be played in succession.
3. We'll modify the `run` method to use a while loop that continues until the player chooses to quit, allowing for multiple battles.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 05e599c8-fac4-4245-99cb-92c5d4a884b1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._reset_creatures()

            if not play_again:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_creatures(self):

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):

            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _ask_play_again(self):

        quit_button = Button("Quit to Main Menu")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])
        return choice == play_again_button
```

These changes address the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene always transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the player chooses to quit, rather than terminating without a proper transition. The addition of the `_reset_creatures` method and the outer while loop in the `run` method allow for multiple battles to be played in succession, which should help the random tests to run through more scenarios without prematurely ending the scene.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and models. The changes are focused on the scene logic, which is where game logic should be implemented according to the guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose a solution for the `main_game_scene.py` file, which is where most of these issues need to be fixed.

1. How to fix the issues:

   a. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:
      - We'll modify the player turn logic to include a 'Back' option when choosing skills or creatures to swap.
      - This will allow the player to return to the main choice between 'Attack' and 'Swap'.

   b. Improve the bot choice phase:
      - We'll make the bot choice phase more similar to the player choice phase, including the possibility of going 'Back'.

   c. Clarify float usage in damage calculations:
      - We'll ensure that all damage calculations use floats until the final step, where we'll convert to an integer.

   d. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
      - We'll add a method to check if the active creature's HP is zero after each action.
      - If it is, we'll force the player (or bot) to swap to another creature with non-zero HP.

   e. Ensure all aspects of the architecture are implemented:
      - We'll double-check that all features described in the architecture are present in the implementation.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. Added a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase for both skill selection and creature swapping.
2. Improved the bot choice phase to be more similar to the player choice phase.
3. Clarified float usage in damage calculations by using floats throughout the calculation and only converting to an integer at the final step.
4. Implemented forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero using the `_check_and_force_swap` method.
5. Ensured all aspects of the architecture are implemented, including the correct order of operations and type effectiveness calculations.

These changes should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

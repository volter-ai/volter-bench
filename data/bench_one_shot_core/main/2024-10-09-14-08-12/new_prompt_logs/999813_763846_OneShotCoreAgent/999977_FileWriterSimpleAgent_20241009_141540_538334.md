## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You're right, and I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method to the `Player` class, which violates the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the `from_prototype_id` method from the `Player` class and handle the initialization of the `active_creature` elsewhere in the code, likely in the `App` class where we create the player.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` method from the `Player` class in `models.py`.
2. Keep the `active_creature` field as `Optional[Creature] = None`.
3. Modify the `create_player` method in the `App` class to initialize the `active_creature`.

Now, let's rewrite the `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 102b2698-5653-4ae0-974e-11af5e869a56
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This solution keeps the `Player` class as a pure data schema without any methods, adhering to the guidelines.

To complete the fix, we also need to update the `main.py` file to initialize the `active_creature` when creating a player. Here's the updated `main.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: b38b0c5c-1f18-4cbe-b34d-a5fdf44041af
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes should resolve the issue while maintaining the pure data schema nature of the models and adhering to the architecture guidelines. The `Player` class no longer has any methods, and the initialization of `active_creature` is handled in the `App` class where we create the player and bot instances.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not explicitly showing the opponent's creature's list of available skills during the Foe Choice Phase, we need to modify the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll create a new method `_show_creature_skills` that displays the skills of a given creature.
2. We'll modify the `_player_choice_phase` method to show the skills for both the player and the opponent.
3. We'll update the `__str__` method to include both creatures' skills.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as they are already pure data schemas.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

        # If there are any other state variables that need to be reset, do it here
```

The main changes in this updated version are:

1. We've updated the `__str__` method to include the skills of both the player's and opponent's creatures.
2. We've added a new method `_show_creature_skills` that displays the skills of a given creature.
3. We've modified the `_player_choice_phase` method to call `_show_creature_skills` before presenting the choices, ensuring that the skills are shown for both the player and the opponent.

These changes ensure that the opponent's creature's list of available skills is explicitly shown during the Foe Choice Phase, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture without modifying the models.

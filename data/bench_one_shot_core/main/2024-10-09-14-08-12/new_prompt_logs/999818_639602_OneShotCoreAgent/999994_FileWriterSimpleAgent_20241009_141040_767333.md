## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I'll modify the `MainGameScene` to include an explicit queue for skills and remove them from the queue as they are executed. This change will align the implementation more closely with the described architecture.

Here's how I'll fix the issue:

1. Add a `skill_queue` attribute to the `MainGameScene` class to store the queued skills.
2. Modify the player and foe choice phases to add the chosen skills to the queue instead of returning them directly.
3. Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queue and remove them as they are executed.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 075948e9-9c11-47cd-b566-52188c80bb3d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List, Tuple

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue: List[Tuple[Creature, Skill]] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}

Skill Queue:
{', '.join(f"{creature.display_name}'s {skill.display_name}" for creature, skill in self.skill_queue)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.player_creature, choice.thing))

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        self.skill_queue.append((self.foe_creature, choice.thing))

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            creature, skill = self.skill_queue.pop(0)
            if creature == self.player_creature:
                target = self.foe_creature
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            else:
                target = self.player_creature
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            
            target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self.reset_creatures()
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
        self.skill_queue.clear()
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `skill_queue` attribute to store the queued skills.
2. Modifying the `player_choice_phase` and `foe_choice_phase` methods to add chosen skills to the queue.
3. Updating the `resolution_phase` method to process skills from the queue and remove them as they are executed.
4. Updating the `__str__` method to display the current skill queue.

These changes align the implementation more closely with the described architecture by explicitly using a queue for skills and removing them from the queue as they are executed.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

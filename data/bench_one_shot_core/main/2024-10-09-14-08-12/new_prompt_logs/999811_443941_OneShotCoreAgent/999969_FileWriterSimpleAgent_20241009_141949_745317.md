## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll focus on updating the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Implement equal speed resolution in the resolution phase by adding a random tiebreaker when creatures have the same speed.
2. Handle forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero by adding a method to check for knocked-out creatures and prompt for swaps.
3. Explicitly inform the loser of their loss by adding a message in the battle end check.
4. Ensure the use of floats throughout damage calculations by explicitly casting relevant values to float.

Here's the updated `main_game_scene.py` file with these fixes implemented:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Equal speed resolution is now implemented in the `_resolution_phase` method by adding `random.random()` as a tiebreaker in the sorting key.
2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is handled in the new `_check_and_handle_knocked_out_creatures` method, which is called after each action in the resolution phase.
3. The loser is explicitly informed of their loss in the `_check_battle_end` method.
4. Floats are now used throughout the damage calculations in the `_calculate_damage` method by explicitly casting relevant values to float.

These changes should resolve the issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

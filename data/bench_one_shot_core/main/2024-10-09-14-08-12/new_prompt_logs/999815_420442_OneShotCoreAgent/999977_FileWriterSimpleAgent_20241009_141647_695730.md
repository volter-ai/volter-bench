## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Implement random selection when creatures have equal speed.
2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the scene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, we'll add a random selection when the speeds are equal.
2. We'll add a new method `_reset_creatures` to reset the HP of all creatures to their max HP.
3. We'll call `_reset_creatures` before transitioning back to the main menu.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 18f01b38-8e5a-4d86-acc5-56fa8c246f31
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")

            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):

        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
                if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)
                if self.player_creature.hp > 0:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Implementing a random selection when creatures have equal speed in the `_resolution_phase` method.
2. Adding a new `_reset_creatures` method to reset the HP of all creatures to their max HP.
3. Calling `_reset_creatures` before transitioning back to the main menu at the end of the `run` method.

These modifications should resolve the QA issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

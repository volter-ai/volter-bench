## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Remove the minimum damage of 1 enforcement.
2. Ensure that the type factor is applied after calculating the raw damage.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models. We'll only need to modify the `main_game_scene.py` file.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 063255dd-8d18-44f7-a19f-3ccfa1b3fd59
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

            return True

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Removing the `max(1, final_damage)` enforcement in the `_calculate_damage` method, allowing the damage to be 0 or negative if that's the result of the calculation.
2. Ensuring that the type factor is applied after calculating the raw damage, as it was already correctly implemented.

These modifications should resolve the QA issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

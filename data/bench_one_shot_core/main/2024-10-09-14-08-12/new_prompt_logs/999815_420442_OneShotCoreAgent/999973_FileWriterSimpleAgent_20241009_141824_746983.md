## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

1. Add explicit handling for the 'Normal' type effectiveness.
2. Include type effectiveness messages during skill use.
3. Handle simultaneous fainting of creatures.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. Update the `_get_type_factor` method to include 'Normal' type and return a message about effectiveness.
2. Modify the `_execute_skill` method to include the effectiveness message in the battle text.
3. Update the `_check_battle_end` method to handle simultaneous fainting.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 20beaada-8ffe-4363-a2d1-5fb332230f9b

        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding explicit handling for the 'Normal' type effectiveness in the `_get_type_factor` method.
2. Including type effectiveness messages during skill use in the `_execute_skill` method.
3. Handling simultaneous fainting of creatures in the `_check_battle_end` method.

These modifications should resolve the QA issues while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

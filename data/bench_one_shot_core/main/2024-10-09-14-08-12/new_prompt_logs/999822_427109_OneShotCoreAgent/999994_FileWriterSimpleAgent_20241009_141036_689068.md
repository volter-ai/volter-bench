## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, I will modify the `MainGameScene` to explicitly implement the removal of skills from a queue as they are executed during the Resolution Phase. Here's how I plan to fix this:

1. Add a queue for player and bot skills in the `MainGameScene` class.
2. Modify the choice phases to add the chosen skills to their respective queues.
3. Update the resolution phase to process skills from the queues and remove them as they are executed.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture requirements. Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 164c4536-cad8-45a9-8e65-94fced621310
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from typing import List

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue: List[Skill] = []
        self.bot_skill_queue: List[Skill] = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.bot_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_state()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def bot_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        self.bot_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.player_skill_queue or self.bot_skill_queue:
            if self.player_skill_queue:
                player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
                self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage

            if self.bot_skill_queue:
                bot_skill = self.bot_skill_queue.pop(0)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"The wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
                self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lost!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted. You won!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_state(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self.player_skill_queue.clear()
        self.bot_skill_queue.clear()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation of `MainGameScene` now explicitly implements the removal of skills from a queue as they are executed during the Resolution Phase. The `player_skill_queue` and `bot_skill_queue` are added to store the chosen skills, and the `resolution_phase` method processes these queues, removing skills as they are executed. This change addresses the issue raised during QA/testing while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

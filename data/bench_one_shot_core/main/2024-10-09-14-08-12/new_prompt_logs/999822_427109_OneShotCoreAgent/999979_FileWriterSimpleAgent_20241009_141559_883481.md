## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each problem and propose solutions that align with the game's architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities.

1. Proposed fixes:

a) Correct the damage calculation for special skills:
   We'll modify the formula to match the architecture specification.

b) Handle final damage as integers:
   We'll ensure all damage calculations result in integers.

c) Update messaging for battle outcomes:
   We'll adjust the text to match the architecture specifications.

d) Remove the reset of opponent's creatures:
   We'll only reset the player's creatures when transitioning out of MainGameScene.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation for special skills now uses the correct formula: `(attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage`.
2. All damage calculations result in integers using the `int()` function.
3. The battle outcome messages have been updated to "You are the winner." and "You are the loser." as specified.
4. The `_reset_player_creatures` method now only resets the player's creatures, not the opponent's.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the game's architecture and staying within the engine's capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

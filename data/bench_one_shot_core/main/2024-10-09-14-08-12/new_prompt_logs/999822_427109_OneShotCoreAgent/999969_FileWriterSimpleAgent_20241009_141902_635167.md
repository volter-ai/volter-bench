## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError that's occurring because the `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` are not imported in the `main.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll import the necessary scene classes in the `main.py` file.
2. We'll ensure that all imports are at the top of the file to avoid circular import issues.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 24bfe8d4-972f-4815-9a7f-fc33ced08dbc
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the architecture of the game. By importing the necessary scene classes at the top of the `main.py` file, we ensure that they are available when the `App` class is initialized, resolving the NameError.

The `models.py` file doesn't need to be modified as it already follows the guidelines of being pure data schemas without methods or properties.

This change should resolve the NameError and allow the tests to run without the initial setup errors.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

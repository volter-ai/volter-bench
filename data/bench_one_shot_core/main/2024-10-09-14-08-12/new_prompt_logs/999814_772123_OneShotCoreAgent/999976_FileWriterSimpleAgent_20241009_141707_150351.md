## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA report, I will make the following changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Update the `get_weakness_factor` method to include the 'Normal' type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
2. Modify the `execute_skill` method to provide feedback on skill effectiveness during battle.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The modifications will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture.

Here's the updated `MainGameScene` class with the proposed solutions:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `get_weakness_factor` method now includes the 'Normal' type, which has a neutral effectiveness (factor of 1) against all other types, including itself.

2. The `execute_skill` method now provides feedback on skill effectiveness during battle. It uses the weakness factor to determine if a skill is "super effective" (factor > 1), "not very effective" (factor < 1), or neutral (factor = 1).

3. The `calculate_damage` function now returns both the final damage and the weakness factor, allowing the `execute_skill` method to provide appropriate feedback.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The `models.py` file remains unchanged, as it already contains pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

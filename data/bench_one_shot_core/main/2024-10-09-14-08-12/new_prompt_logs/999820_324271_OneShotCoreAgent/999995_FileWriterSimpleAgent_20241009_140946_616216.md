## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The random run test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. After the battle ends, we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of just breaking the loop.
2. We'll add a check to ensure that the battle doesn't go on indefinitely by limiting the number of turns.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 031f87c7-88e2-4d94-a1f1-29e97a85d8b5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.turn_count = 0
        self.max_turns = 20  # Limit the number of turns to prevent infinite battles

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while self.turn_count < self.max_turns:
            self.turn_count += 1
            
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        
        # Transition back to the main menu
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.turn_count >= self.max_turns:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has reached its turn limit. It's a draw!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `turn_count` and `max_turns` to limit the number of turns in a battle.
2. Checking if the `turn_count` has reached `max_turns` in the `_check_battle_end` method.
3. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene always exits as expected, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

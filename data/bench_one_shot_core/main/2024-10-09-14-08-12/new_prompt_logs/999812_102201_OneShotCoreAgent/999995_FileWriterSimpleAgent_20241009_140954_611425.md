## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when a player wins or loses.

2. The random test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
2. We'll update the check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll modify the game_loop to break and transition when the battle ends.

Here's the updated MainGameScene implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 185c5698-3a2a-42b9-bf87-e1669f0a6d82
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str(self.player_creature)}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature: Creature) -> str:
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if not self.check_battle_end():
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits and transitions back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. The random test should now pass as the scene will exit as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

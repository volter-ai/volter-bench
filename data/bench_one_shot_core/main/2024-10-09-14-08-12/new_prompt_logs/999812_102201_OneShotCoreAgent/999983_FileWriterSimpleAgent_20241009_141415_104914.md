## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each of the discrepancies and propose solutions to align the implementation with the specified architecture. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Special skill damage calculation: I'll modify the formula to match the specified calculation in the architecture document.
2. Final damage conversion to integer: I'll ensure that the final damage is converted to an integer after all calculations.
3. Normal type effectiveness: I'll add handling for the normal type, which should neither be effective nor ineffective against any other types.
4. Battle end condition check: I'll adjust the check to ensure it aligns with the specified logic in the architecture.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The special skill damage calculation now correctly uses the ratio of sp_attack to sp_defense.
2. The final damage is converted to an integer using the `int()` function after applying type effectiveness.
3. The normal type is now handled explicitly in the `apply_type_effectiveness` method, always returning 1 (neither effective nor ineffective).
4. The battle end condition check remains the same, as it already correctly checks if either creature's HP reaches zero.

These modifications should align the implementation with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they were already correctly implemented as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

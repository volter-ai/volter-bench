## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these concerns, I'll make the following adjustments to align the implementation more closely with the specified architecture:

1. Modify the damage calculation to ensure it follows the exact steps described in the architecture.
2. Remove the handling of negative damage values, as this is not specified in the architecture.
3. Remove the display of messages during battle, as these are not explicitly mentioned in the architecture.
4. Remove the transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, as this is not specified in the architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 0f19f818-5276-43af-83fc-5d7a577fb51e
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Player's turn:
> {self.player_creature.skills[0].display_name}
> {self.player_creature.skills[1].display_name}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = self.calculate_raw_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        weakness_resistance_factor = self.calculate_weakness_resistance_factor(skill, defender)
        final_damage = int(weakness_resistance_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp -= final_damage

    def calculate_raw_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            return attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            return (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def calculate_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill, defender):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2, ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2, ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2, ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation now follows the exact steps described in the architecture, including the separate calculation of raw damage and the application of the weakness-resistance factor.
2. Negative damage values are no longer handled explicitly, as this was not specified in the architecture.
3. Display messages during battle have been removed, as they were not explicitly mentioned in the architecture.
4. The transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends has been removed, as it was not specified in the architecture.

These modifications align the implementation more closely with the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they were already correctly implemented as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to offer swap choices when there are no available creatures to swap to. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to before offering choices.
2. If there are no available creatures, we'll return a "no-op" action instead of trying to offer empty choices.
3. We'll add a new method `get_available_creatures` to centralize the logic for finding available creatures.

This approach maintains the current architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

                return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Adding a `get_available_creatures` method to centralize the logic for finding available creatures to swap.
2. Modifying the `choose_swap` method to check if there are available creatures before offering choices.
3. Introducing a "no_op" action type for cases where a player can't take any action.
4. Updating the `resolve_turn` method to handle the new "no_op" action type.

These changes should prevent the `_wait_for_choice` method from being called with an empty list of choices, resolving the AssertionError we were seeing in the tests. The game will now gracefully handle situations where a player has no creatures available to swap, allowing the battle to continue without crashing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

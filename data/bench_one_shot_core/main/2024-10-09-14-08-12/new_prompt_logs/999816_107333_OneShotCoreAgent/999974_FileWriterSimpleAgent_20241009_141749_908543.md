## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class to properly end the game when a player wins. The error occurs because the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to return the winner instead of a boolean.
2. In the `run` method, we'll check for a winner after each turn and call `_quit_whole_game` if there is one.
3. We'll also add a `_show_text` call to display the winner before quitting the game.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},

                return self.bot if player == self.player else self.player
        return None
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Modifying the `check_battle_end` method to return the winner (or None if the battle is not over) instead of a boolean.
2. Updating the `run` method to check for a winner after each turn and call `_quit_whole_game` if there is one.
3. Adding a `_show_text` call to display the winner before quitting the game.

These changes ensure that the game ends properly when a player wins, resolving the FixableException we were seeing in the tests. The game will now gracefully end when a player wins, calling `_quit_whole_game` to signal that the game has ended.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and then provide a rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file that incorporates these fixes while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the architecture.

Here's how I'll fix the issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in choice phases for both attack and swap choices.
2. Implement a queue system for actions, storing both players' actions before resolving them.
3. Resolve equal speed randomly by using Python's random module.
4. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.
5. Explicitly handle the normal type as neutral against all types in the type effectiveness calculation.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class without modifying the models, keeping them as pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

This rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file addresses all the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. Added 'Back' options in both `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods.
2. Implemented a queue system for actions in the `run` method and `resolve_turn` method.
3. Resolved equal speed randomly by adding `random.random()` to the sorting key in `resolve_turn`.
4. Implemented forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero in the `check_and_force_swap` method.
5. Explicitly handled the normal type as neutral against all types in the `get_type_factor` method.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the `MainGameScene` class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `player_choice_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. The error occurs because we're trying to access the `thing` attribute of a `Button` object, which doesn't exist. This happens when the player chooses the "Back" option, which is a `Button`, not a `SelectThing`.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a check to see if the chosen skill is an instance of `SelectThing` before accessing the `thing` attribute.
2. If it's not a `SelectThing` (i.e., it's the "Back" button), we'll continue the loop to allow the player to choose again.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed fix:

# Excerpt ID: 724d72cb-a78e-4a01-a2ea-05994e606557

                opponent.active_creature.hp = max(0, opponent.active_creature.hp - damage)

        elif all(c.hp == 0 for c in self.bot.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This modification should resolve the AttributeError by ensuring that we only access the `thing` attribute when we have a `SelectThing` object. The "Back" button will now correctly loop back to the main choice, allowing the player to choose again.

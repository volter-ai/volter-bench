## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue and will address it by improving the MainGameScene implementation. Here's how I plan to fix it:

1. Implement a full resolution phase that includes skill execution and type relationship logic.
2. Mirror the bot's choice phase to be identical to the player's choice phase.
3. Add type effectiveness calculations based on the skill and creature types.
4. Implement the damage calculation formulas for both physical and special skills.
5. Add forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.

I'll rewrite the main_game_scene.py file to include these improvements:

            return True
        return False
```

This implementation addresses the issues raised:

1. The resolution phase now includes skill execution and type relationship logic.
2. The bot's choice phase (bot_turn method) now uses the same get_player_action method as the player, mirroring the player's choice phase.
3. Type effectiveness calculations are implemented in the get_type_effectiveness method.
4. Damage calculation formulas for both physical and special skills are implemented in the calculate_damage method.
5. Forced swapping is implemented when a creature's HP reaches zero in the force_swap method.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine by using the provided methods like _wait_for_choice and _show_text. It also maintains the separation of concerns, keeping all game logic within the scene and not adding any methods to the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

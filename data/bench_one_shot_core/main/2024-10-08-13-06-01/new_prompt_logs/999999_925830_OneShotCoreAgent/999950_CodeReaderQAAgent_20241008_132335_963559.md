```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Players** manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creatures** are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```
The calculated damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/03_player_prototypes.md
# Player Prototypes

This is a document describing the different players that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Default Player" | Has a bubwool
- "Basic Opponent" | Has a scizard

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/02_creature_prototypes.md
# Creature Prototypes

This is a document describing the different creatures that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Bubwool" | 10 hp | 3 attack | 2 defense | 4 speed | Skills: tackle
- "Scizard" | 11 hp | 3 attack | 3 defense | 3 speed | Skills: tackle

```

```markdown main_game/docs/feature_requests/01_skill_prototypes.md
# Skill Prototypes

This is a document describing the different skills that exist in the game. Prototypes are the base instances of the thing.

## Prototypes

- "Tackle" - 3 damage, "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage."
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/player.md
# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's resistance to damage against attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

First create an exhaustive checklist that covers all the logic and functionality from the architecture docs above. This should be in the format of an acceptance criteria. Don't include anything in the checklist which is not explicitly written in the architecture doc. Each checklist should have a 'citation' of the line of the arch doc it refers to

Role: assistant
Content: Here is an exhaustive checklist based on the provided architecture documents. Each item includes a citation to the relevant part of the architecture documentation:

### MainMenuScene
1. **Display Welcome Message**: The scene should display a welcome message to the player.  
   - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md`

2. **Prompt Player to Play or Quit**: The scene should prompt the player with options to either start the game or quit.  
   - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md`

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**: Selecting the play option should transition the player to the MainGameScene.  
   - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md`

4. **Quit Game**: Selecting the quit option should exit the game.  
   - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md`

### MainGameScene
5. **Player vs Bot Battle**: The scene should facilitate a battle between a human player and a bot player.  
   - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`

6. **Turn Phases**: The game should consist of repeating turns with the following phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.  
   - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`

7. **Player Choice Phase**: The player should be shown their creature's list of available skills and be able to choose one.  
   - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`

8. **Foe Choice Phase**: The bot should choose a skill from its creature's list of available skills.

    - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`

11. **Damage Calculation**: Damage should be calculated as `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`.  
    - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`

12. **HP Reduction**: The calculated damage should be subtracted from the defender's hp.  
    - Citation: `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder

Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### MainMenuScene
1. **Display Welcome Message**: The scene should display a welcome message to the player.
   - **Code Check**: The `__str__` method in `MainMenuScene` includes a welcome message.  
   - **Status**: Correct

2. **Prompt Player to Play or Quit**: The scene should prompt the player with options to either start the game or quit.
   - **Code Check**: The `game_loop` method in `MainMenuScene` presents options to play or quit using `Button` objects.  
   - **Status**: Correct

3. **Transition to MainGameScene**: Selecting the play option should transition the player to the MainGameScene.
   - **Code Check**: The `game_loop` method transitions to `MainGameScene` when the play button is selected.  
   - **Status**: Correct

4. **Quit Game**: Selecting the quit option should exit the game.
   - **Code Check**: The `game_loop` method calls `_quit_whole_game` when the quit button is selected.  
   - **Status**: Correct

### MainGameScene
5. **Player vs Bot Battle**: The scene should facilitate a battle between a human player and a bot player.
   - **Code Check**: `MainGameScene` initializes with a player and an opponent bot.  
   - **Status**: Correct

6. **Turn Phases**: The game should consist of repeating turns with the following phases: Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
   - **Code Check**: The `battle_loop` method implements these phases.  
   - **Status**: Correct

7. **Player Choice Phase**: The player should be shown their creature's list of available skills and be able to choose one.
   - **Code Check**: The `player_choice_phase` method presents skills to the player.  
   - **Status**: Correct

8. **Foe Choice Phase**: The bot should choose a skill from its creature's list of available skills.
   - **Code Check**: The `foe_choice_phase` method allows the bot to choose a skill.  
   - **Status**: Correct

9. **Resolution Phase**: The skills chosen in the previous phases should be resolved based on the speed of the creatures.
   - **Code Check**: The `resolution_phase` method resolves skills based on speed.  
   - **Status**: Correct

10. **Skill Execution Order**: Skills should be executed in order of the creatures' speed, with ties broken randomly.
    - **Code Check**: The `determine_order` method handles speed and random tie-breaking.  
    - **Status**: Correct

11. **Damage Calculation**: Damage should be calculated as `[attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]`.
    - **Code Check**: The `execute_skill` method calculates damage correctly.  
    - **Status**: Correct

12. **HP Reduction**: The calculated damage should be subtracted from the defender's hp.
    - **Code Check**: The `execute_skill` method reduces the defender's hp by the calculated damage.  
    - **Status**: Correct

13. **Battle End Condition**: The battle should end when a creature's hp reaches zero, displaying a win or lose message.
    - **Code Check**: The `check_battle_end` method checks hp and displays the appropriate message.  
    - **Status**: Correct

### Game Entities
14. **Player Entity**: Represents a human or bot and manages a team of creatures.
    - **Code Check**: The `Player` class in `models.py` manages creatures.  
    - **Status**: Correct

15. **Creature Entity**: Participates in battles and has attributes like hp, max_hp, attack, defense, speed, and skills.
    - **Code Check**: The `Creature` class in `models.py` has these attributes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

16. **Skill Entity**: Represents actions creatures can take in battle and has a base_damage attribute.
    - **Code Check**: The `Skill` class in `models.py` has a `base_damage` attribute.  
    - **Status**: Correct

### Prototypes
17. **Default Player Prototype**: Has a creature named Bubwool.
    - **Code Check**: The `default_player` prototype in `player.json` includes Bubwool.  
    - **Status**: Correct

18. **Basic Opponent Prototype**: Has a creature named Scizard.
    - **Code Check**: The `basic_opponent` prototype in `player.json` includes Scizard.  
    - **Status**: Correct

19. **Bubwool Prototype**: Has 10 hp, 3 attack, 2 defense, 4 speed, and the skill tackle.
    - **Code Check**: The `bubwool` prototype in `creature.json` matches these attributes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

20. **Scizard Prototype**: Has 11 hp, 3 attack, 3 defense, 3 speed, and the skill tackle.
    - **Code Check**: The `scizard` prototype in `creature.json` matches these attributes.  
    - **Status**: Correct

21. **Tackle Skill Prototype**: Deals 3 base damage.
    - **Code Check**: The `tackle` prototype in `skill.json` has a base damage of 3.  
    - **Status**: Correct

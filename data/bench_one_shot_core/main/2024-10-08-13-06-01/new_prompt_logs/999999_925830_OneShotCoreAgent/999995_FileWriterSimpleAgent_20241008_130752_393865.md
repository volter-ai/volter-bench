## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which is required by the engine. We'll address this by adding a transition back to the main menu after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when either the player or the foe's creature's HP reaches 0), we'll add a prompt asking the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the main menu or quit the whole game.
3. We'll move the `_reset_creatures` method call to the beginning of the `run` method to ensure creatures are reset before each battle.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3a926de1-aa16-4b32-993b-0cdbb58c2fed
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._reset_creatures()
        while True:
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._post_battle_menu()
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Foe used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Foe dealt {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp

    def _post_battle_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if play_again_button == choice:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` addresses the issues by:

1. Resetting the creatures' HP at the beginning of each battle.
2. Adding a post-battle menu that allows the player to choose between playing again or quitting.
3. Using `_transition_to_scene` to return to the main menu or `_quit_whole_game` to end the game, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.

These changes should resolve the test failures and make the game flow more robust and consistent with the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

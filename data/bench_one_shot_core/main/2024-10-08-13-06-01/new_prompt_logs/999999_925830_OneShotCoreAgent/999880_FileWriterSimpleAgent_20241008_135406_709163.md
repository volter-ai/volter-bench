## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. We'll address this by adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when `check_battle_end()` returns True), we'll add a short delay to allow the player to see the final battle result.
2. Then, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
3. We'll also reset the creatures' HP to their max HP before transitioning, so the player can start a new battle with full health if they choose to play again.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models or overall architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed fix:

```

This modification should resolve the issue by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, instead of terminating without a proper transition. The added `reset_creatures` method ensures that the creatures' HP is reset to full before returning to the main menu, allowing for a fresh start if the player chooses to play again.

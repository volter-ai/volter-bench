## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`, which is required by the engine. We'll address this by adding a transition back to the main menu after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, we'll return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
2. In the `game_loop` method, we'll break the loop when the battle ends.
3. After the game loop, we'll transition back to the main menu.

This approach maintains the current architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. It also ensures that the scene always exits properly, fixing both the test failures.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9ba1922f-265c-4fa9-92b8-5676e7f33163
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Foe's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.foe_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")  # Return to main menu after battle

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Foe used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.foe, f"Foe dealt {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.foe, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This solution should resolve the test failures by ensuring that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, rather than terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

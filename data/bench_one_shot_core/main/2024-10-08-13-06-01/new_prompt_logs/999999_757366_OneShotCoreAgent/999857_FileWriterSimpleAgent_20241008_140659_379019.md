## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the AttributeError where the 'Skill' object has no attribute 'speed'. This error occurs in the resolution_phase method of the MainGameScene class. The problem is that we're trying to sort actions based on the speed of the skill, but skills don't have a speed attribute. Instead, we should be using the speed of the creature using the skill.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class to use the speed of the creature instead of the skill.
2. We'll add a helper method get_creature_for_action to determine which creature is performing the action.
3. We'll update the sorting key to use the creature's speed for attack actions.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 64a4e52e-8e86-4745-a35f-33162edff48d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def run(self):

    def choose_swap(self, current_player):
        available_creatures = [creature for creature in current_player.creatures if creature != current_player.active_creature and creature.hp > 0]
        creature_choices = [SelectThing(creature) for creature in available_creatures]

        for action in actions:

                self.perform_swap(self.player if action == player_action else self.bot, action[1])

        for action in sorted(actions, key=lambda x: self.get_creature_for_action(x).speed if x[0] == "attack" else 0, reverse=True):

    def perform_attack(self, attacker, skill):
        defender = self.bot if attacker == self.player else self.player
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker.active_creature, defender.active_creature, skill)

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.player.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.bot.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError by using the creature's speed instead of trying to access a non-existent speed attribute on the Skill object. The resolution_phase method now correctly sorts actions based on the speed of the creature performing the action, which aligns with the game's design and the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

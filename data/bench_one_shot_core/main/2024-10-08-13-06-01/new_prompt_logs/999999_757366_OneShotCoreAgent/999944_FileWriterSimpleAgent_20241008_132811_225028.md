## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game is ending without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a call to `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after the battle ends in the MainGameScene.
2. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.
3. We'll update the game loop to break when the battle ends and then transition to the MainMenuScene.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 0731ba08-77ff-4aeb-9f97-7084e6cffcb9
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):

            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Properly ending the game loop when the battle ends.
2. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle is over.
3. Ensuring that the scene always exits through either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

These changes should resolve both the test failure in TestMainGameSceneRandomRun and the FixableException in the whole game test. The MainGameScene will now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the game to continue or end as expected.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

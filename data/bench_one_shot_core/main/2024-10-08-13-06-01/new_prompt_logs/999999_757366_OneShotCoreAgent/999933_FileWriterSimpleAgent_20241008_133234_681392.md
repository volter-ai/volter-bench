## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The whole game flow is not completing correctly, likely due to the same issue in the MainGameScene.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses. This approach will ensure that the scene exits properly and allows the game to continue or end as expected.

Here's how we'll fix the MainGameScene:

1. We'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene after displaying the battle result.
2. We'll remove the return statement that was causing the scene to exit improperly.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will allow the game to continue running or exit gracefully, depending on the player's choices in the main menu.

The modifications maintain the existing architecture and model structure while addressing the specific problems identified in the test output. By transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, we ensure that the game flow continues as expected and that the scene exits in the manner required by the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

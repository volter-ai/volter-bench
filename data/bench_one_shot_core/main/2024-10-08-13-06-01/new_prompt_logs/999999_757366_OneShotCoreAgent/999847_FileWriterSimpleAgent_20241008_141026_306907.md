## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To fix these problems, we need to modify the MainGameScene to handle forced swapping when a creature is knocked out and ensure that the reset_creatures method is called when leaving the Main Game Scene. Here's how we'll address these issues:

1. We'll add a method to handle forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.
2. We'll modify the resolution_phase to check for knocked-out creatures after each attack and force a swap if necessary.
3. We'll call the reset_creatures method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify any models, as they are already correct pure data schemas.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `force_swap` method that handles forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.
2. Modifying the `resolution_phase` to check for knocked-out creatures after each attack and force a swap if necessary.
3. Calling the `reset_creatures` method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `run` method.

These modifications ensure that the game handles knocked-out creatures correctly and resets the state of all creatures when leaving the Main Game Scene, which should resolve the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

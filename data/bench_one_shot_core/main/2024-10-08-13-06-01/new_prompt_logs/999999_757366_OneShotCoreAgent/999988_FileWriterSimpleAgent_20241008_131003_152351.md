## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the battle_loop method to return when the battle ends, allowing the run method to handle the transition.
3. We'll add a method to display the battle result before transitioning.

These changes will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the engine's architecture.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: e2bf70f4-dce1-432b-9388-a24dfc41fd2b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

> Choose a skill
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"- {skill.display_name}: {skill.description}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        battle_result = self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result(battle_result)
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            bot_skill = self.bot_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                return "lose"
            elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                return "win"

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def bot_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Opponent used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You received {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def display_battle_result(self, result: str):
        if result == "win":
            self._show_text(self.player, "Congratulations! You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle. Better luck next time!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `run` method always transitions to another scene (MainMenuScene) after the battle ends.
2. Modifying the `battle_loop` to return the battle result instead of breaking the loop.
3. Adding a `display_battle_result` method to show the outcome of the battle before transitioning.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, following the engine's architecture and guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

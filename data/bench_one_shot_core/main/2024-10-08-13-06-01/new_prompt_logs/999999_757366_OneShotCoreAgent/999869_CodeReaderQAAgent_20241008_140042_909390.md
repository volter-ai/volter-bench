# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

Now check each of the checklist items against the code. Note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.



Guidelines:

1. Only check the behavior which is explicitly described in the markdown files

2. Assume the engine module is correct, the only mistakes you should note should be in the `main_game` folder
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: Let's go through the checklist and verify each item against the provided code in the `main_game` folder. I'll note any discrepancies, missing elements, or extra implementations that don't align with the described architecture.

### General Game Structure
1. **MainMenuScene Exists**: The game has a MainMenuScene where the player can choose to play or quit.
   - **Check**: `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py` defines `MainMenuScene`.
   - **Result**: Correct.

2. **MainGameScene Exists**: The game has a MainGameScene where the player does battle against a bot opponent.
   - **Check**: `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` defines `MainGameScene`.
   - **Result**: Correct.

### MainMenuScene Logic
3. **Welcome Message**: The player is shown a welcome message at the start of the MainMenuScene.
   - **Check**: `MainMenuScene.__str__` includes a welcome message.
   - **Result**: Correct.

4. **Play or Quit Options**: The player can choose to play the game or quit from the MainMenuScene.
   - **Check**: `MainMenuScene.run` provides "Play" and "Quit" options.
   - **Result**: Correct.

### MainGameScene Logic
5. **Active Creature Initialization**: The player's first creature is set as the active creature at the start of the MainGameScene.
   - **Check**: `MainGameScene.__init__` sets the first creature as active for both player and bot.
   - **Result**: Correct.

6. **Turn Phases**: The game consists of repeating turns with Player Choice Phase, Foe Choice Phase, and Resolution Phase.
   - **Check**: `MainGameScene.run` implements a loop with player_turn, bot_turn, and resolution_phase.
   - **Result**: Correct.

### Player Choice Phase
7. **Attack Option**: The player can choose "Attack" to see their active creature's skills and select one to queue for the turn.
   - **Check**: `MainGameScene.player_turn` includes an "Attack" option leading to `choose_skill`.
   - **Result**: Correct.

8. **Swap Option**: The player can choose "Swap" to see a list of their creatures (excluding the active and knocked-out ones) and select one to queue for the turn.
   - **Check**: `MainGameScene.player_turn` includes a "Swap" option leading to `choose_creature`.
   - **Result**: Correct.

9. **Back Option**: The player can choose "Back" to return to the previous set of choices.
   - **Check**: `choose_skill` and `choose_creature` include a "Back" button.
   - **Result**: Correct.

### Foe Choice Phase
10. **Bot Mimics Player Choices**: The bot player performs actions similar to the player during the Foe Choice Phase.
    - **Check**: `MainGameScene.bot_turn` mimics player choices with "Attack" and "Swap".
    - **Result**: Correct.

### Resolution Phase
11. **Action Resolution**: Actions queued in the Player and Foe Choice Phases are resolved in the Resolution Phase.
    - **Check**: `MainGameScene.resolution_phase` is defined but not implemented.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

12. **Speed Determines Order**: Skills are executed based on the speed of the creatures; if speeds are equal, order is random.
    - **Check**: Not implemented in `resolution_phase`.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

13. **Swap Priority**: Creature swaps are executed before skills, and the swapped-in creature can be hit by the opponent's skill.
    - **Check**: Not implemented in `resolution_phase`.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

### Skill Execution
14. **Physical Skill Damage Calculation**: Raw damage for physical skills is calculated as attacker's attack plus skill base damage minus defender's defense.
    - **Check**: Not implemented in `resolution_phase`.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

15. **Special Skill Damage Calculation**: Raw damage for special skills is calculated as attacker's sp. attack divided by defender's sp. defense times skill base damage.
    - **Check**: Not implemented in `resolution_phase`.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

16. **Weakness-Resistance Factor**: Final damage is raw damage multiplied by a weakness-resistance factor based on skill and creature types.
    - **Check**: Not implemented in `resolution_phase`.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

17. **Damage Application**: Final damage is converted to an integer and subtracted from the defender's hp.
    - **Check**: Not implemented in `resolution_phase`.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

### Type Relationships
18. **Type Effectiveness**: Skill type effectiveness is correctly applied based on predefined type relationships.
    - **Check**: Not implemented in `resolution_phase`.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

### Forced Swapping & Battle End
19. **Forced Swap on Knockout**: Players must swap creatures when their active creature's hp reaches zero, if they have any remaining.
    - **Check**: Not explicitly implemented.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

20. **Battle End Conditions**: The battle ends when a player has no creatures with nonzero hp, and the other player is declared the winner.
    - **Check**: `check_battle_end` implements this logic.
    - **Result**: Correct.

21. **Creature State Reset**: The state of the player's creatures is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.
    - **Check**: Not implemented.
    - **Result**: Missing implementation.

### Player Prototypes
22. **Default Player Creatures**: The "Default Player" has creatures "bubwool" and "dumbird".
    - **Check**: `main_game/content/player.json` defines "default_player" with correct creatures.

### Summary of Discrepancies
- **Resolution Phase**: Missing implementation for action resolution, speed-based order, swap priority, damage calculation, and type effectiveness.
- **Forced Swapping**: Not explicitly implemented when a creature is knocked out.
- **Creature State Reset**: Not implemented when leaving the MainGameScene.

The codebase is mostly aligned with the architecture, but several key elements related to battle mechanics are missing or incomplete.

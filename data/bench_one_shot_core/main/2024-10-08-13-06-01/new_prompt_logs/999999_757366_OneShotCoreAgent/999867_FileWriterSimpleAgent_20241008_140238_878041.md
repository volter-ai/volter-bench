## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will focus on improving the MainGameScene implementation. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Implement the resolution phase, including action resolution, speed-based order, and swap priority.
2. Add damage calculation logic, including type effectiveness.
3. Implement forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.
4. Add creature state reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

I will rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to include these improvements. The models and architecture will remain the same, and I'll stay within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's the updated implementation:

```

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. The resolution phase now includes action resolution, speed-based order, and swap priority.
2. Damage calculation logic has been implemented, including type effectiveness.
3. Forced swapping is now implemented when a creature is knocked out.
4. Creature state reset is performed when leaving the MainGameScene.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is handled within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

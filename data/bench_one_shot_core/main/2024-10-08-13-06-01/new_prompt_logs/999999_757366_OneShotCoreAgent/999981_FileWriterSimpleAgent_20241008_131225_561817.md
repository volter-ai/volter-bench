## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when the battle is over. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the MainMenuScene.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. We don't need to modify any models, as the issue is with the scene flow.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: e7475bd3-869d-4b76-a2f7-a3abd7bda841
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}

Opponent's skills:
{self._format_skills(self.bot_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild bot appeared!")
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Bot Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self._bot_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._end_battle()
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _bot_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot is choosing a skill...")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Bot used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

        self._show_text(self.player, f"You dealt {player_skill.damage} damage!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Bot dealt {bot_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.bot_creature.hp <= 0

    def _end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The scene now properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We've added an `_end_battle` method to handle showing the battle result before transitioning.
3. The `run` method now breaks out of the main loop when the battle ends, and then transitions to the MainMenuScene.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The random test runs should now pass without the previous errors.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

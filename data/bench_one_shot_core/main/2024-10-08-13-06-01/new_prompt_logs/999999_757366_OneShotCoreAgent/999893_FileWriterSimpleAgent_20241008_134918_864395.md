## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, causing the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not properly structured to continue the game or transition to another scene after a battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the game loop and transition to another scene or quit the game after a battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the game state and start a new battle if the player wants to play again.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until the player decides to quit.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Implementing a main loop in the `run` method that starts new battles and asks the player if they want to play again or quit after each battle.
2. Adding a `_start_new_battle` method to reset the game state for each new battle.
3. Ensuring that the game loop in `game_loop` method breaks when a battle ends.
4. Providing an option to quit the game using `_quit_whole_game` when the player chooses to stop playing.

These modifications should resolve the test failures by properly exiting the scene and either transitioning to a new battle or quitting the game as expected. The structure now allows for multiple battles and gives the player control over when to end the game session.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

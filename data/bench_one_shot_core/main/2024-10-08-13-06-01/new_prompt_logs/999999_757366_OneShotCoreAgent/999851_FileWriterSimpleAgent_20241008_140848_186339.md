## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The battle is ending without properly transitioning or quitting the game.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the check_battle_end method not only checks for the end condition but also handles the transition or game quit.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify any models, as they are already correct pure data schemas.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp})
{self.bot.display_name}: {self.bot.active_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.bot.active_creature.hp}/{self.bot.active_creature.max_hp})

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},

    def check_battle_end(self):

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends in the `run` method.
2. Keeping the `check_battle_end` method as a boolean check, which allows the `run` method to control the flow of the game.
3. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to reset the state of all creatures after the battle, which can be called before transitioning back to the main menu.

These modifications ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which should resolve the test failures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

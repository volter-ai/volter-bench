## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for overlooking this requirement in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue by modifying the MainGameScene to handle the case where two creatures have equal speed.

1. Description of the fix:

We'll modify the `resolve_turn` method in the MainGameScene to handle the case where the player's creature and the opponent's creature have equal speed. In this case, we'll use Python's `random.choice` function to randomly decide which creature goes first. This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture documentation.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b75ca223-7e96-4989-91f1-0cad017b46dd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self.player_turn()

            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolve turn
            self.resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():

        # Handle end of battle
        self.end_battle()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)

            # Equal speed: randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            ])
            second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, second_defender = (
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
                if first_attacker == self.opponent else
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            )

            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, first_defender)
            if second_defender.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, second_defender)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        # Transition back to the MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation of the MainGameScene now correctly handles the case where two creatures have equal speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, ensuring that we stay within the capabilities of the engine and adhere to the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of not handling the case where two creatures have the same speed in the resolution phase.

1. Proposed solution:

To fix this issue, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and implement a random decision for turn order when speeds are equal. This aligns with the architecture documentation requirement.

Here's how we'll implement the fix:
- Compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
- If the speeds are equal, use Python's `random.choice()` to randomly decide which creature goes first.
- Implement the skill execution based on this decision.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models.

2. Rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

        return False
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where two creatures have the same speed in the resolution phase. When the speeds are equal, it randomly decides which creature goes first, satisfying the requirement from the architecture documentation. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing functionality while addressing the specific issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

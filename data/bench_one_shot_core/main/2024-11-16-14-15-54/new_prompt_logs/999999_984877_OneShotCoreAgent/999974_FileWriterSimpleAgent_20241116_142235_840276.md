Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's architecture, this exception is expected and should be caught, as indicated by the error message.

Looking at the other passing tests in the codebase, we need to catch both `RandomModeGracefulExit` and `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame` in our test, since either can occur during random testing - the first when we run out of random moves, the second when the game naturally ends.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 87941196-49e6-4f45-acc5-5076ab3a569d
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for this complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully for run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added success message for both types of expected completion

This fix:
- Stays within the engine's architecture
- Properly handles both ways a game can end during random testing
- Maintains the test's purpose of verifying the scene runs without errors
- Doesn't require any changes to the game logic or models

The test will now pass since it properly handles the graceful exit when a player wins the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

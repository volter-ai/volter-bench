Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that MainGameScene returns directly after a win instead of properly ending the game with `_quit_whole_game()`. According to the engine's architecture, scenes must always transition to another scene or quit the game - they can't just return.

The fix is simple: when a player wins, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` instead of returning. This follows the engine's scene transition patterns and properly signals the end of the game.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                    if opponent.active_creature.hp <= 0:
                        opponent.active_creature.hp = 0

                            self.reset_creatures()
                            self._quit_whole_game()  # Changed from return to _quit_whole_game()
```

The key change is replacing the `return` statement with `self._quit_whole_game()` when a player wins. This properly signals to the engine that the game is ending rather than just returning from the scene.

This follows the engine's architecture where scenes must explicitly transition or quit, and fixes the test failure while maintaining all the game's functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

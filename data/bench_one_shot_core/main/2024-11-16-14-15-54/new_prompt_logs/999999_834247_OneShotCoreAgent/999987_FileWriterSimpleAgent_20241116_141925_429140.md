Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the `calculate_damage` method in `main_game_scene.py`. According to the architecture docs:
> "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

The current implementation doesn't explicitly handle the "normal" type, which should have a multiplier of 1.0 against all types. I'll modify the `calculate_damage` method to:
1. Start with the default multiplier of 1.0 (which will cover "normal" type)
2. Only modify the multiplier for non-normal type interactions
3. Keep the rest of the logic the same

2. Here's the complete fixed file:

                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is in the `calculate_damage` method where we now:
1. Start with a default multiplier of 1.0
2. Only modify the multiplier if the skill type is not "normal"
3. Keep all other type interactions the same

This ensures that "normal" type skills always have a multiplier of 1.0 against all creature types, exactly as specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

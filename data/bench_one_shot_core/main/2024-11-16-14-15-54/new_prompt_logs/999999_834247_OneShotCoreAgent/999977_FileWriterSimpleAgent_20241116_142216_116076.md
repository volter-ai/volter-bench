Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene isn't properly ending - when the battle ends, it needs to either transition to another scene or quit the game. Looking at the architecture:

1. The MainGameScene should call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends since this is the final scene
2. This matches the engine's requirements that scenes must explicitly transition or quit
3. The fix needs to be in the MainGameScene class

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. This ensures the scene properly terminates according to the engine's requirements rather than just breaking from the loop.

This maintains all the architectural requirements while fixing the test failure by properly ending the game when the battle is over.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. We need to make active_creature optional since it's initialized after player creation.

In Python, we can make a field optional by using Optional[Type] from typing. This tells the type system that the field can be None.

I'll modify the Player model in models.py to make active_creature optional:

# Excerpt ID: d5fdc65f-51d8-4e2e-adbd-773bfe2fe7e9
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

The key change is:
1. Added `Optional` import from typing
2. Changed `active_creature: Creature` to `active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None`

This maintains the pure data schema requirement while allowing the active_creature to be initialized as None and set later when the game starts. This matches the architecture where the active_creature is set in the MainGameScene when the battle begins.

The change follows all guidelines:
- Still inherits from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
- Remains a pure data schema
- Uses proper typing
- Maintains direct model references
- Doesn't add methods or properties

This should resolve the validation errors in the tests since the Player model will no longer require active_creature to be present during initialization.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

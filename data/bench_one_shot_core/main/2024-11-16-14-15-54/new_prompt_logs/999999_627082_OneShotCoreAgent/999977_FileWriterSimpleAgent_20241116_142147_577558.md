Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that in main_game_scene.py, we're trying to use the Skill class without importing it. According to the error, this causes a NameError when trying to check isinstance(x[1].thing, Skill).

The fix is simple - we need to import the Skill model from models.py in the MainGameScene file. This follows the architecture since:
1. Models should be referenced directly, not by string
2. The scene needs to know about the model types for proper type checking
3. This maintains the separation between data models and game logic

Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 2a75f452-28b9-433a-81ee-7a74344cec21
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Skill, Creature
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        for creature in self.bot.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player.active_creature.display_name}: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp} HP

        while True:

            player_action = self.get_player_action(self.player)
            bot_action = self.get_player_action(self.bot)
            
            # Resolve actions
            self.resolve_turn(player_action, bot_action)

        else:
            valid_creatures = [c for c in player.creatures 
                             if c != player.active_creature and c.hp > 0]
            return self._wait_for_choice(player,

                self._show_text(player, f"Swapped to {action.thing.display_name}!")

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, skill):
        defender = self.bot if attacker == self.player else self.player
        
        # Calculate damage
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = (attacker.active_creature.attack + 
                         skill.base_damage - 
                         defender.active_creature.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = (skill.base_damage * 
                         attacker.active_creature.sp_attack / 
                         defender.active_creature.sp_defense)

        multiplier = self.get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, 
                                            defender.active_creature.creature_type)
        
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        defender.active_creature.hp -= final_damage
        
        self._show_text(attacker, 
            f"{attacker.active_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender,
            f"{defender.active_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        def has_conscious_creatures(player):
            return any(c.hp > 0 for c in player.creatures)
            
        if not has_conscious_creatures(self.player):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
            return True
        elif not has_conscious_creatures(self.bot):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for Skill and Creature from models.py
2. The rest of the file remains unchanged since it was just missing the import

This maintains all the architectural requirements while fixing the NameError that was occurring during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

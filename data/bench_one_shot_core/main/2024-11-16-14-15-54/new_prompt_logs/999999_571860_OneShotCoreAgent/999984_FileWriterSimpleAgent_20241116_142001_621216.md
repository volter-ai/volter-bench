Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
Looking at the architecture docs, specifically `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`, there are two issues:

a) The damage calculation formula should be:
# Excerpt ID: eadfd7f7-fa31-4d4c-a8a3-40b21fbf0cf5
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

b) The type relationships should include Leaf type:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

I'll fix this by:
1. Adding "Leaf" type to the type effectiveness system
2. Implementing the exact damage formula from the docs
3. Making sure all type relationships are symmetric

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 95462db8-66f7-4b5c-bd20-94329d07baa8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        # Normal type has no strengths or weaknesses
        if skill_type == "normal":

        # Type effectiveness matrix
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {
                "leaf": 2.0,    # Fire strong vs Leaf

                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._quit_whole_game()
```

Key changes:
1. Implemented proper type effectiveness system including Leaf type
2. Separated type multiplier logic into its own method for clarity
3. Implemented exact damage formula from architecture docs
4. Added effectiveness messages to show when moves are super effective or not very effective
5. Ensured damage can't go negative
6. Made type relationships symmetric and complete according to docs

The implementation now exactly matches the architecture specifications while maintaining the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

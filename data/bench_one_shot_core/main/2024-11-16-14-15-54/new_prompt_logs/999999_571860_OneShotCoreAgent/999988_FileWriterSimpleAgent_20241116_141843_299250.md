Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine architecture, this is an expected exception that should be caught, similar to how we handle RandomModeGracefulExit.

The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (for when random moves reach their limit) AND _QuitWholeGame (for when the game naturally ends through win/loss). Both are valid ways for a test run to end.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: a4167ebd-f609-4e40-8148-2eba6532e2e0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed naturally through win/loss, ending run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added descriptive print statement to show how the game ended

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling both ways a game can end:
- Through RandomModeGracefulExit when random moves are exhausted
- Through _QuitWholeGame when a player wins or loses

The MainGameScene's behavior of calling _quit_whole_game() on win/loss is correct - we just needed to handle that exception in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene._resolve_turn() when trying to call _execute_skill(). The error shows we're passing 6 arguments when the method expects 5.

Looking at the code:
# Excerpt ID: f8036a53-bf6d-45f0-86c8-fe93d536c725
```python
first = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_choice)
second = (self.bot, self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice)
self._execute_skill(*first, *second[1:])
```

When we unpack these tuples, we're passing:
- *first: (player, player_creature, player_choice)
- *second[1:]: (bot_creature, bot_choice)
Total: 5 arguments + self = 6 arguments

The fix:
We need to restructure how we pass the arguments to _execute_skill(). The method should only need:
- attacker_creature
- skill
- defender_creature

We don't need the player objects since we already have them as class members. I'll modify the MainGameScene to fix this issue.

2. Here's the fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: abedfb60-415a-4b36-b125-ff52aa9e9fc8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, DictionaryChoice
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.bot_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Battle Start!")

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot Choice Phase
            self.bot_choice = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
            elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = []
        for skill in creature.skills:
            choice = DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name)
            choice.value = {"skill": skill}
            choices.append(choice)
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).value["skill"]

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        # Determine order based on speed
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.bot_creature.speed:
            first = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)
            second = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
        elif self.bot_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
            second = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)
                second = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
            else:
                first = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
                second = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)

        # Execute skills in order
        self._execute_skill(*first)
        if second[2].hp > 0:  # Only execute second skill if target still alive
            self._execute_skill(*second)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        message = f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!"
        if attacker_creature == self.player_creature:
            self._show_text(self.player, message)
        else:
            self._show_text(self.bot, message)
```

The key changes:
1. Simplified _execute_skill to take only 3 parameters: attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature
2. Modified _resolve_turn to pass only the creature and skill data, not the player objects
3. Updated the message display logic in _execute_skill to determine which player to show the message to based on the attacker_creature
4. Fixed the tuple unpacking to match the new parameter structure

This maintains the architecture and capabilities of the engine while fixing the argument count mismatch.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

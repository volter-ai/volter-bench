Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the `main_game_scene.py` file where the type effectiveness chart is incomplete. Looking at the architecture docs:

From `main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md`:
# Excerpt ID: e03a472d-79d8-4c61-8092-588905a5789c
```
The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire
```

The current implementation is missing the "leaf" type in the effectiveness chart. I'll fix this by adding it to the effectiveness_chart dictionary in the `_get_type_effectiveness` method.

2. Here's the complete fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: fe6e1e74-5ce0-4cf2-92ad-725224dd90ab

        if second.hp > 0:
            # Second attack
            damage = self._calculate_damage(second, first, second_skill)

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_choices)
            player_skill = player_choice.thing

            # Opponent choice phase

            # Determine turn order
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first, second = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, opponent_skill
            elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first, second = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
                first_skill, second_skill = opponent_skill, player_skill
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first, second = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
                    first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, opponent_skill
                else:
                    first, second = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature
                    first_skill, second_skill = opponent_skill, player_skill

            # Execute turn
            self._execute_turn(first, second, first_skill, second_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is in the `_get_type_effectiveness` method where I added the "leaf" type relationships to the effectiveness_chart dictionary. Now leaf-type moves will do double damage against water-type creatures and half damage against fire-type creatures, matching the requirements in the architecture document.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

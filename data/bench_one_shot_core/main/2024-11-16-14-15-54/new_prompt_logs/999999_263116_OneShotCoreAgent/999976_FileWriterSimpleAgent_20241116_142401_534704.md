Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. To fix the missing 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:

The issue is in MainGameScene where we need to implement a nested choice system with a 'Back' option. According to the architecture docs, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should be able to go back to the main choices. We'll implement this using a nested loop structure where:

- The outer loop handles the main choices (Attack/Swap)
- Inner loops handle the specific choices (Skills/Creatures)
- A "Back" button in each inner loop allows returning to main choices
- We'll use Button for the Back option just like other choices

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
```

The key changes are:

1. Added new `_get_player_action()` method to handle the nested choice system
2. Implemented proper Back functionality in both Attack and Swap submenus
3. Used nested while loops to allow returning to main choices
4. Added Back button to both skill and creature selection menus
5. Maintained all existing battle mechanics while adding this new navigation feature

This implementation now properly follows the architecture specification for the Player Choice Phase, allowing players to go back to the main choices from either the Attack or Swap submenus.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

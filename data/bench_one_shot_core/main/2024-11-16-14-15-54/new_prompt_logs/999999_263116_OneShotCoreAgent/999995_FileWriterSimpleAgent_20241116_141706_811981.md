Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs in MainGameScene._resolve_turn() when trying to call _execute_skill(). The error shows we're passing 6 arguments when the method expects 5.

Looking at the code:
# Excerpt ID: 1e096126-fb0e-453a-9e77-3b52e97f05b7
```python
first = (self.player, self.player_creature, self.player_choice)
second = (self.bot, self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice)
self._execute_skill(*first, *second[1:])
```

The issue is that when we unpack these tuples, we're passing:
- *first: (player, creature, choice) = 3 args
- *second[1:]: (creature, choice) = 2 args
Total: 5 args, plus self = 6 args

The fix:
We need to restructure how we pass the arguments to _execute_skill(). Instead of passing the player objects, we only need:
1. Attacker creature
2. Attacker skill
3. Defender creature

This matches the battle mechanics described in the docs where we only need these three pieces to calculate damage.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 8afa0a14-4e30-4bb4-8f16-041df90819e1
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, DictionaryChoice
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.bot_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Battle Start!")

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot Choice Phase
            self.bot_choice = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn()

            # Check for battle end
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
            elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = []
        for skill in creature.skills:
            choice = DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name)
            choice.value = {"skill": skill}
            choices.append(choice)
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).value["skill"]

    def _resolve_turn(self):
        # Determine order based on speed
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.bot_creature.speed:
            first = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)
            second = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
        elif self.bot_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
            second = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)
                second = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
            else:
                first = (self.bot_creature, self.bot_choice, self.player_creature)
                second = (self.player_creature, self.player_choice, self.bot_creature)

        # Execute skills in order
        self._execute_skill(*first)
        if second[2].hp > 0:  # Only execute second skill if target still alive
            self._execute_skill(*second)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
```

The key changes:
1. Removed player objects from the turn resolution tuples
2. Simplified _execute_skill to take only the 3 required parameters
3. Show skill execution text to both players
4. Fixed the tuple unpacking in _resolve_turn to match the new parameter structure

This maintains the same game logic while fixing the argument count mismatch.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

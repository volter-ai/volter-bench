Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the MainGameScene's execute_turn logic where it doesn't handle equal speeds correctly. According to the requirements:
"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The fix needs to be in main_game_scene.py, specifically in the execute_turn method. We'll modify the speed comparison to include a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal. This doesn't require any model changes since it's purely game logic.

2. Here's the fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: 20756c2e-7fa1-4cce-ba71-d9b6697a4790
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def calculate_damage(self, skill, attacker, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

            first = self.opponent_creature
            second = self.player_creature
            first_skill = opponent_skill
            second_skill = player_skill
        else:
            # Equal speeds - random order
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first = self.player_creature
                second = self.opponent_creature
                first_skill = player_skill

        # Execute skills in order
        if first == self.player_creature:
            self.opponent_creature.hp -= self.calculate_damage(first_skill, self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.player_creature.hp -= self.calculate_damage(second_skill, self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.player_creature.hp -= self.calculate_damage(first_skill, self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.opponent_creature.hp -= self.calculate_damage(second_skill, self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
            player_skill = player_choice.thing

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills])
            opponent_skill = opponent_choice.thing

            # Resolution phase
            self.execute_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are in the execute_turn method where I've added explicit handling of the equal speeds case using random.random() to give each creature a 50% chance of going first. This maintains the pure game logic in the scene while fulfilling the requirement for random resolution of speed ties.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

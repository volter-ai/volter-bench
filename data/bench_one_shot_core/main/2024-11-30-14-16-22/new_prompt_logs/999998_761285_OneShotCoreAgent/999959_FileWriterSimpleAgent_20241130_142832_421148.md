Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is simple - we're missing the uuid import in main.py. The error occurs in the create_bot method when trying to generate a UUID. We just need to add the import statement at the top of main.py.

2. Here's the complete fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: b07ba7d5-6380-49a2-8049-cb6c7b0429a1
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

This fix:
1. Adds the missing uuid import at the top
2. Maintains all the existing functionality
3. Follows the architecture guidelines since this change is just adding a missing import
4. Doesn't affect any models or their data schema nature
5. Keeps the file's original structure and purpose intact

The error should now be resolved while staying within the engine's capabilities and maintaining the architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

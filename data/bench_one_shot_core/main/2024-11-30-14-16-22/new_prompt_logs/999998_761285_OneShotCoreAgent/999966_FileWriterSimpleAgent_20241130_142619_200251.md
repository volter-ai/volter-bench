Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene's run() method is returning early in some cases. Specifically, in get_player_action() when there are no available creatures, it returns None which causes the run() method to return without a proper transition.

The fix needs to:
- Never return early from run()
- Handle the case where a player has no available creatures by properly ending the battle
- Always transition to MainMenuScene or quit_whole_game when the battle ends
- Remove the early returns and handle all cases within the main game loop

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Moved battle end check to start of main loop
2. Removed early returns from run()
3. Simplified creature fainting logic by handling it in get_player_action()
4. Always ensure proper scene transition when battle ends
5. Removed redundant handle_faint method and integrated its logic into get_player_action
6. Added proper messages when players run out of creatures

These changes ensure the scene always ends with a proper transition while maintaining all the game mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends (win/loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning back to MainMenuScene or calling quit_whole_game.

The fix is simple: In MainGameScene, when check_battle_end() returns true (meaning someone won/lost), we should:
1. Show the win/loss message
2. Reset creature HP to max_hp (as specified in docs)
3. Call _transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene") to return to menu

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. In check_battle_end(), we now return to menu instead of exiting
2. Added HP reset before transitioning
3. Changed get_player_action() to return None on invalid swap instead of recursing
4. Added continue statements in main loop to handle None returns from get_player_action()

This ensures the scene always exits properly through _transition_to_scene() or _quit_whole_game() as required by the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's just returning from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the error message, this is an antipattern.

When the battle ends (either player wins or loses), we need to call _quit_whole_game() instead of just returning. This will properly signal the end of the game.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Changed the get_player_action() to return None when no swap is available, and continue the loop instead of recursing
2. Added _quit_whole_game() call when the battle ends instead of just returning
3. Made the main loop continue instead of return when an action is None

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly ending the game when a battle concludes. The scene will now explicitly quit the game when a winner is determined, rather than just returning from the run method.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

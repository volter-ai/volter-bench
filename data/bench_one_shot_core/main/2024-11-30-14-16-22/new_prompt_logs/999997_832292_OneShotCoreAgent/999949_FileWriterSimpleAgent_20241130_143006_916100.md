Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
From the architecture document:
> The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

The issue is in MainGameScene.get_player_action(). When showing skills or swap choices, we need to:
- Add a "Back" button to the choices
- If Back is selected, return to the main Attack/Swap menu by recursively calling get_player_action()
- Keep the same pattern for both Attack and Swap submenus

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes in get_player_action():
1. Added Back button to both skill choices and creature choices
2. Added logic to handle Back button selection by recursively calling get_player_action()
3. Maintained the same pattern for both Attack and Swap submenus
4. Kept the None return for when no creatures are available to swap

This implements the Back functionality as specified in the architecture while maintaining the existing game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. The test is failing because it's not handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the battle ends. This is expected behavior - the engine uses this exception for graceful termination.

Just like in test_main_menu_scene.py, we need to:
1. Patch both exit methods (_transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game)
2. Catch both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Verify that one of the exit methods was called

This matches how the engine expects scenes to terminate and follows the same pattern used in test_main_menu_scene.py.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 093b4eae-611a-40d2-971f-0082668deae8
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"Starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game ended via quit in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "Scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added proper mocking of both exit methods
4. Added assertion to verify proper scene exit
5. Added cleanup in finally block

This maintains consistency with the engine's architecture and matches how test_main_menu_scene.py handles scene termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

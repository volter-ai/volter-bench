Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
From the architecture document:
> When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.

The issue is that we're not resetting creature HP when the battle ends. Looking at the models:
- Creatures have both `hp` and `max_hp` fields
- We need to reset `hp` to `max_hp` for all creatures when leaving the scene
- This should happen before _quit_whole_game() is called

Since models must be pure data schemas, we'll do this in the MainGameScene before quitting. We'll reset both the player's and opponent's creatures to ensure clean state.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

            return True
            
        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Added reset_all_creatures() method to handle resetting creature HP
2. Called reset_all_creatures() before _quit_whole_game() in run()
3. Reset both player and opponent creatures to ensure clean state

This ensures that when the scene ends, all creatures are restored to their original HP values, maintaining the game state as specified in the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

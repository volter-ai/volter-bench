Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is in the test file. The test is failing because we're not catching the `_QuitWholeGame` exception that's raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught, as indicated by the error message.

Looking at the other test files that passed, particularly test_main_menu_scene.py, we need to:
1. Catch the `_QuitWholeGame` exception in our test
2. Add it to the list of expected exceptions that indicate a successful test run
3. Keep the same pattern of printing how the scene ended for debugging purposes

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7e1eb714-7bae-4ebe-9b84-7a4a650844cb
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle might take more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0. Ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print("Game ended gracefully via _quit_whole_game")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for `AbstractApp` to access the `_QuitWholeGame` exception
2. Added exception handler for `AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame`
3. Added debug print statement to show how the scene ended

This fix:
- Stays within the engine's capabilities
- Doesn't require changes to the models or game logic
- Properly handles the expected game termination
- Maintains the testing framework's ability to verify the scene works correctly

The test will now pass as it properly handles both ways a scene can end: either through the random mode counter reaching zero or through a proper game end via `_quit_whole_game`.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

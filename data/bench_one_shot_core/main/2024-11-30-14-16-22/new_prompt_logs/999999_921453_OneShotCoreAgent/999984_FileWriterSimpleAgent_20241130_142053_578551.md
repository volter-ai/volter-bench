Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. According to the engine's requirements, every scene must end with one of these calls.

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when the battle ends (in `_check_battle_end`), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` after showing the victory/defeat message.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 06d8d275-674e-4303-9cb4-ef418cae5f52

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` after we determine the battle has ended. This ensures we properly exit the scene according to the engine's requirements. The rest of the implementation remains the same.

This fix:
1. Maintains all the existing game logic
2. Properly signals the end of the game to the engine
3. Follows the engine's scene transition requirements
4. Doesn't require any changes to the models or other parts of the architecture

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

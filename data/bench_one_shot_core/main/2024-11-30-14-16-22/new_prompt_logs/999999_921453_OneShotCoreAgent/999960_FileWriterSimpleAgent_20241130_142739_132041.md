Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:

The issues to fix are:
a) Missing "Back" option in choice phases
b) No forced swapping when creatures are knocked out
c) No state reset when leaving scene

Solution approach:
1. Add "Back" button to skill/creature selection menus
2. Add forced creature swap when active creature is KO'd
3. Add reset_creatures method to restore HP when leaving scene
4. Keep models as pure data schemas
5. Keep all game logic in scene
6. Use proper engine methods for all interactions

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to both skill and creature selection menus
2. Implemented forced creature swapping when active creature is KO'd
3. Added reset_creatures method to restore HP when battle ends
4. Added better battle status display showing all creatures' HP
5. Improved turn resolution to prevent attacks after creature is KO'd
6. Added proper feedback messages for swaps and KOs
7. Maintained all engine patterns and architecture requirements
8. Kept models as pure data schemas

The implementation now fully matches the architecture description while staying within engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The error occurs when we try to present choices for swapping creatures but there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens because we filter out both knocked-out creatures AND the active creature, which could leave us with no choices.

The solution is to:
1. Only show the Swap button if there are actually valid creatures to swap to
2. Check for valid swap targets before presenting the Swap option
3. Keep the Attack option always available since creatures always have skills
4. Keep models as pure data schemas
5. Keep all logic in the scene

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

Key changes:
1. Added get_valid_swap_targets() helper method to centralize swap target logic
2. Modified get_player_action() to only show Swap option when valid swap targets exist
3. Kept all models as pure data schemas
4. Maintained same game logic and functionality
5. Fixed the empty choices list error by ensuring choices are always available

This ensures we never try to present an empty list of choices to the player while maintaining the game's core mechanics and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

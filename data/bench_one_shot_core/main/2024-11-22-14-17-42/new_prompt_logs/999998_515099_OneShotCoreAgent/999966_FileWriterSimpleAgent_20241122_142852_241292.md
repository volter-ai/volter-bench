Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that `uuid` is not imported in main.py. This is a simple import issue that can be fixed by adding the import statement. The error occurs in the `create_bot` method when trying to generate a unique ID for the bot.

The fix needs to:
- Add the missing import while maintaining all architectural guidelines
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Not affect any of the game logic

2. Here's the fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: c4ce83f6-8357-48e8-8801-a8910e73cf3f
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, AbstractApp, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player_1"))
```

The only change needed was adding `import uuid` at the top of the file. This maintains all architectural guidelines while fixing the NameError that was causing the tests to fail.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

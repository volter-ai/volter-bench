Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_skills`, but AbstractThing objects cannot be used as dictionary keys because they raise a FixableException when hashed. This is by design to prevent using Things directly as keys.

The solution is to use the player's `uid` as the dictionary key instead of the player object itself. The `uid` is a string which is hashable and is guaranteed to be unique for each player.

I'll rewrite the MainGameScene to fix this:

# Excerpt ID: c9a6800c-62ee-425a-a711-e72b57138e4b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will use player.uid as key instead of player object

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name} ({skill.skill_type} type)" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Battle Start!")

        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            self.opponent_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            if self.resolution_phase():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.queued_skills[self.player.uid] = choice.thing

    def opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        # Determine order based on speed
        first = self.player
        second = self.opponent
        if self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
            first, second = second, first
        elif self.opponent_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first

        # Execute skills in order
        for attacker in [first, second]:
            defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature if attacker == self.player else self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
            
            skill = self.queued_skills[attacker.uid]
            
            # Calculate damage
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
            
            # Type effectiveness
            factor = self.get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
            final_damage = int(raw_damage * factor)
            
            # Apply damage
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
            
            # Show result
            effectiveness = "It's super effective!" if factor > 1 else "It's not very effective..." if factor < 1 else ""
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")
            
            # Check for battle end
            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                winner = attacker
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{winner.display_name} wins!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return True

        self.queued_skills.clear()
        return False

    def get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"water": 0.5, "leaf": 2.0},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Using `player.uid` instead of player object as dictionary key in `queued_skills`
2. Accessing skills using `attacker.uid` instead of attacker object directly

This maintains the proper use of AbstractThing objects while still allowing us to associate skills with players during battle. The uid is a safe key to use since it's a string and guaranteed unique per player.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model. This violates the rule that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from Creature model
2. Move the HP reset logic into the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene when needed

This follows the architecture better since:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Game logic stays in scenes
- We're working within engine capabilities

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: ac928181-befc-4e09-85e7-31cf9f455e9c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        
        # Reset creatures at start
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle Scene ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild bot appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)
            
            # Resolution phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            # Check win conditions
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [DictionaryChoice(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return creature.skills[choices.index(choice)]

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        # Apply damage
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
        
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"You used {player_skill.display_name} for {player_skill.damage} damage!\n"
            f"Foe used {bot_skill.display_name} for {bot_skill.damage} damage!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reset() method from Creature model
2. Directly set hp = max_hp in the scene where needed
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required
4. All game logic remains in the scene

This should resolve the test failures while maintaining proper architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

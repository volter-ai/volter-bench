Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine architecture, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- End the entire game using `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: After a battle ends in MainGameScene, we should return to the main menu using `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`. This creates a proper game loop where players can:
1. Start at main menu
2. Play a battle
3. Return to main menu to either play again or quit

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: d4e06609-5e9c-490c-ada1-aeacd277c53a
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)

                    return

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):

        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        p1, c1, _ = action1

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, skill, defender):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense

        effectiveness = self._get_type_effectiveness(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        
        return int(raw_damage * effectiveness)

    def _get_type_effectiveness(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        if attacker == self.player:
            defender = self.opponent
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            defender = self.player
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. After `_check_battle_end()` returns True, we now call `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` instead of just breaking
2. Added `return` statements after the transitions to ensure the scene properly exits
3. Kept all the game logic and model handling the same, just fixed the scene transition flow

This maintains the proper scene lifecycle required by the engine while keeping all the game mechanics intact.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

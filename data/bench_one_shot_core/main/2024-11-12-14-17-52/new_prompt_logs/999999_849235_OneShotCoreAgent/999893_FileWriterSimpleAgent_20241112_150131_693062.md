Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Solution Description:
The issue is that we're missing the "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase as specified in the architecture document. According to the docs, when a player chooses "Attack" or "Swap", they should be shown their choices AND a "Back" option to return to the previous menu.

To fix this, we need to:
- Add a "Back" button to both the attack and swap choice menus
- Handle the back button by returning to the main choice menu
- Use a loop in get_player_action to allow returning to the main menu
- Keep the scene's data model pure
- Stay within the engine's capabilities using Buttons and SelectThing

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" button to attack and swap choice menus
2. Split get_player_action into two versions (one with back button for humans, one without for bots)
3. Added include_back parameter to choice methods
4. Added loop in get_player_action to handle returning to main menu
5. Maintained all existing battle logic
6. Kept the scene's interface with the engine intact
7. Added proper handling of back button choices

This implementation now fully matches the architecture document's requirements while maintaining the engine's capabilities and keeping the models pure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix two issues in the MainGameScene:

1. Equal Speed Handling:
- When creatures have equal speed, we need to randomly decide who goes first
- We can use Python's random.choice() for this

2. Leaf Type Implementation:
- Add "leaf" type effectiveness calculations
- Update the type effectiveness logic to match documentation:
  - Fire > Leaf, Fire < Water
  - Water > Fire, Water < Leaf  
  - Leaf > Water, Leaf < Fire
  - Normal is neutral against all types

Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:

1. Added random speed tie resolution:
# Excerpt ID: 9c8d5b54-b960-4d4c-807b-e157652e96f9
```python
if player_speed == bot_speed:
    actors = [(self.player, player_action), (self.bot, bot_action)]
    random.shuffle(actors)  # Randomly reorder the list
```

2. Implemented complete type effectiveness system using a type matchup matrix:
# Excerpt ID: 9968b60f-d3c5-4ee7-836c-dec85c8f497c
```python
type_matchups = {
    "fire": {
        "leaf": 2.0,   # Super effective
        "water": 0.5   # Not very effective
    },
    "water": {
        "fire": 2.0,   # Super effective
        "leaf": 0.5    # Not very effective
    },
    "leaf": {
        "water": 2.0,  # Super effective
        "fire": 0.5    # Not very effective
    }
}
```

This implementation now fully matches the architecture documentation requirements for both speed tie resolution and type effectiveness calculations.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in the test. The error shows an infinite loop of transitions between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, eventually leading to a QuitWholeGame exception that isn't caught.

The test needs to:
1. Mock the transitions to prevent infinite recursion
2. Catch both TransitionFromScene and QuitWholeGame exceptions
3. Follow the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py which successfully handles these cases

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: db139a2a-80a8-4144-9a29-a8b4448c4d1b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                mock_transition.reset_mock()
                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added mocking of scene transitions to prevent infinite recursion
3. Added proper cleanup of mocks between test iterations
4. Followed the same pattern as the working main_menu_scene test

The test now properly handles all ways the scene can exit:
- Via transition (TransitionFromScene)
- Via random mode timeout (RandomModeGracefulExit) 
- Via game quit (AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame)

This allows the test to properly verify the MainGameScene's behavior without getting stuck in transition loops.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The current implementation just breaks from the loop when the battle ends. Instead, we should:
1. When battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene if player won
2. Or quit the whole game if player lost
3. Keep all the battle logic intact but ensure proper scene transitions

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Modified check_battle_end() to return "win"/"lose"/None instead of bool
2. Added proper scene transitions:
   - On win: Return to MainMenuScene
   - On lose: Quit the whole game
3. Removed the break statement and replaced with proper transitions
4. Maintained all the existing battle logic
5. Kept the scene's interface with the engine intact

This fixes the issue while staying within the engine's architecture and maintaining the separation between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

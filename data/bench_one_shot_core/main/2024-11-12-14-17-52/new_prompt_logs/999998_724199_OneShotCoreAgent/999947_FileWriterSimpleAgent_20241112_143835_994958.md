Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, every scene must explicitly end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene via `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game via `_quit_whole_game()`

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when the battle ends (either win or lose), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game session.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 981b098c-cc1d-4c65-a32a-f0d0757860b4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            # Execute skills
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game when battle is over

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(*second)
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game when battle is over

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(player, choices).thing

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):
        p1, c1, _ = action1
        p2, c2, _ = action2
        
        if c1.speed > c2.speed:
            return action1, action2
        elif c2.speed > c1.speed:
            return action2, action1
        else:
            return random.choice([(action1, action2), (action2, action1)])

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill):
        defender = self.opponent if attacker == self.player else self.player
        defender_creature = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature

        # Calculate raw damage
        raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        
        # Apply type multiplier
        multiplier = self._get_type_multiplier(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * multiplier)
        
        # Apply damage
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is that we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, rather than just breaking from the loop. This ensures we properly terminate the game session according to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

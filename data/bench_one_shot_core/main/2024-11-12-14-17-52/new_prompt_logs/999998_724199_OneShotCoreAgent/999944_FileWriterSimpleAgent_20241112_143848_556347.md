Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how we handle it in test_main_menu_scene.py where we catch both TransitionFromScene and RandomModeGracefulExit.

We need to:
1. Add _QuitWholeGame to the exceptions we catch in the test
2. Mock the quit_whole_game method like we do in the menu scene test
3. Add assertions to verify the game ended properly

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 167dd604-4928-41a9-8889-50ebac6cdb2a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game ended via quit in run {i}")
                else:
                    # Assert that the game ended properly via quit
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Game did not end with _quit_whole_game"
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added mock for _quit_whole_game method
3. Added catch for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
4. Added assertion to verify the game ended properly
5. Added cleanup in finally block

This maintains the architecture and capabilities of the engine while properly testing that the battle scene ends correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

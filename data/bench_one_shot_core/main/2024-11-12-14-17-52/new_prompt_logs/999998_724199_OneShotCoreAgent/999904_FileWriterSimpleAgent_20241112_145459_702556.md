Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field but it's not being set in the JSON data. Since active_creature is a required field in the Player model but shouldn't be set initially (it gets set when the battle starts), we need to make it Optional.

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. In models.py, change the active_creature field to be Optional[Creature] instead of Creature
2. This matches the game design since a player doesn't have an active creature until they enter battle
3. This stays within the engine's capabilities since Optional types are supported
4. This maintains the pure data schema requirement since we're just modifying the type annotation

Here's the fixed models.py:

# Excerpt ID: aaba438c-aa46-46ba-9180-e67e5e7348a6
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change:
1. Maintains the data schema purity
2. Properly represents that players start without an active creature
3. Allows the MainGameScene to set the active_creature when battle starts
4. Fixes the validation error while staying within engine capabilities
5. Keeps all model relationships direct (not using IDs)

The Optional type with None default means the field is allowed to be missing in the JSON data, which fixes our validation error while maintaining proper typing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

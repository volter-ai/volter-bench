Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix two issues in the MainGameScene:

1. Add "Back" option in the Player Choice Phase:
- When showing skills after "Attack"
- When showing creatures after "Swap"
- This allows players to return to the main choice menu

2. Add forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
- After damage calculation, check if the defender's HP reached zero
- If so, force the owner to swap to a valid creature
- Only allow continuing if they have valid creatures to swap to

The fix only requires changes to main_game_scene.py since this is game logic that belongs in scenes, not models.

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" option in get_player_action:
   - For both Attack and Swap menus
   - Uses a while loop to allow returning to main menu
   
2. Added forced swapping with handle_knocked_out_creature:
   - Checks after each action in resolve_turn
   - Forces swap if active creature is knocked out
   - Skips second action if a swap occurred after first action
   
3. Maintained architecture:
   - Kept all game logic in scene
   - No changes to models
   - Used engine's choice system properly
   - Proper scene transitions

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's architecture, this exception is expected and should be caught in tests.

Looking at test_main_menu_scene.py which passes, we can see it properly handles both TransitionFromScene and _QuitWholeGame exceptions. We need to update the main game scene test to handle both possible ways the scene can end:
- Via _QuitWholeGame when player chooses to quit
- Via TransitionFromScene when player chooses to return to menu

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 14acb560-6017-4f1a-b1e0-0027e6f52afb
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition so ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via quit so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
2. Added proper print statements for debugging
3. Maintained same test structure as test_main_menu_scene.py
4. Stays within engine capabilities
5. Doesn't modify any models or game logic

This fix ensures we properly catch all expected ways the scene can end while in random testing mode, following the engine's architecture and test patterns.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're trying to show swap choices when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This happens when all non-active creatures are fainted (hp <= 0). In this case, we should only show the "Attack" option and not the "Swap" option.

The fix should be in main_game_scene.py to check if there are valid creatures to swap to before showing the swap option. This stays within the engine's capabilities and maintains the separation between data models and game logic.

Here's the fixed scene file:

        # Reset creatures
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
            
        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Check for valid swap targets before adding the Swap button
2. Only show Swap option if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. This prevents the empty choices list that was causing the assertion error
4. Maintains proper separation of concerns (scene logic vs data models)
5. Uses the engine's choice system properly

The fix stays within the engine's capabilities and maintains the architecture while fixing the bug where we tried to show swap choices when there were no valid creatures to swap to.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. This is similar to how the MainMenuScene test handles it.

We need to:
1. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame exceptions in the test
2. Keep all models as pure data schemas (no changes needed to models.py)
3. Keep the game logic in scenes (no changes needed to main_game_scene.py)
4. Stay within engine capabilities

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 96cced38-21a6-44fd-b45e-9752190a32db
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game ended gracefully via _quit_whole_game")
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game ends gracefully
4. Kept all architecture and models intact
5. Maintained proper test coverage of random runs

This ensures the test properly handles both ways the game can end:
- When random mode counter reaches 0
- When a player wins/loses and the game quits gracefully

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is not properly ending the game when a player wins or loses. According to the error message, we need to call either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()` when the game ends, rather than just breaking from the loop.

The fix is simple - in the MainGameScene, we need to modify the check_battle_end method to call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle is over, rather than just returning True.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Removed the return True/False from check_battle_end()
2. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls when the battle ends
3. Removed the if check_battle_end(): break pattern from run()
4. Kept all models as pure data schemas
5. Maintained proper scene transitions using engine capabilities

This ensures the game properly ends using the engine's mechanisms rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

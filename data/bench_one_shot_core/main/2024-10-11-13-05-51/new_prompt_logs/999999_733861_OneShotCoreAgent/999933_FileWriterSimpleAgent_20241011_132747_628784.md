## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of resetting the state of the player's creatures when transitioning out of the MainGameScene, we need to modify the MainGameScene class. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method called `reset_creatures_state()` to the MainGameScene class.
2. This method will iterate through all creatures of both the player and the opponent, resetting their HP to their max HP.
3. We'll call this method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene in the `battle_end()` method.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require changes to the models, as we're only modifying the scene logic.

Here's the updated MainGameScene file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 3bd6a025-254c-42fa-a3ca-aa1e9aceaa91
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self.battle_end()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def reset_creatures_state(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        
        self.reset_creatures_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated implementation adds the `reset_creatures_state()` method and calls it in the `battle_end()` method just before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that all creatures' HP is reset to their maximum value when leaving the battle scene, addressing the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

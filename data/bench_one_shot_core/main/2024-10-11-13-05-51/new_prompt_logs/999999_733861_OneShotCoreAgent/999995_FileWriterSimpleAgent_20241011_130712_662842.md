## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the game loop is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The test for the full game flow is failing because the MainGameScene is not properly ending or transitioning.

To resolve these issues, we'll make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. After the battle ends, we'll add a prompt to ask the player if they want to play again or quit.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a proper exit condition is met.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: f15553b1-56be-44f8-94b1-1753ae743148
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.game_loop()
            if not self.play_again():
                break
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def game_loop(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, bot_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, bot_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} uses {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

    def play_again(self):
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice == play_again_button
```

This updated MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Wrapping the game_loop in a while loop that continues until the player chooses not to play again.
2. Adding a play_again method that prompts the player to play again or quit after each battle.
3. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene when the player chooses to quit.
4. Resetting the creatures' HP at the beginning of each game loop.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or by allowing the player to quit. This should resolve both the test failures and provide a better game flow for the player.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

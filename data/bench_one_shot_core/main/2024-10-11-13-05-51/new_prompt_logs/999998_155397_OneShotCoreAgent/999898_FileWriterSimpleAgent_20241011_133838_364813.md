## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I understand that the implementation is missing the forced swapping when a creature is knocked out. I'll describe how to fix this issue and then provide the updated `MainGameScene` file.

1. Description of the fix:

To implement forced swapping when a creature is knocked out, we'll make the following changes to the `MainGameScene`:

a. After each attack, we'll check if the defending creature's HP has reached zero.
b. If a creature is knocked out, we'll force the owner to swap to another creature with non-zero HP.
c. If the owner has no more creatures with non-zero HP, we'll end the battle.
d. We'll implement this logic in a new method called `_check_and_force_swap`.
e. We'll call this method after each attack in the `_resolve_turn` method.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the pure data schema nature of the models. It also preserves the existing architecture while adding the required functionality.

2. Updated MainGameScene file:

```

This updated implementation adds the forced swapping functionality when a creature is knocked out, as required by the architecture document. The new `_check_and_force_swap` method is called after each attack in the `_resolve_turn` method, ensuring that players are forced to swap when their active creature is knocked out. The battle ends if a player has no more creatures with non-zero HP.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we renamed the `reset_creatures` method to `reset_game_state` in the `MainGameScene` class, but we didn't update the test file to use the new method name. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll update the `test_main_game_scene.py` file to use the correct method name `reset_game_state` instead of `reset_creatures`.
2. We'll ensure that the `MainGameScene` class has the `reset_game_state` method as we previously defined it.

Let's rewrite the `test_main_game_scene.py` file with this fix:

# Excerpt ID: 6796e58e-6a8c-4d92-ac65-172da5e2e360
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
            main_game_scene.opponent = opponent

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()

                # Reset game state after each run
                main_game_scene.reset_game_state()
```

This change replaces the call to `reset_creatures()` with `reset_game_state()`, which should resolve the AttributeError we were seeing.

To ensure that the `MainGameScene` class has the correct `reset_game_state` method, let's also review and confirm the `main_game_scene.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: c2c0b964-cd46-41e0-962b-dbba49a422bd
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {player_creature.display_name}: HP {player_creature.hp}/{player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {opponent_creature.hp}/{opponent_creature.max_hp}

> Attack
> Swap
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            self.player_turn()
            self.opponent_turn()
            self.resolve_turn()
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
        
        self.reset_game_state()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    # ... (other methods remain the same)

    def reset_game_state(self):
        for player in [self.player, self.opponent]:
            for creature in player.creatures:
                creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self.battle_ended = False
        self.turn_queue.clear()

    # ... (remaining methods stay the same)
```

These changes should resolve the AttributeError in the test and ensure that the game state is properly reset after each test run. The core game logic and architecture remain unchanged, and we're still working within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game after the battle concludes. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to include a loop that continues the battle until it ends.
2. After the battle ends, we'll add logic to either transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the whole game.
3. We'll update the _check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits by either transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or quitting the whole game after the battle ends. The main changes are:

1. Added a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modified the `run` method to continue the battle loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. After the battle ends, added a choice for the player to play again or quit.
4. Based on the player's choice, the scene now either transitions back to the MainMenuScene or quits the whole game.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and ensure that the scene exits properly, fixing both the test failures in test_main_game_scene.py and test_whole_game.py.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly handle the end of the battle and transition back to the MainMenuScene. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to ensure it doesn't terminate without proper scene transition.
3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return to the MainMenuScene when the battle is over.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: bd97288f-cdc8-4d0f-a0b7-d800944cb0ce
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self.battle_ended = False
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
        
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._return_to_main_menu()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._apply_skill(self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._apply_skill(self.opponent, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _apply_skill(self, user: Player, skill: Skill, target: Creature):
        target.hp = max(0, target.hp - skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{user.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{user.display_name}'s {skill.display_name} deals {skill.damage} damage to {target.display_name}!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def _return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This updated version of the MainGameScene addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Ensuring that the `run` method doesn't terminate without proper scene transition.
3. Adding a `_return_to_main_menu` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.

These changes should resolve both the issue of the scene not exiting properly and the problem of terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. The scene will now properly transition back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, allowing the game to continue or end as expected.

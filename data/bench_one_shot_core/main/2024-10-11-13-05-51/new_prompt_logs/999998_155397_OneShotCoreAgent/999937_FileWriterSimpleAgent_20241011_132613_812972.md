## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game after the battle concludes. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the battle_loop method to return to the main menu after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition back to the main menu.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 91c66602-f659-403c-9945-f47e2ce5802b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_turn()
            opponent_skill = self.opponent_turn()

            first, second = self.determine_turn_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            self.execute_turn(first)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break
            self.execute_turn(second)
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.end_battle()

    def player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def opponent_turn(self):

        return choice.thing

    def determine_turn_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, player_skill), (self.opponent, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill), (self.player, player_skill)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_skill), (self.opponent, opponent_skill)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, opponent_skill), (self.player, player_skill)

    def execute_turn(self, turn):
        attacker, skill = turn
        if attacker == self.player:
            attacker_creature = self.player_creature
            defender_creature = self.opponent_creature
        else:
            attacker_creature = self.opponent_creature
            defender_creature = self.player_creature

        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill)
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(factor * raw_damage)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "fire" and creature_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "water" and creature_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "water":
            return 2
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and creature_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.opponent_creature.hp == 0

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the battle scene properly exits and transitions back to the main menu after the battle concludes. The key changes are:

1. We've modified the `battle_loop` method to call `self.end_battle()` after the battle ends.
2. We've added an `end_battle` method that displays the battle result and then transitions back to the main menu using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which should resolve the test failures we were seeing.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

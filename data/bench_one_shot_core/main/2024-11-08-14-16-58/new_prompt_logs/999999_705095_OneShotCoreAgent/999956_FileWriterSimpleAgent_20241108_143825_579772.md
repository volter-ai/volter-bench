Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
The issue is in MainGameScene's _resolve_turn method. Currently, when creatures have equal speed, it defaults to one creature instead of randomly choosing. According to the architecture document:

"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

The fix is simple - we'll modify the speed comparison logic in _resolve_turn to use random.choice when speeds are equal. This stays within the engine's capabilities since:
- It only modifies scene logic, not models
- Uses Python's built-in random module
- Maintains the pure data schema nature of models

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 9241908b-6260-438a-a14b-61761533ee02
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order based on speed
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            creatures = [self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature]
            first = random.choice(creatures)
            second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        else:
            # Otherwise use speed to determine order
            first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
            second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature

        # Set skills based on which creature goes first
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        # First attack
        damage = self._calculate_damage(first, second, first_skill)
        second.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

        # Second attack if still alive
        if second.hp > 0:
            damage = self._calculate_damage(second, first, second_skill)
            first.hp -= damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are in the _resolve_turn method:
1. Added explicit check for equal speeds
2. When speeds are equal, uses random.choice to pick first attacker
3. Maintains all other battle logic and architecture requirements
4. Keeps models as pure data schemas
5. Uses only engine-provided capabilities

This implementation now correctly handles the equal speed case as specified in the architecture document.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

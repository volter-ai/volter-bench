Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error shows that the Player model requires an `active_creature` field but it's not being provided during initialization. The error occurs because we defined `active_creature` as `Creature | None` without specifying a default value.

To fix this, we need to:
- Keep the models as pure data schemas
- Make `active_creature` optional by setting a default value of None in the Player model
- Add `active_creature` to the player.json data with a default value of null

This approach maintains the engine's architecture while fixing the validation error.

2. Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Excerpt ID: 588a6417-b68a-41cf-97f5-056fee7c0319
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int 
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

# Excerpt ID: 782d437d-1623-4fa7-b9d2-ae5952ca8f09
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": null
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent",
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": null
    }
  }
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Changed `active_creature: Creature | None` to `active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None` in the Player model
2. Added `"active_creature": null` to both player prototypes in player.json

This maintains the pure data schema approach while properly handling the optional active_creature field. The scene logic will still handle setting the active creature during gameplay.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

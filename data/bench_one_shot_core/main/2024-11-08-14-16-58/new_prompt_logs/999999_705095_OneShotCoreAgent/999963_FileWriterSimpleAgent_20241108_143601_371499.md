Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop instead of properly ending the game flow. According to the engine requirements, we must either:
- Transition to another scene (like back to main menu)
- Call quit_whole_game to properly end the game

The fix is simple - in MainGameScene, after a battle ends, we should call _quit_whole_game() to properly terminate the game flow. This follows the engine's requirements for proper scene termination.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 2413b493-6ddd-48d8-aa31-46c39061b4e6
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check win condition
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._quit_whole_game()  # Properly end the game after battle concludes

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5

        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        # First attack
        damage = self._calculate_damage(first, second, first_skill)
        second.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

        # Second attack if still alive
        if second.hp > 0:
            damage = self._calculate_damage(second, first, second_skill)
            first.hp -= damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is adding `self._quit_whole_game()` after the battle ends. This ensures proper scene termination according to the engine's requirements. The rest of the implementation remains the same since it was working correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

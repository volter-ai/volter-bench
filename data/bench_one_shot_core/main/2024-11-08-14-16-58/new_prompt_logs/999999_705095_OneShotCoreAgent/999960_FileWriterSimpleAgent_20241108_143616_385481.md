Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is similar to how we handle it in test_main_menu_scene.py.

We need to:
1. Patch the _quit_whole_game method like we do in the menu scene test
2. Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and the _QuitWholeGame exception
3. Add assertions to verify the scene ended properly

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 76a05a4d-f236-48a7-a284-f5b284fb1ec6
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    # Assert that we ended the scene properly
                    assert mock_quit.called, "Scene did not end with _quit_whole_game"
                finally:
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

This fix:
1. Adds proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame
2. Uses patch to mock the _quit_whole_game method
3. Adds assertions to verify proper scene termination
4. Follows the same pattern as the menu scene test
5. Maintains all the engine's requirements and architecture

The test will now pass while still verifying that the game scene works correctly and ends appropriately.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

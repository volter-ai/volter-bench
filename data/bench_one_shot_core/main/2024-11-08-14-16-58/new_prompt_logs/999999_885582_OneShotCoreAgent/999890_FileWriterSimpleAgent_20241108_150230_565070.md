Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. According to the test output, this exception is expected and should be caught. Looking at other tests in the codebase, we should:

- Keep using _quit_whole_game() to end the battle scene
- Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in the test
- Not modify any models or scene logic since the game is working correctly
- Just fix the test's exception handling

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 1420ce94-6740-4527-9723-86874ceca7a7
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Game ended gracefully: {str(e)}")
                continue  # Continue to next iteration
```

The key changes are:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the caught exceptions
2. Added a print statement to show the graceful exit
3. Added continue to move to next test iteration
4. Kept all other test logic intact

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly handling the expected graceful exit exceptions during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

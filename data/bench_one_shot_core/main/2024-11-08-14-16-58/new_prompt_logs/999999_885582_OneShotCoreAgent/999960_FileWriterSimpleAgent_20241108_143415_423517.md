Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when quitting the game.

The test is running into an infinite loop between MainGameScene and MainMenuScene because:
1. MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene after battle
2. MainMenuScene transitions to MainGameScene on "Play"
3. This continues until _quit_whole_game() is called, which raises _QuitWholeGame

We need to modify the test to properly catch this exception, similar to how test_main_menu_scene.py handles it. We should also patch the transition methods to prevent the infinite loop.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 8ef6f4b2-06d2-4eee-acf0-e730c0392745
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both transition and quit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called

                mock_transition.reset_mock()
                mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:

1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added patching of the _transition_to_scene method to prevent infinite scene transitions
3. Added TransitionFromScene exception to detect when scene transitions occur
4. Added proper assertions to verify the scene exits via transition or quit
5. Added proper cleanup of mocks between test iterations

This follows the same pattern as test_main_menu_scene.py and properly handles all the ways the scene can exit while preventing infinite loops during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

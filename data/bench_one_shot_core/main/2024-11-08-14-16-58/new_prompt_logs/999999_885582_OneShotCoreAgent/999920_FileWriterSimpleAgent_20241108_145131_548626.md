Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the Player model has an `active_creature` field that needs to be initialized, but it's not being set in the JSON data. Since this is a pure data model, we need to handle this in the JSON rather than setting it programmatically.

The fix is to:
1. Add `active_creature` to the player.json prototypes, setting it to null initially
2. Update the Player model to properly type the optional active_creature field

Here are the files that need to be changed:

# Excerpt ID: 124eaec7-1b8c-4767-8f4e-991d40e3e6ad
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractPlayer, AbstractThing, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int 
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = Field(default=None)
```

# Excerpt ID: fdcb5abf-5aa8-46de-9fa1-9829a4a26101
```json main_game/content/player.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "default_player": {
      "display_name": "Default Player",
      "description": "The human player",
      "creatures": ["bubwool", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": null
    },
    "basic_opponent": {
      "display_name": "Basic Opponent", 
      "description": "A basic bot opponent",
      "creatures": ["scizard", "dumbird"],
      "active_creature": null
    }
  }
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Using Field(default=None) in the Player model to properly handle the optional active_creature
2. Adding active_creature field to the JSON prototypes with null value
3. Using Optional[Creature] to properly type the nullable field

This maintains the pure data model approach while properly initializing all required fields through the JSON data.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

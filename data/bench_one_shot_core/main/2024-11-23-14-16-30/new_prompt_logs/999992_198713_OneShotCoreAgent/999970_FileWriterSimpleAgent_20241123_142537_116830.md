Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is that we're not resetting creature HP when leaving MainGameScene. According to the docs: "When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures."

The solution should:
- Reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp when leaving the scene
- Do this before transitioning or quitting
- Keep models as pure data schemas
- Stay within engine capabilities

The fix belongs in MainGameScene since:
- It's scene-specific functionality
- Models should remain pure data schemas
- The engine provides scene transition hooks

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added reset_creatures method to handle HP reset
2. Call reset_creatures for both players before quitting
3. Kept models as pure data schemas
4. Maintained all existing functionality
5. Reset happens before scene transition

This ensures creatures are reset properly while maintaining the architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

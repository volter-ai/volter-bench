Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. The issue is that the MainGameScene breaks from its game loop when the battle ends, but doesn't properly terminate by calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`. According to the engine's architecture, scenes must always end by explicitly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

The fix is to:
1. After a battle ends, transition back to MainMenuScene
2. Keep all the battle logic the same
3. Just add the proper scene transition after showing the win/loss message

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def get_type_multiplier(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` after showing win/loss messages
2. Added `return` statements to properly exit the run method after transitioning
3. Kept all other game logic exactly the same

This follows the engine's requirements that scenes must explicitly transition or quit, while maintaining the existing game mechanics and architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

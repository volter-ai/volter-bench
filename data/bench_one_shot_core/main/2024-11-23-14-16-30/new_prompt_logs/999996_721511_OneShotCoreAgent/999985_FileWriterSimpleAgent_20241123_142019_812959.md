Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's architecture, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at the stack trace, we can see the game is working correctly:
1. Battle happens
2. Player loses
3. Transitions to menu
4. Menu transitions back to game
5. This cycle continues until quit is chosen
6. _QuitWholeGame is raised (which is expected)

We just need to catch this exception in our test, similar to how we catch RandomModeGracefulExit.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 7adeb77d-7804-4693-b3f3-1ded00173314
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"game quit gracefully in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added exception handler for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when game quits gracefully

This maintains the engine's architecture where:
- The game properly transitions between scenes
- The _QuitWholeGame exception is used to terminate the game
- Tests properly handle all expected exceptions
- No changes needed to models or game logic

The test will now pass while still verifying that the game mechanics work correctly through random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

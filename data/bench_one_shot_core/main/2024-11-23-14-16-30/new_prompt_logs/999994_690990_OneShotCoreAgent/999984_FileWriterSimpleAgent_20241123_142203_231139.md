Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature class in models.py. This violates the guideline that models must be pure data schemas without methods.

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset() method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set the hp back to max_hp directly in the scene cleanup

2. Here are the fixed files:

        for creature in self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the reset() method from Creature class
2. Modified _cleanup_and_exit() to directly set hp = max_hp instead of calling reset()
3. Kept all game logic in the scene

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while preserving the same functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

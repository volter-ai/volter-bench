Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the damage calculation in MainGameScene. Currently, we're using integers throughout the calculation, but the architecture specifies we should:
1. Use floats during calculation
2. Convert to integer only at the final step

The fix needs to be made in main_game_scene.py, specifically in the calculate_damage method. We'll:
- Change the damage formula to use floats
- Only convert to int at the very end of the calculation
- Keep all intermediate calculations as floats for maximum precision

2. Here's the fixed file:

# Excerpt ID: 9481e199-ce73-4bb4-82d0-5e54655ad4e7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        # Convert all values to float for calculation
        raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        
        type_effectiveness = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": type_effectiveness = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": type_effectiveness = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":
            if defender.creature_type == "fire": type_effectiveness = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": type_effectiveness = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": type_effectiveness = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": type_effectiveness = 0.5

        # Calculate final damage as float and convert to int only at the end
        final_damage = raw_damage * type_effectiveness
        return int(final_damage)

    def execute_turn(self, first_creature, second_creature, first_skill, second_skill):
        # First attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(first_creature, second_creature, first_skill)
        second_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_creature.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        if second_creature.hp <= 0:
            return

        # Second attack
        damage = self.calculate_damage(second_creature, first_creature, second_skill)
        first_creature.hp -= damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{second_creature.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, player_skill_choices).thing

            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill_choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
            opponent_skill = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, opponent_skill_choices).thing

            # Resolution phase
            if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
                first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
            elif self.opponent_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed:
                first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)
            else:
                if random.random() < 0.5:
                    first = (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
                else:
                    first = (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill, player_skill)

            self.execute_turn(*first)

            # Check win condition
            if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                break
            elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                break

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are in the calculate_damage method where we now:
1. Convert all input values to floats explicitly
2. Perform all calculations using floats
3. Only convert to integer at the final return statement

This ensures maximum precision during calculations while still returning an integer for the final damage value, as required by the architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

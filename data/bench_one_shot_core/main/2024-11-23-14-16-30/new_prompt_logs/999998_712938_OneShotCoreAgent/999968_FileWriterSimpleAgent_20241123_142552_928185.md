Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a player loses all their creatures, the scene just returns from the run method instead of calling `_quit_whole_game()`.

According to the error message:
> Scene terminated without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene` again

The fix is to:
- Replace all `return` statements in MainGameScene with `self._quit_whole_game()`
- Keep models as pure data schemas
- Keep all game logic in scenes
- Properly end the game when a player loses

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Replaced `return` statements with `self._quit_whole_game()`
2. Added proper game end messages before quitting
3. Maintained scene architecture and game logic
4. Kept models as pure data schemas

This ensures the game ends properly through the engine's quit mechanism rather than just returning from the run method.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

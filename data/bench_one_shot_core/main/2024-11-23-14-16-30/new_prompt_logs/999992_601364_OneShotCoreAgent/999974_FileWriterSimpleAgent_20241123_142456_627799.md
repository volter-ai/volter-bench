Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issues:

There are two bugs in main_game_scene.py:
- Using undefined variable `player_action` in execute_action()
- Incorrectly checking hp on Skill object instead of the creature

The solution is to:
- Pass the current player/bot context to execute_action() so it knows which action belongs to whom
- Fix the hp check to look at the defender's active creature instead of the skill
- Keep all game logic in the scene while maintaining models as pure data schemas

2. Here's the complete rewritten main_game_scene.py:

```

The key changes are:
1. Removed reference to undefined `player_action` variable by passing attacker/defender context to execute_action()
2. Fixed hp check to look at defender's active creature instead of skill
3. Maintained all game logic in the scene while keeping models as pure data schemas
4. No changes needed to models.py since the issue was in scene logic

This should resolve both test failures while staying within the engine's capabilities and following the architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution Plan:
- The issue is that creature HP isn't reset when leaving MainGameScene
- According to the architecture, we need to reset creature state when transitioning out
- Since models must be pure data schemas, we can't add reset methods to them
- The reset must happen in the scene before transition
- We'll reset HP to max_hp for all creatures in the player's team before transitioning

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene with creature state reset:

```

Key changes:
1. Added `_reset_creature_states()` method to reset HP values
2. Called `_reset_creature_states()` before transitioning out of battle
3. Reset both player and opponent creatures for completeness
4. Kept models as pure data schemas
5. Maintained all existing game logic and architecture

This fix ensures creatures are reset to their initial state before leaving the battle scene, as required by the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

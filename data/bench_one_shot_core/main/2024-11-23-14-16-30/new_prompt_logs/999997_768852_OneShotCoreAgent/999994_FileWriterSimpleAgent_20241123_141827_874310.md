Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the damage calculation in MainGameScene. Currently it's using:
# Excerpt ID: 3b28ba8c-da13-453e-bdd9-bfe2bf28578b
```python
damage = creature.attack + skill.base_damage - target.hp  # incorrect
```

This is wrong because it's subtracting the target's HP instead of their defense stat. According to the documentation, it should be:
# Excerpt ID: 5cde2597-4c6b-4603-9956-415943f9f74c
```python
damage = creature.attack + skill.base_damage - target.defense  # correct
```

The fix is simple - we just need to modify the damage calculation line in MainGameScene. No changes to models or other architecture are needed since we already have access to all the required stats through our existing model structure.

2. Here's the corrected MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 97f918a7-826a-4fe5-825c-2f2d42e8de9d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_choice = None
        self.bot_choice = None

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}:
HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
ATK: {self.player_creature.attack} DEF: {self.player_creature.defense} SPD: {self.player_creature.speed}

{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}:
HP: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}
ATK: {self.bot_creature.attack} DEF: {self.bot_creature.defense} SPD: {self.bot_creature.speed}

Available Skills:
{[skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills]}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill!")
            self.player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )

            # Bot choice phase
            self._show_text(self.bot, "Bot choosing skill...")
            self.bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )

            # Resolution phase
            first = self.player
            second = self.bot
            first_creature = self.player_creature
            second_creature = self.bot_creature
            
            if self.bot_creature.speed > self.player_creature.speed or \
               (self.bot_creature.speed == self.player_creature.speed and random.random() < 0.5):
                first, second = second, first
                first_creature, second_creature = second_creature, first_creature

            # Execute skills
            for attacker, defender, creature, target in [
                (first, second, first_creature, second_creature),
                (second, first, second_creature, first_creature)
            ]:
                skill = creature.skills[0]  # Only tackle for now
                damage = creature.attack + skill.base_damage - target.defense  # Fixed damage calculation
                target.hp -= max(1, damage)  # Minimum 1 damage

                self._show_text(self.player, 
                    f"{creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")

                if target.hp <= 0:
                    winner = "You" if target == self.bot_creature else "Bot"
                    self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner} won the battle!")
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                    return
```

The fix maintains all architectural requirements while correcting the damage calculation to match the specification.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

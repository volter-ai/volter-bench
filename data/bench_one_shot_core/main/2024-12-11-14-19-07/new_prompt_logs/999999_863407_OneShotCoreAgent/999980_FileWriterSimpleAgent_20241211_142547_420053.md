Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the test is failing because the _QuitWholeGame exception isn't being caught in the test. The test is designed to handle RandomModeGracefulExit, but when the random choices lead to quitting the game, the _QuitWholeGame exception propagates up uncaught.

The solution is to modify the test to catch both types of expected exceptions:
1. RandomModeGracefulExit - when random mode counter hits 0
2. AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame - when random choices lead to quitting the game

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ac5146fa-9960-4c5f-ba39-54fa5e276ea5
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
```

This fix:
1. Imports AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Adds another except clause to catch _QuitWholeGame
3. Maintains the existing architecture and engine capabilities
4. Doesn't require changes to any models or game logic
5. Properly handles both expected ways the random test can end

The test will now pass since it properly handles both the random mode timeout and game quit conditions that can occur during random testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

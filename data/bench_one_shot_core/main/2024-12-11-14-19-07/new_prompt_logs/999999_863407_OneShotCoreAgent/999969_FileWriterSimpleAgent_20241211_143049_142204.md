Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects. Looking at the engine code, SelectThing is a choice type that wraps a thing, and we should be checking its `select_action_type` instead of display_name to identify it.

The fix is to modify the MainGameScene to properly handle SelectThing choices by:
1. Using `isinstance()` to check if it's a Button vs SelectThing
2. For SelectThing, accessing the wrapped thing via the `.thing` property
3. For Button, checking the display_name

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            winner = self.player if player_alive else self.bot

    def _can_continue(self):
        return (any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.player.creatures) and 
                any(c.hp > 0 for c in self.bot.creatures))
```

The key changes are in the `_handle_turn` method where we now use `isinstance(choice, Button)` to check for the "Back" button instead of trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects. This properly handles the choice types provided by the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

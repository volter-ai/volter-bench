Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in test_main_game_scene.py. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When the battle ends naturally (Basic Opponent wins), the scene calls _quit_whole_game() which raises an exception that needs to be caught.

The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (for random mode timeout) and _QuitWholeGame (for natural battle end).

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: b7548559-8b2a-4364-8bcd-be1076568b6b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for complex battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"battle ended naturally")
            
            # Verify creatures were reset
            assert all(c.hp == c.max_hp for c in player.creatures)
            assert player.active_creature is None
            assert scene.bot.active_creature is None
```

Key changes:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to indicate natural battle end
4. Kept the creature state verification assertions

This maintains the architecture while properly handling both ways the scene can end:
- RandomModeGracefulExit when the random mode counter hits 0
- _QuitWholeGame when a player wins the battle

The test now properly handles both cases while still verifying the creatures are reset correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

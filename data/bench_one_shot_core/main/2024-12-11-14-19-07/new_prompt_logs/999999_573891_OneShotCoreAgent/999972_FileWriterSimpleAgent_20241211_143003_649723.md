Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in `main_game_scene.py` where we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects. Looking at the engine code, SelectThing is a choice type that wraps a Thing, and we should be checking its `select_action_type` instead of `display_name` to determine if it's a "Back" button.

The fix is to modify how we handle the choices in the MainGameScene to properly distinguish between SelectThing and Button choices.

Here's the fixed version:

        # Initialize creatures for both players

            for c in p.creatures:
                c.hp = c.max_hp
            p.active_creature = p.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method:
1. Instead of checking `display_name` on SelectThing objects, we now use `isinstance()` to check if the choice is a Button
2. We store the back button in a variable to make the code clearer
3. We use `continue` to loop back when the back button is chosen

This maintains the architecture and stays within the engine's capabilities while fixing the AttributeError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

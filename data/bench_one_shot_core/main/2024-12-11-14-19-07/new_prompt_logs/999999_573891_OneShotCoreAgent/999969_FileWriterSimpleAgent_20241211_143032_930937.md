Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The test failures indicate two issues:

1. The creatures' HP isn't being reset properly after battle (test_main_game_scene.py failure)
2. The MainGameScene isn't properly ending with either a transition or quit_whole_game call (test_whole_game.py failure)

The solution is to:
1. Move the creature reset logic to before we return/quit
2. Call quit_whole_game when the battle ends instead of just breaking from the loop

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added a try/finally block in run() to ensure creatures are always reset
2. Moved the creature reset logic into the finally block
3. Added _quit_whole_game() call after resetting creatures
4. The reset happens regardless of how we exit (RandomModeGracefulExit or normal battle end)

This maintains the architecture while fixing both test failures by ensuring proper cleanup and scene termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

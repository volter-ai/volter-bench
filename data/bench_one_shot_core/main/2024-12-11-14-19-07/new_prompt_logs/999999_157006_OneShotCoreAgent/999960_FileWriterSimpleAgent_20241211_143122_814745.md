Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine requirements, every scene must either:
- Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene`
- End the game using `_quit_whole_game`

Looking at the output, we can see the battle ends ("Basic Opponent wins!") but the scene just returns instead of properly ending the game. Since this is the end of a battle, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` when a player wins.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key change is in the `run` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when `check_battle_end()` returns True. This ensures we properly end the game through the engine's mechanisms rather than just letting the scene end naturally.

This fix:
- Follows the engine's requirements for scene transitions/endings
- Maintains all the game logic and architecture
- Properly signals game completion to the engine
- Fixes the test failure by ensuring the scene always ends properly

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

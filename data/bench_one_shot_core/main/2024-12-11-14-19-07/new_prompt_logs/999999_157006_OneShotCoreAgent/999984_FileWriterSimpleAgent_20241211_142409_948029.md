Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're getting into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, which eventually hits quit_whole_game(). The issue is in our test_main_game_scene.py - we're not properly handling scene transitions in our test.

The solution is to:
1. Mock the _transition_to_scene method in our test to prevent the infinite loop
2. Add proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and _QuitWholeGame
3. Add assertions to verify the battle actually happened (by checking the text outputs)

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 3bf4c133-5b73-4ef2-8798-50f6c3ddae85
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp

from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for battle

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Track if battle happened
            battle_happened = False
            battle_ended = False

            def mock_show_text(player, text):
                nonlocal battle_happened, battle_ended
                if "used" in text and "damage" in text:
                    battle_happened = True
                if "won" in text or "lost" in text:
                    battle_ended = True
                print(text)

            # Patch the scene to prevent infinite transitions
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene') as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_show_text', side_effect=mock_show_text):
                
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully in run {i}")
                
                # Assert that battle actually happened
                assert battle_happened, "No battle actions were recorded"
                assert battle_ended, "Battle did not reach an end state"
                assert mock_transition.called, "Scene should transition after battle ends"
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper mocking of _transition_to_scene to prevent infinite loops
2. Added tracking of battle progress through _show_text
3. Added proper assertions to verify battle functionality
4. Added proper exception handling for both possible exit conditions
5. Added verification that the scene properly transitions after battle

This maintains the engine's architecture while properly testing the MainGameScene in isolation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

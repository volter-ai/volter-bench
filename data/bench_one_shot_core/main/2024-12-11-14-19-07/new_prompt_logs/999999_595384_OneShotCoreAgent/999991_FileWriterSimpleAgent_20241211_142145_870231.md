Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods. Instead, I should:

- Remove the `reset()` method from the Creature model
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- In MainGameScene, simply set hp = max_hp directly when resetting creatures
- This follows the architecture where all logic lives in scenes and models are pure data schemas

2. Here are the files that need to be fixed:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")

"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "A wild creature appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, "Battle start!")

        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.player, 
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
            )
            skill_index = [s.display_name for s in self.player_creature.skills].index(player_skill.display_name)
            player_skill = self.player_creature.skills[skill_index]

            # Bot turn
            bot_skill = self._wait_for_choice(
                self.bot,
                [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
            )
            skill_index = [s.display_name for s in self.bot_creature.skills].index(bot_skill.display_name)
            bot_skill = self.bot_creature.skills[skill_index]

            # Resolve turns
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
                break

            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe's {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before returning to menu
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the `reset()` method from Creature model
2. Replaced `self.player_creature.reset()` with direct hp assignment in MainGameScene
3. Models are now pure data schemas as required

This maintains the same functionality while properly separating data models from logic according to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

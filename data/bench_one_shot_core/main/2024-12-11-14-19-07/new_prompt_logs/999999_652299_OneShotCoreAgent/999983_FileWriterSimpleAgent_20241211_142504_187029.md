Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

In our MainGameScene, after the battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop without doing either. We should:
- After showing the battle result, transition back to MainMenuScene to let the player play again
- Or quit the whole game

Given this is a simple game, let's transition back to MainMenuScene after each battle.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 53c4d643-4836-4fd0-ac79-46f1175584f2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available Skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Bot Choice Phase
            bot_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.bot, self.bot_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, bot_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                # Transition back to main menu after battle ends
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _get_skill_choice(self, player, creature):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, creature_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == creature_type:
            return 1.0
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1.0)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        factor = self._get_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * factor)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, bot_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.bot_creature.speed else self.bot_creature
        second = self.bot_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else bot_skill
        second_skill = bot_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        if self.player_creature.speed == self.bot_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first
                first_skill, second_skill = second_skill, first_skill

        # Execute skills
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, first_skill), (second, first, second_skill)]:
            if defender.hp > 0:  # Only attack if defender is still alive
                damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
                defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method where we now properly transition back to MainMenuScene after the battle ends, rather than just breaking from the loop. This follows the engine's architecture requirement that scenes must always end with a transition or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're getting into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, which eventually triggers a QuitWholeGame exception. The issue is in our test setup - we need to properly handle scene transitions in the test.

Looking at the stack trace, we see:
MainGameScene -> MainMenuScene -> MainGameScene -> MainMenuScene (repeating)

The solution is to modify the test to catch transitions between scenes, similar to how the MainMenuScene test works. We should patch both possible exit conditions (_transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game) and consider either a success.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 46b0cd5a-0766-435d-b1b8-46db19b71ca9
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle might take more turns

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # patch both exit methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` via transition")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash")
                else:
                    # assert that we exited the scene in one of the expected ways
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for TransitionFromScene
2. Patched both _transition_to_scene and _quit_whole_game methods
3. Added assertions to verify the scene exits properly
4. Added proper cleanup in finally block

This matches the pattern used in test_main_menu_scene.py and properly handles the scene transitions in the test environment. The test will now pass since it catches the transition back to MainMenuScene and considers it a successful test case.

The actual game logic remains correct - we want the game to cycle between menu and battle. It's just the test that needed to be fixed to properly handle these transitions in the test environment.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

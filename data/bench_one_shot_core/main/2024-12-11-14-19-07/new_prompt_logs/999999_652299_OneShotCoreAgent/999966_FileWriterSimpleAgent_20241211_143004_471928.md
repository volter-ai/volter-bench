Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because we're trying to access `display_name` on SelectThing objects, but SelectThing is a choice wrapper that doesn't have this attribute directly. Instead, we need to check the choice type and handle SelectThing differently from Button.

For SelectThing choices:
- We should check if the choice is an instance of SelectThing
- If it is, we can access the wrapped thing via choice.thing
- If not, it's a Button and we can use display_name

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

                return True
        return False
```

The key changes are in the `get_player_action` method where we now properly check for SelectThing instances instead of trying to access display_name directly. This maintains the architecture while fixing the error.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

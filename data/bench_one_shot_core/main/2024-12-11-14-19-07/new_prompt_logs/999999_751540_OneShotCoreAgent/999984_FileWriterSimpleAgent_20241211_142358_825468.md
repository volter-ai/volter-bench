Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the Issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling scene transitions in the test. The test is running into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, which eventually triggers a _QuitWholeGame exception that isn't caught.

The solution is to modify the test to properly handle scene transitions by mocking them. Instead of actually transitioning between scenes, we should catch the transition attempt and end the test. This is similar to how the MainMenuScene test works.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: d8cf0937-97e5-433f-b2c2-4d7d7ef49883
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Battle might take more moves

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch the transition method to catch the scene exit
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene):
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene exited via transition in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0 in run {i}")
```

The key changes are:
1. Added a custom TransitionFromScene exception
2. Patched _transition_to_scene to raise this exception
3. Properly catch and handle both possible ways the scene can end (transition or random mode timeout)

This follows the engine's architecture by:
1. Keeping the models as pure data schemas
2. Properly testing scene behavior
3. Maintaining the scene transition system while making it testable
4. Not modifying any core engine functionality

The test will now properly verify that the MainGameScene runs correctly and exits via scene transition when a battle ends, without getting caught in an infinite loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

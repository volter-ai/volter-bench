Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (when a creature is defeated), the scene just breaks from its loop without calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine's requirements, every scene must explicitly end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`
- Ending the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

Solution:
I'll modify MainGameScene to return to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends. This creates a proper game loop where players can:
1. Start at menu
2. Play a battle
3. Return to menu to play again or quit

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 1408129d-7e9f-443e-a203-bfd325777090
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

        self._show_text(defender, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {effectiveness}")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Enemy {self.player_creature.display_name} was defeated!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Enemy {self.opponent_creature.display_name} was defeated!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} was defeated!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper scene transition after battle ends
2. Added a message to inform player they're returning to menu
3. Properly returns from run() after transitioning

This maintains the engine's requirements while providing a complete game loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

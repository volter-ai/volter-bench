Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Fix Description:
Looking at the architecture docs, specifically main_game_scene.md, it states: "When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures." This means we need to reset creature HP to max_hp when transitioning away from MainGameScene.

The fix should:
- Reset HP before transitioning back to MainMenuScene
- Apply to both player and bot creatures
- Keep models as pure data schemas
- Handle this in the scene logic

Since models must remain pure data schemas, we'll do this in the scene's end_battle method right before the transition. This maintains separation of concerns and follows the architecture guidelines.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: 9be5ba8f-9482-408c-8c30-bbc68017e6d6

        self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!" if player_lost else "You won!")

        for p in [self.player, self.bot]:
            for c in p.creatures:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

The key change is in the end_battle method, where we now reset all creatures' HP to their max_hp before transitioning back to the main menu. This ensures creatures are ready for the next battle and maintains the state reset requirement from the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

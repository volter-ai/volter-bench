Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error occurs because MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the engine's architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

Currently, when the battle ends (win or lose), we just break from the loop. Instead, we should:
1. After showing the battle result message, transition back to MainMenuScene
2. Keep the models as pure data schemas
3. Keep all game logic in the scenes
4. Maintain proper scene transitions according to engine requirements

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

Key changes:
1. Added proper scene transitions after battle ends
2. Added transitions after handling knocked out creatures
3. Removed direct returns/breaks that would exit the scene improperly
4. Maintained all game logic within the scene
5. Kept models as pure data schemas
6. Properly followed engine architecture requirements for scene transitions

The scene now properly transitions back to MainMenuScene when the battle ends, rather than just breaking from the loop.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

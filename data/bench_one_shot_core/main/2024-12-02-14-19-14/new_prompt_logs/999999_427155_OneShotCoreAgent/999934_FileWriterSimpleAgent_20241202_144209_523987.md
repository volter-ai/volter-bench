Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because it's not catching the expected GracefulExit exception that occurs when transitioning back to MainMenuScene and then quitting.

According to the engine architecture:
- GracefulExit exceptions are expected and should be caught
- The test should handle both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
- We don't need to modify any models or game logic
- We just need to properly handle the expected exceptions in the test

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ae3a304a-d66a-4f56-9125-c46e01264da3
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import (
    HumanListener, 
    RandomModeGracefulExit, 
    AbstractApp,
    GracefulExit
)
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                # Both exceptions are expected - either from random mode timeout
                # or from transitioning back to menu and quitting
                print(f"Run {i} completed with expected exit: {str(e)}")
            except Exception as e:
                # Re-raise any unexpected exceptions
                raise e
```

Key changes:
1. Added proper exception handling for both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added better logging of expected exits
3. Still re-raises unexpected exceptions
4. Maintains test coverage while properly handling engine's graceful exit system
5. No changes needed to models or game logic

This fix properly handles the expected graceful exit when the battle scene transitions back to the menu scene and then quits, while still catching any actual errors that might occur during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

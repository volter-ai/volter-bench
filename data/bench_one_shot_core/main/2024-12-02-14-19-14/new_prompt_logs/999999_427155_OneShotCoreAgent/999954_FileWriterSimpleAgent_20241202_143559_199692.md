Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Fix Description:
The error is a simple NameError because the `random` module wasn't imported in main_game_scene.py. The fix is straightforward - we just need to add the import at the top of the file.

This doesn't affect any architectural concerns since:
- It's just adding an import to a scene file
- Doesn't change any models
- Doesn't affect the engine capabilities
- Maintains separation of concerns

2. Here's the complete fixed file:

```

The only change was adding `import random` at the top of the file. This should resolve the NameError while maintaining all architectural requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

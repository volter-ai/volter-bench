Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Fix Description:
The issue is in the `resolve_turn` method of `MainGameScene` where we need to handle speed ties randomly. Currently, we just sort by speed, but according to the docs:

"If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first."

To fix this, I'll modify the sorting in `resolve_turn` to use a custom key function that:
1. First compares by speed
2. If speeds are equal, uses random.random() to break the tie
3. This ensures equal-speed creatures have a 50/50 chance of going first

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the `resolve_turn` method where I added a custom `speed_sort_key` function that uses `random.random()` as a tiebreaker when speeds are equal. This ensures that creatures with equal speed have an equal chance of going first, as specified in the architecture documentation.

The rest of the file remains unchanged as it was working correctly. This fix maintains all the architectural guidelines while implementing the random speed tie resolution requirement.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

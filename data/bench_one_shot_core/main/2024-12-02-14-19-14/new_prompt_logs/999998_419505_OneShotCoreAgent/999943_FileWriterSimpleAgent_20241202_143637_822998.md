Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine architecture:
- Scenes must always end with either `_transition_to_scene()` or `_quit_whole_game()`
- Breaking from a loop or returning directly is an antipattern
- When the battle ends, we should call `_quit_whole_game()` since it's the end of the game

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the game using `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends, rather than just breaking from the loop.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` instead of just breaking from the loop when the battle ends. This ensures we properly terminate the game according to the engine's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

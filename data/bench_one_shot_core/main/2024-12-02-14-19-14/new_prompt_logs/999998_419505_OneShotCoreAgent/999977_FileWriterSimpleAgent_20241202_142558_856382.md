Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that we're trying to use Player objects as dictionary keys in `queued_skills`, but AbstractThing objects cannot be used as dictionary keys (they raise FixableException when hashed). Instead, we should use the player's uid as the key.

The fix needs to be in main_game_scene.py. We'll modify it to use player.uid instead of the player object as dictionary key.

# Excerpt ID: d0dae75d-8822-45be-8ba1-f377693af331
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.queued_skills = {}  # Will use player.uid as key instead of player object

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

            self._show_text(self.player, 
                f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! Dealt {damage} damage!")
            
            if defender_creature.hp <= 0:
                winner = attacker.display_name
                self._show_text(self.player, f"Game Over! {winner} wins!")
                return True

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Using `self.player.uid` and `self.bot.uid` as dictionary keys instead of the objects themselves
2. Accessing queued skills with `attacker.uid` in the resolution phase

This maintains the proper architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- We don't try to use AbstractThing objects as dictionary keys
- We use the proper unique identifiers (uid) for lookups
- All game logic stays in the scene
- The functionality remains exactly the same, just with proper key usage

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

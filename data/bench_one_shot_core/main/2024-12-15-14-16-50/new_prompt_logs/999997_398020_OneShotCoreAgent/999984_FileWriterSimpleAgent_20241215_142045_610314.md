Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're getting into an infinite loop between MainMenuScene and MainGameScene. When testing MainGameScene directly, we need to catch the scene transitions and quit exceptions properly in the test, similar to how the MainMenuScene test does it.

The solution is to modify the test file to:
- Catch TransitionFromScene exceptions
- Catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions
- Track scene transitions to prevent infinite loops
- Use proper mocking of scene transitions

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: ecde2980-9811-4f3a-9303-b6c82f7ddf78
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Need more moves for battle scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            # Patch both scene transition and quit game methods
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                 patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"Scene transitioned successfully in run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit successfully in run {i}")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, \
                        "Scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper exception handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
2. Added TransitionFromScene exception to catch scene transitions
3. Properly mocked both transition and quit methods
4. Added better logging for debugging
5. Reset mocks between iterations

This follows the engine's architecture by:
- Properly handling all possible scene exit conditions
- Maintaining the scene transition flow
- Working within the engine's capabilities
- Not modifying any models or core game logic
- Keeping the test focused on scene behavior

The test now properly validates that the MainGameScene either transitions or quits as expected, without getting into infinite loops.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

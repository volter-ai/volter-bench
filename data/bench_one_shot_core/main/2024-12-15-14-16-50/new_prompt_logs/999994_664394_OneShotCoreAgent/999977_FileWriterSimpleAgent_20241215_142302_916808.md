Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issues are:
1. `_wait_for_choice` is being called with empty choices list when a player has no valid creatures to swap to
2. The MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting

The fix needs to:
1. Only show the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends instead of just returning
3. Handle the case where a player has no creatures to swap to when their active creature is knocked out

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

Key changes:
1. Only show "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when battle ends instead of just returning
3. Improved error handling around creature swapping
4. Better handling of battle end conditions

The changes stay within the engine's capabilities and maintain the architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Scene handles all game logic
- Proper scene transition methods are used
- Battle flow remains turn-based
- All choices presented to players are valid

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

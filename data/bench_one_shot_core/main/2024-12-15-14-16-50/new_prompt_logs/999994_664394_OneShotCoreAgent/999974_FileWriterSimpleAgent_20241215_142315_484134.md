Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test file - we need to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is expected behavior according to the error message: "If you intended to quit the game, this exception is expected and should be caught".

The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves are exhausted) and _QuitWholeGame (when the game ends naturally).

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 20632fb7-ec0b-41ec-b748-754a633b7669
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected error in run {i}: {str(e)}")

```

The changes:
1. Import AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame exception
2. Add try/except block to catch both expected exceptions
3. Add catch for unexpected exceptions that fails the test
4. Add more descriptive print messages for debugging

This maintains the architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Scene handles game logic
- Tests verify scene behavior
- Engine exceptions are properly handled

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can end:
1. When random moves are exhausted (RandomModeGracefulExit)
2. When the game naturally ends (_QuitWholeGame)

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the MainGameScene to match the architecture documentation by:

1. Explicitly separating turn phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
2. Adding "Back" option in choice menus
3. Adding explicit creature state reset when leaving scene
4. Making the scene structure match the documentation exactly

Here's the fixed implementation:

        self.reset_creatures()

        # Reset all creatures to starting state
        for creature in self.player.creatures:

        # Set initial active creatures
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

Key changes:
1. Separated phases into explicit methods: player_choice_phase(), foe_choice_phase(), resolution_phase()
2. Added "Back" option in player choice menus
3. Added reset_creatures() method and call it when leaving scene
4. Improved phase structure to match documentation exactly
5. Added phase information to __str__ output
6. Maintained all game mechanics while improving structure

The implementation now follows the architecture documentation exactly while staying within engine capabilities and maintaining the separation between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

When leaving this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Let me plan out the implementation:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill (with type, damage, physical/special)
- Creature (with stats, type, skills collection)
- Player (with creatures collection, active creature)

2. Create JSON files in content/ for each model with the prototypes:
- skill.json (Tackle, Fireball, Lick)
- creature.json (Bubwool, Scizard, Dumbird)
- player.json (Default Player, Basic Opponent)

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene (already exists but needs updating)
- MainGameScene (with battle logic, phases, type effectiveness)

4. Create tests for both scenes using random mode testing

Here's the implementation:

```python main_game/models.py

This implementation follows all the guidelines:
1. Models are pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing/AbstractPlayer
2. Models reference other models directly, not by string IDs
3. Models are ordered by dependencies
4. Scenes handle all game logic
5. Scene transitions use proper methods
6. Tests use random mode
7. Scene __str__ methods show all relevant info
8. Models are created using from_prototype_id
9. Bots are created using create_bot and treated like players

The game implements the full creature battle system with:
- Turn-based combat
- Physical/Special attacks
- Type effectiveness
- Creature swapping
- HP tracking and knockouts
- Win/loss conditions

Content: The issue is that the Player model requires an active_creature field, but it's not being initialized in the JSON data. Since active_creature can be None when a player is first created (before battle starts), we should make it Optional in the model.

Here's how I'll fix it:

1. Import Optional from typing in models.py
2. Make active_creature an Optional[Creature] in the Player class
3. This will allow the field to be None by default when creating a player from JSON

Here's the complete fixed models.py file:

```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str  
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int 
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

This change:
1. Follows the model guidelines by keeping models as pure data schemas
2. Uses proper typing with Optional to indicate active_creature can be None
3. Maintains the architecture where active_creature is set during battle in the MainGameScene
4. Stays within engine capabilities by using standard Python typing
5. Fixes the validation error by making the field optional with a None default

The tests should now pass since the Player model won't require active_creature during initialization from JSON data.

Role: assistant
Content: The issues are:
1. `_wait_for_choice` is being called with empty choices list when a player has no valid creatures to swap to
2. The MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting

The fix needs to:
1. Only show the "Swap" option if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends instead of just returning
3. Handle the case where a player has no creatures to swap to when their active creature is knocked out

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

Key changes:
1. Only show "Swap" button if there are valid creatures to swap to
2. Call `_quit_whole_game()` when battle ends instead of just returning
3. Improved error handling around creature swapping
4. Better handling of battle end conditions

The changes stay within the engine's capabilities and maintain the architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Scene handles all game logic
- Proper scene transition methods are used
- Battle flow remains turn-based
- All choices presented to players are valid

Role: assistant
Content: The issue is in the test file - we need to catch the _QuitWholeGame exception that's raised when the game ends. This is expected behavior according to the error message: "If you intended to quit the game, this exception is expected and should be caught".

The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit (when random moves are exhausted) and _QuitWholeGame (when the game ends naturally).

Here's the fixed test file:

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                print(f"Random mode completed successfully for run {i}")
            except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                print(f"Game completed successfully for run {i}")
            except Exception as e:
                pytest.fail(f"Unexpected error in run {i}: {str(e)}")

```

The changes:
1. Import AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame exception
2. Add try/except block to catch both expected exceptions
3. Add catch for unexpected exceptions that fails the test
4. Add more descriptive print messages for debugging

This maintains the architecture where:
- Models remain pure data schemas
- Scene handles game logic
- Tests verify scene behavior
- Engine exceptions are properly handled

The test will now pass since it properly handles both ways the game can end:
1. When random moves are exhausted (RandomModeGracefulExit)
2. When the game naturally ends (_QuitWholeGame)

Content: This is the issue raised during QA/testing

{
  "issue": "A QA pass has detected a problem with the current implementation.",
  "explanation": "The code has several discrepancies with the architecture documentation. The turn phases are not explicitly separated, the 'Back' option is missing in the Player Choice Phase, and the creature state reset is not explicitly handled when leaving the MainGameScene. These issues indicate that the code does not fully implement the described architecture and logic of the game.",
  "qa_result": "failed"
}



Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste

Role: assistant
Content: I'll fix the MainGameScene to match the architecture documentation by:

1. Explicitly separating turn phases (Player Choice, Foe Choice, Resolution)
2. Adding "Back" option in choice menus
3. Adding explicit creature state reset when leaving scene
4. Making the scene structure match the documentation exactly

Key changes:
1. Separated phases into explicit methods: player_choice_phase(), foe_choice_phase(), resolution_phase()
2. Added "Back" option in player choice menus
3. Added reset_creatures() method and call it when leaving scene
4. Improved phase structure to match documentation exactly
5. Added phase information to __str__ output
6. Maintained all game mechanics while improving structure

The implementation now follows the architecture documentation exactly while staying within engine capabilities and maintaining the separation between models and game logic.

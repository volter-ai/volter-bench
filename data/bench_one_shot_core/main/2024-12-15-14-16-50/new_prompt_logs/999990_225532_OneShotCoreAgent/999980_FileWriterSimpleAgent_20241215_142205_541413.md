Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because the MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When a battle ends (win or loss), we just return from the loop instead of explicitly transitioning back to the menu or quitting the game.

According to the error message and engine requirements, every scene must end with either:
- `_transition_to_scene()` to go to another scene
- `_quit_whole_game()` to end the game

The solution is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the scene by transitioning back to MainMenuScene after showing the battle result, or allowing the player to quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added proper scene transition after battle ends
2. Added choice between returning to menu or quitting game
3. Used proper engine methods (_transition_to_scene or _quit_whole_game) to end the scene
4. Maintained all existing game logic and functionality

This should resolve the FixableException while maintaining the game's core mechanics and following the engine's architecture requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

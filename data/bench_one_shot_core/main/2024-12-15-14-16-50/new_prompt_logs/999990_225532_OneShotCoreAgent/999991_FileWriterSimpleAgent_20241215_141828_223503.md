Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The issue is in MainGameScene where we're using `self.player_creature.skills[0].damage` instead of using the actual chosen skill's damage. The DictionaryChoice only stores the display name, which doesn't give us access to the actual skill object.

To fix this:
1. Instead of creating DictionaryChoices with just the skill name, we should use SelectThing choices to select the actual Skill objects
2. This will give us direct access to the chosen skill and its damage value
3. This aligns with the engine's capabilities since SelectThing is designed for this purpose
4. No changes needed to models since they're already correct

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 169b7e66-4034-420a-9e16-0b382f962fed
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp} HP
Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name}: {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp} HP

Available Skills:
{chr(10).join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        # Reset creatures at start of battle
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp

        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self._show_text(self.bot, f"Battle starts against {self.player_creature.display_name}!")

        while True:
            # Player turn
            player_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, 
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills])
            player_skill = player_choice.thing

            # Bot turn
            bot_choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot,
                [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills])
            bot_skill = bot_choice.thing

            # Resolution phase
            self.bot_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
            
            if self.bot_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You lost!")
                break

            self.player_creature.hp -= bot_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Foe {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")

            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost!")
                self._show_text(self.bot, "You won!")
                break

        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

Key changes:
1. Replaced DictionaryChoice with SelectThing for skill selection
2. Used the actual selected skill objects to calculate damage
3. Maintained the same game flow but with correct skill resolution
4. No changes needed to models or other files
5. Stays within engine capabilities by using built-in SelectThing

This implementation now correctly follows the architecture document's specification for the resolution phase, using the actually selected skills rather than defaulting to the first skill.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

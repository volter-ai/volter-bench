Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because we're not properly handling the _QuitWholeGame exception in the test. When MainGameScene transitions to MainMenuScene, and MainMenuScene quits the game, we need to catch this expected behavior in our test.

The fix should:
- Catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame in the test
- Keep all game logic intact
- Stay within engine capabilities
- Maintain proper scene transitions

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: b2f8ec8a-2ede-4d7e-b254-afb97e1bdf8b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            try:
                main_game_scene.run()
            except (RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame) as e:
                print(f"Run {i} completed successfully with: {str(e)}")
                continue
            except Exception as e:
                raise e  # Re-raise unexpected exceptions
```

The key changes are:
1. Added AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame to the caught exceptions
2. Improved error handling to distinguish between expected and unexpected exceptions
3. Added better logging of how the run completed
4. Maintained the test's purpose of ensuring the scene runs without crashing

This fix:
- Properly handles the game's quit mechanism
- Maintains test coverage
- Stays within engine capabilities
- Doesn't require changes to the game logic
- Follows the testing guidelines for random mode testing

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

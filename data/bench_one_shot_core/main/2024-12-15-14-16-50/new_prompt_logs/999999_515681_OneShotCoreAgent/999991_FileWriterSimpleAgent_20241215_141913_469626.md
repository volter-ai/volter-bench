Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene ends without properly transitioning or quitting. When the battle ends, it just breaks from the loop without calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()`.

According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- Transitioning to another scene
- Quitting the whole game

Solution:
After a battle ends, we should:
1. Show the battle result message
2. Return to the main menu using `_transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 24afae67-60b4-42b2-a0cc-0e3341bb0a73
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle Start! {self.player_creature.display_name} vs {self.opponent_creature.display_name}")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._handle_player_turn()
            
            # Opponent Choice Phase  
            opponent_skill = self._handle_opponent_turn()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            # Check win condition
            if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _handle_player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills 
                   if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _handle_opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills 
                   if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        
        # Type effectiveness
        multiplier = 1.0
        if skill.skill_type == "fire":
            if defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "water":

            elif defender.creature_type == "leaf": multiplier = 0.5
        elif skill.skill_type == "leaf":
            if defender.creature_type == "water": multiplier = 2.0
            elif defender.creature_type == "fire": multiplier = 0.5
            
        return int(raw_damage * multiplier)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        # Determine order
        first = self.player_creature if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed else self.opponent_creature
        second = self.opponent_creature if first == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill
        
        # If speeds are equal, randomize
        if self.player_creature.speed == self.opponent_creature.speed:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                first, second = second, first
                first_skill, second_skill = second_skill, first_skill

        # Execute first attack
        damage = self._calculate_damage(first, second, first_skill)
        second.hp = max(0, second.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{first.display_name} used {first_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
        
        # Execute second attack if target still alive
        if second.hp > 0:
            damage = self._calculate_damage(second, first, second_skill)
            first.hp = max(0, first.hp - damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{second.display_name} used {second_skill.display_name} for {damage} damage!")
```

The key changes are:
1. Removed the separate `_check_battle_end()` method
2. Integrated win condition checks directly in the main loop
3. Added proper scene transitions back to MainMenuScene when the battle ends
4. Removed the break statement that was causing the scene to end improperly

This ensures the scene always ends with a proper transition, following the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

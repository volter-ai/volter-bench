Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The test is failing because _quit_whole_game() raises an AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception that isn't being caught in the test. The test is only set up to catch TransitionFromScene exceptions.

The fix is to modify the test to also catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions, since this is an expected way for scenes to end. The test should consider both transitions and game quits as valid ways for the scene to end.

2. Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 5fa0179f-8f43-4eeb-9c29-d0ab589d7869
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for this complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene via transition")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"exiting scene via game quit")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called

                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to access _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause to catch AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added print statement to show when scene exits via game quit

This allows the test to handle both valid ways a scene can end:
- Via _transition_to_scene() (caught by TransitionFromScene)
- Via _quit_whole_game() (caught by AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame)

The test will now pass since it properly handles the game quit exception that occurs when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

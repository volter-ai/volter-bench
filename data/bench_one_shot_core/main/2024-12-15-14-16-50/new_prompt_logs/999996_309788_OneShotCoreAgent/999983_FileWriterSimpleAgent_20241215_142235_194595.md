Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The errors show that the MainGameScene is not properly ending - it's just returning from the run() method instead of explicitly transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. According to the engine architecture, scenes must always end with either:
- _transition_to_scene() to go to another scene
- _quit_whole_game() to end the game

The fix is to modify MainGameScene to properly end the game by calling _quit_whole_game() when the battle ends, rather than just returning. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key changes are:
1. Added _quit_whole_game() calls when:
   - Player has no valid action (all creatures knocked out)
   - Bot has no valid action (all creatures knocked out) 
   - Battle ends (after showing win/loss message)

2. Made sure all exit paths from the run() method go through _quit_whole_game()

This ensures the scene always ends properly according to the engine's requirements, rather than just returning silently.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation carefully:

1. First, I'll create the data models in `models.py`:
- Skill - Has base_damage attribute
- Creature - Has hp, max_hp, attack, defense, speed and a collection of skills
- Player - Has a collection of creatures and inherits from AbstractPlayer

2. Create JSON files in content folder:
- skill.json - Define the "tackle" skill with 3 damage
- creature.json - Define Bubwool and Scizard with their stats and skills
- player.json - Define default player and basic opponent with their creatures

3. Create the scenes:
- MainMenuScene - Allow player to play or quit
- MainGameScene - Handle the battle logic with phases:
  - Player Choice Phase
  - Foe Choice Phase 
  - Resolution Phase
  - Victory/Defeat conditions

4. Update main.py to register both scenes

5. Create tests for both scenes using random mode

Here's the implementation:

This implementation follows all the guidelines and creates a working creature battler game with:
- Proper model inheritance and relationships
- JSON-based prototype system
- Turn-based battle mechanics
- Proper scene transitions
- Random testing for both scenes
- Clean separation of concerns between models, scenes and game logic

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis and Solution:
The error occurs because I added methods (`reset`) to the data models in `models.py`. According to the guidelines, models must be pure data schemas without methods or properties. The reset functionality should be moved to the scene where the game logic belongs.

The fix involves:
1. Remove all methods from models.py classes
2. Move the reset logic to MainGameScene
3. Update the scene to handle resetting creature HP directly

2. Here are the fixed files:

        return False
```

The key changes:
1. Removed all methods from the model classes
2. Added `reset_player_creatures` method to MainGameScene
3. Updated initialization and battle end logic to use the scene's reset method
4. Kept all game logic within the scene

This maintains the separation between data models and game logic while preserving all the functionality.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

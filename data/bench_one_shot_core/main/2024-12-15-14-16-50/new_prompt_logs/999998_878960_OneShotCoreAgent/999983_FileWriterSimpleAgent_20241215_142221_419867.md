Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene isn't properly ending - when the battle ends, it needs to either transition to another scene or quit the game. Looking at the error messages:

1. The first error shows the scene isn't calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`
2. The second error confirms this, showing the scene is just ending without proper termination

The fix is simple: in MainGameScene, when check_battle_end() returns True (meaning the battle is over), we should call `_quit_whole_game()` to properly end the game. This follows the engine's requirements that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

```

The key change is in the `run()` method where we now call `self._quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends. This ensures we properly terminate the game through the engine's mechanisms rather than just letting the scene end naturally.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

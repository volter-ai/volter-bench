## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the missing implementation for random execution order when creatures have the same speed.

1. To fix this issue, we need to modify the `resolve_turn` method in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how we'll implement the solution:

   - We'll compare the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - If the speeds are equal, we'll use Python's `random.choice` to randomly select which creature goes first.
   - We'll then execute the skills in the order determined by either the speed comparison or the random selection.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 227ea4a6-2df5-49df-ac70-b8fbb40f0f97
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                first_attacker, first_skill, first_creature = self.player, player_skill, self.player_creature
                second_attacker, second_skill, second_creature = self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.opponent_creature

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, creature_type):
        weakness_chart = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return weakness_chart.get(skill_type, {}).get(creature_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case when creatures have the same speed by randomly determining which creature goes first. The rest of the battle logic remains unchanged, ensuring that the game follows the architecture documentation while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

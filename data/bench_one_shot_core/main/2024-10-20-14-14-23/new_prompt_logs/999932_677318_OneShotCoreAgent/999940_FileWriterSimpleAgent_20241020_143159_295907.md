## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the two main problems: implementing speed-based turn order and using floats for damage calculations.

1. To fix these issues, I will:

   a) Implement speed-based turn order:
   - Compare the speed of the player's creature and the opponent's creature.
   - Determine the order of actions based on speed, with a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.

   b) Use floats for damage calculations:
   - Change the damage calculation to use floats throughout the process.
   - Only convert to an integer at the final step when applying damage to the creature's HP.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene class, as it handles the battle logic. The models will remain unchanged as they are already correct data schemas.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 22324794-e026-4f63-a036-fa7d2968568d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.reset_battle()

    def reset_battle(self):
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self.battle_ended = True
                break
            self._execute_turn()

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _execute_turn(self):
        player_skill = self._player_choose_skill()
        opponent_skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

        first, second = self._determine_turn_order(

        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _determine_turn_order(self, action1, action2):
        creature1, skill1 = action1
        creature2, skill2 = action2

        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return action1, action2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return action2, action1
        else:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, skill: Skill):
        defender = self.opponent_creature if attacker == self.player_creature else self.player_creature
        
        raw_damage = float(attacker.attack) + float(skill.base_damage) - float(defender.defense)
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It deals {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":

        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This implementation addresses both issues:

1. Speed-based turn order is now implemented in the `_determine_turn_order` method, which compares the speeds of the creatures and uses a random tiebreaker when speeds are equal.

2. Damage calculations now use floats throughout the process, only converting to an integer at the final step when applying damage to the creature's HP.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is in the `MainGameScene` class, specifically in the `determine_order` method. We're trying to use `player_skill` and `opponent_skill` variables that are not defined in this scope. To fix this, we need to modify the `game_loop` and `determine_order` methods to properly handle the skills.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. We'll modify the `game_loop` method to pass the selected skills to the `resolution_phase` method.
2. We'll update the `resolution_phase` method to pass these skills to the `determine_order` method.
3. We'll modify the `determine_order` method to accept and use these skills.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 9aa83666-97a3-4472-9bcb-8f65e15b6d9f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self.game_loop()

    def game_loop(self):
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            # Check for battle end condition
            battle_ended = self.check_battle_end()

        # End the game when the battle is over
        self._quit_whole_game()

    def player_choice_phase(self, player, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self, opponent, creature):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, opponent_skill)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[1], first[2])
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[1], second[2])

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2, skill1, skill2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1, skill1), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2), (self.player, creature1, skill1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1, skill1), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2), (self.player, creature1, skill1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, defender_creature, skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} has been defeated. You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the NameError issues and allow the game to run properly. The main modifications are:

1. In the `game_loop` method, we now pass both `player_skill` and `opponent_skill` to the `resolution_phase` method.
2. The `resolution_phase` method now passes these skills to the `determine_order` method.
3. The `determine_order` method now accepts `skill1` and `skill2` as parameters and uses them when returning the order of actions.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are still pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

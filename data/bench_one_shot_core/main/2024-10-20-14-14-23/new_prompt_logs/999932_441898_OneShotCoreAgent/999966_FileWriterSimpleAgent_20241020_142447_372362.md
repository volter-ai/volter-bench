## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The scene is not transitioning or quitting the game after the battle concludes.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene and transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to check if the battle has ended.
2. In the main game loop, we'll check if the battle has ended after each turn.
3. If the battle has ended, we'll show the result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 166a7ecf-96b7-4933-83fb-f16a6a30afa2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.check_battle_end()

        # Battle has ended, transition back to MainMenuScene
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        
        self.execute_skill(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
```

These changes should resolve the issues by:

1. Properly ending the battle when a creature's HP reaches 0.
2. Transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
3. Ensuring that the scene doesn't terminate without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, as they are already correctly implemented as pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

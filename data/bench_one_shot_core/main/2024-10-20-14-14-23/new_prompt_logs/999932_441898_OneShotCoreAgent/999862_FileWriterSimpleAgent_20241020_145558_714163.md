## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both problems in the `MainGameScene` class. Here's how I plan to fix them:

1. Implement the 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase:
   - Add a 'Back' button to the attack and swap choices.
   - Implement a loop in the player_choice_phase method to allow returning to the main choice when 'Back' is selected.

2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene:
   - Add a method to reset creature states.
   - Call this method in the check_battle_end method before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

Now, I'll rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 82c1d7ae-5c9d-49a7-8709-e296ceedad0b

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address both issues:

1. The 'Back' option is now implemented in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods. If the player selects 'Back', the method returns `None`, which causes the `player_choice_phase` to loop back to the main choice.

2. A new `reset_creature_states` method has been added to reset the HP of all creatures to their maximum values. This method is called in the `check_battle_end` method before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

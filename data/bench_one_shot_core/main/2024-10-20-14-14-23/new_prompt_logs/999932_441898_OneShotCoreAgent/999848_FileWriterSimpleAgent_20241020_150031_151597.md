## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures of a player are either knocked out (hp = 0) or the active creature is the only one with hp > 0.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap to. If not, we'll return None.
2. In the `player_choice_phase` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns None by forcing the player to choose an attack instead.
3. We'll also add a check in the `resolution_phase` to handle None actions, which will effectively skip the turn for that player.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 47f767a2-aa56-482d-b634-74711b71ecd4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issue by ensuring that `_wait_for_choice` is never called with an empty list of choices. If there are no creatures available to swap, the player will be forced to choose an attack instead. This solution maintains the game's logic and structure while preventing the error from occurring.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

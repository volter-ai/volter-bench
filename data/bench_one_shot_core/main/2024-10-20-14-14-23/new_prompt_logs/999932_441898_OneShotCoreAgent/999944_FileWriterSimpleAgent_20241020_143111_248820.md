## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes:

1. Modify the damage calculation in the MainGameScene to use floats instead of integers until the final step.
2. Remove the maximum turn counter implementation, as it's not specified in the architecture documents.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 3139dfb5-dd99-4926-8f9e-ed9965fc1752
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}, Speed: {self.player_creature.speed})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}, Speed: {self.opponent_creature.speed})

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

            player_skill = self._player_choose_skill()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_choose_skill()

            self._resolve_turn(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def _player_choose_skill(self) -> Skill:
        self._show_text(self.player, "Your turn to choose a skill!")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _opponent_choose_skill(self) -> Skill:
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolve_turn(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            if not self._check_battle_end():
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly decide who goes first
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
                if not self._check_battle_end():
                    self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            else:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
                if not self._check_battle_end():
                    self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It deals {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water":
            return 2.0
        elif skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf":
            return 0.5
        elif skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire":
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1.0

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

The changes made to address the issues are:

1. In the `_execute_skill` method, the `raw_damage` calculation now uses `float()` to ensure floating-point arithmetic is used throughout the damage calculation process. The final damage is still converted to an integer at the end, as specified in the architecture documents.

2. The maximum turn counter and related logic have been removed, as they were not specified in the architecture documents.

These changes align the implementation more closely with the architecture documents while maintaining the core functionality of the battle system.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

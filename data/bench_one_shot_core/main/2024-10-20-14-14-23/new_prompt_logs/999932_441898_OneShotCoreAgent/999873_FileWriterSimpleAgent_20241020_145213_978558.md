## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA report, we need to make two main changes to the `MainGameScene` class:

1. Implement speed-based execution logic during the resolution phase.
2. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to collect actions from both players before executing them.
2. We'll create a new `execute_turn` method that will sort the actions based on the creatures' speed and execute them in the correct order.
3. We'll add a `reset_creatures` method to reset the state of all creatures when leaving the scene.
4. We'll call `reset_creatures` in the `handle_battle_end` method before transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: c1e37348-501f-4fc7-ad74-c84d3bafd3ae
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. Speed-based execution logic is now implemented in the `execute_turn` method. Actions are sorted based on whether they're swap actions (which always go first) and then by the speed of the active creatures.

2. The `reset_creatures` method has been added to reset the state of all creatures when leaving the scene. This method is called in the `handle_battle_end` method before transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

These modifications ensure that the turn order is determined by the creatures' speed and that the creatures' state is properly reset when leaving the battle scene. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the architecture of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

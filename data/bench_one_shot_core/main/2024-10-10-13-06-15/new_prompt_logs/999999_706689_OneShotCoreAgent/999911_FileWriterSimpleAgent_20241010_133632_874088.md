## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly between scenes.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will ensure that the scene exits properly and follows the expected flow.

2. We'll modify the run method of the MainGameScene to include a loop that allows for multiple battles and proper scene transitions.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 9d5d4d25-2219-495b-963f-3528b5d87a77
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
            
            battle_result = self.battle()
            
            if battle_result == "win":
                self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            else:
                self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

            self.reset_creatures()

            play_again = Button("Play Again")
            main_menu = Button("Return to Main Menu")
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, main_menu])

            if choice == main_menu:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return
            # If play_again is chosen, the loop continues

    def battle(self):
        while True:

            # Foe Choice Phase
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

                return "lose"
            elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
                return "win"

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Implementing a main game loop in the `run` method that allows for multiple battles and proper scene transitions.
2. Adding an option to return to the main menu after each battle, which ensures that the scene exits properly.
3. Separating the battle logic into its own method for better organization and readability.
4. Ensuring that the scene always exits through either a transition to another scene or by returning from the `run` method.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene will now properly exit after each battle, giving the player the option to play again or return to the main menu. This approach follows the engine's architecture and maintains the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

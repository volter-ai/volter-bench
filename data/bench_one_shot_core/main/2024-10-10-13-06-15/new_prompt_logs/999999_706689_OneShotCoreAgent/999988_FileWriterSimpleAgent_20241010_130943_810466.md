## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The scene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will show the result and then transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop continues until a transition or quit occurs.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 3f164867-934c-4167-9e37-edb5d8dc11d0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self.check_battle_end()

        self.end_battle()

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        
        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {foe_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - foe_skill.damage)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.battle_ended = True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.battle_ended = True

    def end_battle(self):
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended. Returning to the main menu.")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to control the main game loop.
2. Ensuring the game loop continues until the battle ends.
3. Adding an `end_battle` method that resets the creatures, shows a message, and transitions back to the MainMenuScene.
4. Using `_transition_to_scene` to properly exit the MainGameScene and return to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the scene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game when appropriate.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

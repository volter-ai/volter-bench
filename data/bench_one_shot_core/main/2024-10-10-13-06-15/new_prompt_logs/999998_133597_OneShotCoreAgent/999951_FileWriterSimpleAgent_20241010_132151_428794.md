## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is not transitioning to another scene or quitting the game after the battle concludes. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the run method to include a loop that continues the battle until it ends.
2. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll also add an option for the player to quit the game after the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7e2553ee-0c56-4e74-a06d-3624916d0437
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene properly exits either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game. The main changes are:

1. The `run` method now includes a loop that continues the battle until it ends.
2. After the battle ends, we call the new `_post_battle_menu` method.
3. The `_post_battle_menu` method gives the player the option to play again (transition to MainMenuScene) or quit the game.

These changes ensure that the scene always exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game, which should resolve the test failures we were seeing.

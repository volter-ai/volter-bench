## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to call the `reset_creatures` method after the battle ends and before transitioning to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that the state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of the scene, as required.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. We'll modify the `run` method in the MainGameScene to call `reset_creatures` after the battle loop and before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.
2. We'll keep the `reset_creatures` method as is, since it's already correctly implemented.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture and model guidelines. The `Player` and `Creature` models remain pure data schemas without methods or properties, as required.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 211088ce-d40c-42f2-8615-b6d0b06c6fa4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result()
        self.reset_creatures()  # Reset creatures before transitioning
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.foe_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self.foe_creature.hp = max(0, self.foe_creature.hp)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.foe_creature.hp == 0

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by calling `reset_creatures()` after the battle ends and before transitioning to the MainMenuScene. This ensures that the state of the player's creatures is properly reset when transitioning out of the scene, as required by the QA test.

The rest of the implementation remains the same, maintaining the correct structure and functionality of the MainGameScene while adhering to the engine's capabilities and the project's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

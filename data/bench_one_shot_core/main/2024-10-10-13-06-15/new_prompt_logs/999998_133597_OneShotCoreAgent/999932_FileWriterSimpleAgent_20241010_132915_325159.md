## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the MainGameScene:

1. Modify the resolution phase to handle the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first.
2. Update the weakness factor calculation to explicitly handle the 'Normal' type as being neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 7b94b6d5-fc3e-40b7-ad3c-1bd627627e4d

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

    def end_battle(self, message):

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA report:

1. The `resolve_turn` method now handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first using `random.choice([True, False])`.

2. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'Normal' type by returning a factor of 1 (neither effective nor ineffective) when the skill type is 'normal'.

These modifications ensure that the implementation aligns with the described architecture and game mechanics while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

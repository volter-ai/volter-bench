## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I apologize for missing this requirement in the initial implementation. Let's address this issue:

1. To fix the issue of not implementing the random decision for equal speed in skill execution order, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use Python's `random.choice` to determine which creature goes first in that case.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. Import the `random` module at the top of the file.
2. In the `resolution_phase` method, we'll add a condition to check if the speeds are equal.
3. If speeds are equal, we'll use `random.choice` to decide which creature goes first.
4. We'll then execute the skills based on this random choice.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and doesn't require any changes to the models. It only affects the game logic in the `MainGameScene`.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(attacker, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str) -> float:
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")

    def return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where both creatures have equal speed by randomly choosing which one goes first. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, and we haven't modified any models or exceeded the engine's capabilities. This should resolve the issue raised during QA/testing.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

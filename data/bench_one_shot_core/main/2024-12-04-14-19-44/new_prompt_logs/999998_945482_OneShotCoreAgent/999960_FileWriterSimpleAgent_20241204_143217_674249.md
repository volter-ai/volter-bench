Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not catching the _QuitWholeGame exception that gets raised when the game ends. According to the engine's design, this exception is expected and should be caught.

Looking at the test code, we need to:
1. Add _QuitWholeGame to the exceptions we catch in the try block
2. Add appropriate handling for when the game quits
3. Keep the existing RandomModeGracefulExit handling

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 336642ea-9967-4a88-a909-7b29984e5a86
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        app = App()
        app.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)
        return app

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting scene so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

The key changes are:
1. Added import for AbstractApp to get access to _QuitWholeGame
2. Added except clause for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame
3. Added appropriate print message for when the game quits

This maintains all the architectural requirements while properly handling the expected game termination exception. The test will now pass since it properly catches and handles all the ways the scene can end:
- Transitioning to another scene
- Random mode ending
- Game quitting

The rest of the implementation (models, scenes, etc.) remains unchanged as they were working correctly. The issue was just in how the test handled the game quitting.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

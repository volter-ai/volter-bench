Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error is `NameError: name 'Player' is not defined` in main.py. This is happening because we need to import the Player model from models.py into main.py.

The fix is simple - we just need to add the import statement in main.py to import the Player class from our models module.

2. Here's the fixed main.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 37aacc80-539f-4bd3-9922-5aefc2daffad
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player
import uuid

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id("default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("player1"))
```

The only change needed was adding the import statement:
# Excerpt ID: 72d687d7-853d-4504-9e4c-d56553c3830b
```python
from main_game.models import Player
```

This follows all the guidelines since:
1. We're still using the Player model that inherits from AbstractPlayer
2. The models remain pure data schemas
3. We're properly importing and using the model in the main application file

The error occurred simply because we were trying to use the Player class without importing it first. This fix maintains the architecture while resolving the NameError.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

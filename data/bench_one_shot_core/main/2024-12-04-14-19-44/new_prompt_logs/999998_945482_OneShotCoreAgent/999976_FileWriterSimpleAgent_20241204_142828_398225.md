Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix the issue. The error occurs because I added a `reset()` method to the Creature model, but models must be pure data schemas without methods.

1. Solution description:
- Remove the `reset()` method from Creature model
- Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
- Instead of calling `creature.reset()`, we'll directly set the hp back to max_hp in the scene
- This maintains pure data models while keeping the same functionality

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 99e3fbf5-1a5e-44d1-99e9-64df2f270c6e
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
```

And in the MainGameScene, we'll replace the reset calls with direct hp assignment:

# Excerpt ID: dc79525c-b0b9-4136-8ecf-ee301aff8ca2
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
# ... rest of imports and code same as before ...

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player choice phase
            player_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Opponent choice phase
            opponent_skill = self._get_skill_choice(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

            # Resolution phase
            first, second = self._determine_order(
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill)
            )

            # Execute skills in order
            self._execute_skill(*first)
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            if self.player_creature.hp > 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(*second)
                if self._check_battle_end():
                    break

        # Reset creatures before leaving by setting hp back to max_hp
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    # ... rest of the scene code remains the same ...
```

This change:
1. Maintains pure data models without methods
2. Keeps the reset functionality in the scene where game logic belongs
3. Follows the engine's architecture requirements
4. Preserves the same game behavior

The error should now be resolved since we've removed all methods from the data models.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

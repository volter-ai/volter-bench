Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is that the MainGameScene is ending without properly transitioning or quitting. According to the error message and engine requirements, a scene must always either:
1. Transition to another scene using `_transition_to_scene()`, or 
2. End the game using `_quit_whole_game()`

In our case, when the battle ends (win or loss), we're just returning from the run() method instead of properly ending the game. We should call `_quit_whole_game()` when the battle ends.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `self._quit_whole_game()` calls before returning in the run() method when:
   - A player has no valid action (no creatures left)
   - The battle ends (check_battle_end returns True)

This ensures we properly end the game through the engine's mechanisms rather than just returning from the scene. This follows the engine's requirements that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

The rest of the implementation remains unchanged as it was working correctly. The models are still pure data schemas and all the game logic remains in the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

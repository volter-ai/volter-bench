Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the test_main_game_scene.py file. The test is failing because we're not properly handling the GracefulExit exception that occurs when the game quits. The test should catch both RandomModeGracefulExit and AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exceptions.

The test is also not properly isolated - it's actually running through the whole game flow including scene transitions, which is causing the stack to grow until it eventually hits quit. Instead, we should patch the transition method for testing the MainGameScene in isolation.

Here's the fixed test file:

# Excerpt ID: 20f3da02-8f53-434f-a098-75701fbd8224
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch

from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, RandomModeGracefulExit, AbstractApp
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.main import App

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            # Patch transition_to_scene to prevent actual scene transitions during test
            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
                try:
                    scene.run()
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"Random mode counter reached 0, ending run {i}")
                except AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame:
                    print(f"Game quit gracefully, ending run {i}")
                
                # Verify that the scene attempted to transition when battle ended
                assert mock_transition.called, "Scene should attempt to transition after battle"
                assert mock_transition.call_args[0][0] == "MainMenuScene", "Should transition to MainMenuScene"
```

The key changes are:

1. Added patch for _transition_to_scene to prevent actual scene transitions
2. Added handling for AbstractApp._QuitWholeGame exception
3. Added assertions to verify the scene attempted correct transition
4. Isolated the MainGameScene test from actual scene transitions

This keeps the test focused on just the MainGameScene behavior while properly handling all expected exceptions from the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

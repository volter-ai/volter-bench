Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Analysis of the issue:
The error occurs because MainGameScene terminates without properly ending the game. When a battle ends (win or loss), it just returns from the run() method instead of explicitly calling quit_whole_game(). According to the engine's requirements, scenes must always explicitly transition to another scene or quit the game.

Solution:
- When a battle ends (either player wins or loses), we should call _quit_whole_game() instead of just returning
- This needs to be done in the _check_battle_end() method of MainGameScene
- No changes to models are needed since this is purely a scene flow issue

2. Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

            return True
            
        return False
```

The key change is in the run() method and _check_battle_end() flow. Now when a battle ends, instead of just returning, we properly call _quit_whole_game() to signal the end of the game to the engine. This follows the engine's requirement that scenes must explicitly transition or quit.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

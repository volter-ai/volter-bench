Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix this issue.

1. Description of fix:
The error occurs because we're still trying to call `reset()` on creatures in MainGameScene, but we removed that method from the Creature model (since models must be pure data schemas). We need to modify MainGameScene.py to directly set the hp values instead of calling reset().

The fix is to replace:
# Excerpt ID: 63294b5e-78f0-4a55-b0e8-4bb5a691d3ad
```python
self.player_creature.reset()
self.opponent_creature.reset()
```
with:
# Excerpt ID: ab57cadb-bd39-40f9-bb4c-1e8aaf9a2650
```python
self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

2. Here's the complete fixed MainGameScene file:

# Excerpt ID: d5985fc3-29c6-4485-95db-aafe59e55df3
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, DictionaryChoice

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""=== Battle ===

    def _determine_order(self, action1, action2):

        # Show result
        self._show_text(self.player, 
            f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!\n"
            f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender_creature.display_name}")
        
        # Check if battle is over

            winner = "You" if defender == self.opponent else "Opponent"
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner} won the battle!")
            return False
            
        return True

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1.0
            
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2.0, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2.0, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2.0, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1.0)
```

This change maintains the pure data model requirement by keeping all logic in the scene and treating models as pure data schemas. The functionality remains the same, we just directly set the hp values instead of using a method call.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

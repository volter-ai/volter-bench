Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help fix this issue. 

1. The problem is that the Creature class in models.py has a `reset` method, but models must be pure data schemas without any methods. The error message specifically states: "Creature is a pure data model and methods like reset cannot be added to it. All logic should be implemented in scenes"

The solution is to:
1. Remove the reset method from the Creature model
2. Move the reset logic to the MainGameScene where it belongs
3. Simply set hp = max_hp directly in the scene when needed

Here's the fixed models.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 4946269d-5c0f-4289-8355-42dbb74299ae
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Collection

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool 
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: Collection[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: Collection[Creature]
```

And in main_game_scene.py, we'll need to modify the end of battle to directly set hp = max_hp instead of calling reset(). That part would look like:

# Excerpt ID: 48a0a656-334b-4cbc-beee-bd44ba310793
```python
        # Reset creatures before leaving
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This change maintains the pure data model requirement while keeping the same functionality, just moved to where the logic belongs - in the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

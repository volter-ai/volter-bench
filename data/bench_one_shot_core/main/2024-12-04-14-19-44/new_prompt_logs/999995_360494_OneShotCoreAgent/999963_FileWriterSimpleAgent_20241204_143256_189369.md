Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll fix two issues in the MainGameScene:

1. Add "Back" functionality in the Player Choice Phase:
- When showing skills or swap choices, include a "Back" button
- If "Back" is chosen, return to the main action choice (Attack/Swap)

2. Handle equal speed randomly:
- When creatures have equal speed, use random.choice to determine order
- This maintains fairness in speed ties

Here's the complete fixed implementation:

```

Key changes:
1. Added "Back" functionality:
   - Made get_player_action use a while loop to allow returning to main menu
   - Added Back button to both skills and creature selection
   - Added Back button info to __str__

2. Added random speed tie resolution:
   - Created get_speed_key function that uses both speed and random value
   - This ensures random order when speeds are equal
   - Uses random.random() as secondary sort key

The changes maintain the engine's patterns and keep all game logic in the scene while using the models as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
The issue is in the MainGameScene where we're trying to show swap choices when there are no valid creatures to swap to. This can happen when:
1. All other creatures are knocked out (hp = 0)
2. The player only has one creature left

We need to handle this case by not offering the "Swap" choice when there are no valid creatures to swap to.

Here's the fixed MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 25c4f633-af5d-4048-88f5-748cbd818bbf
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

from main_game.models import Creature

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        
        # Initialize creatures
        for p in [self.player, self.bot]:
            for c in p.creatures:
                c.hp = c.max_hp
            p.active_creature = p.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        p_creature = self.player.active_creature
        b_creature = self.bot.active_creature
        
        return f"""=== Battle ===

            if all(c.hp == 0 for c in p.creatures):

        return False
```

The key changes are:
1. Check for available creatures before offering the "Swap" choice
2. Only show swap option if there are valid creatures to swap to
3. Updated the scene's __str__ to indicate swap is conditional

This ensures we never try to offer an empty list of choices to the player, which was causing the test failures. The fix stays within the engine's capabilities and maintains the proper separation between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The 'Field' object has no attribute 'display_name' in the MainGameScene.
2. The `_wait_for_choice` method is being called with no choices in the MainGameScene.

These issues suggest that we need to modify the MainGameScene class to properly initialize and handle the player and opponent creatures. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll ensure that the active_creature for both the player and opponent is properly initialized in the MainGameScene constructor.
2. We'll add a check in the choose_swap method to handle the case when there are no available creatures to swap to.

Let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: bff4118a-79b1-4b58-9581-c927d0e3b18f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        swap_button = Button("Swap")
        choices = [attack_button, swap_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)

        if attack_button == choice:
            return self.choose_attack(current_player)
        elif swap_button == choice:

        for current_player, action in actions:
            if action[0] == "swap":
                self.perform_swap(current_player, action[1])

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker.active_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}

    def check_battle_end(self):

                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return True
        return False
```

These changes address the two main issues:

1. The 'Field' object attribute error is resolved by properly initializing `active_creature` for both the player and opponent in the constructor.
2. The `choose_swap` method now checks if there are available creatures to swap to. If there are no creatures available, it shows a message to the player and defaults to choosing an attack instead.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the game's logic and adhering to the engine's architecture. The models remain as pure data schemas, and we've stayed within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to address the 'Field' object having no attribute 'display_name' error. This error is occurring in the `__str__` method of the MainGameScene class when trying to access the `display_name` of the opponent's active creature.

The root cause of this issue is likely that the `active_creature` field in the Player model is not properly initialized or typed. To fix this, we need to:

1. Ensure that the Player model in `models.py` correctly defines the `active_creature` field.
2. Properly initialize the `active_creature` for both the player and the opponent in the MainGameScene constructor.

Here's how we'll fix this issue:

1. First, we'll update the `models.py` file to ensure the Player model has the correct fields.
2. Then, we'll modify the `main_game_scene.py` file to properly initialize the active creatures.

Let's start by rewriting the `models.py` file:

# Excerpt ID: 0d9c3e4d-a4c8-4913-9828-61d71b8cf295
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature]
    active_creature: Creature = None
```

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file to properly initialize the active creatures:

# Excerpt ID: 68a39d7c-3ac3-4105-a618-3fbdae85647f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.initialize_active_creatures()

    def initialize_active_creatures(self):
        if not self.player.active_creature:
            self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        if not self.opponent.active_creature:
            self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
Turn: {self.turn_counter}

{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player.active_creature.display_name}
HP: {self.player.active_creature.hp}/{self.player.active_creature.max_hp}

{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent.active_creature.display_name}
HP: {self.opponent.active_creature.hp}/{self.opponent.active_creature.max_hp}

            self.turn_counter += 1
            player_action = self.player_turn(self.player)
            opponent_action = self.player_turn(self.opponent)
            self.resolve_turn(player_action, opponent_action)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_turn(self, current_player):
        attack_button = Button("Attack")
        swap_button = Button("Swap")
        choices = [attack_button, swap_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)

        if attack_button == choice:
            return self.choose_attack(current_player)

            (self.player, player_action),

        ]
        actions.sort(key=lambda x: x[0].active_creature.speed, reverse=True)

        for current_player, action in actions:
            if action[0] == "swap":
                self.perform_swap(current_player, action[1])
            elif action[0] == "attack":

    def perform_swap(self, current_player, new_creature):

        defender = self.player if attacker == self.opponent else self.opponent
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker.active_creature, defender.active_creature, skill)
        defender.active_creature.hp = max(0, defender.active_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker.active_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(type_factor * raw_damage)
        return max(1, final_damage)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        for current_player in [self.player, self.opponent]:
            if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in current_player.creatures):

                self._show_text(self.player, f"{winner.display_name} wins the battle!")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the 'Field' object attribute error by:

1. Properly defining the `active_creature` field in the Player model.
2. Adding an `initialize_active_creatures` method in the MainGameScene class to ensure that both the player and opponent have their active creatures set.
3. Calling `initialize_active_creatures` in the MainGameScene constructor.

These modifications adhere to the engine's architecture and capabilities, keeping the models as pure data schemas and implementing the game logic within the scene classes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

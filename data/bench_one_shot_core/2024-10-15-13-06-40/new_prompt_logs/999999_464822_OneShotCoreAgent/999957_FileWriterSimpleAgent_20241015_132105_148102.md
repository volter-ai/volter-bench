## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem of handling creatures with the same speed in the MainGameScene.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the resolution_phase method in the MainGameScene class. We'll add a check to see if the player's creature and the opponent's creature have the same speed. If they do, we'll use Python's random.choice function to randomly determine which creature goes first. This aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine, as it doesn't require any changes to the models or the engine itself.

2. Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: bd35ee52-807a-44c8-93d5-4fa6b7df61c7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.end_battle()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self.execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            # If speeds are equal, randomly choose who goes first
            first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill)
            ])
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Both creatures have the same speed! {first_attacker.display_name}'s {first_creature.display_name} will attack first!")
            self.execute_skill(first_attacker, first_creature, first_skill, second_creature)
            if second_creature.hp > 0:
                self.execute_skill(second_attacker, second_creature, second_skill, first_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        damage = max(damage, 1)  # Ensure at least 1 damage is dealt
        defender_creature.hp = max(defender_creature.hp - damage, 0)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            result = "You lost the battle!"
        else:
            result = "You won the battle!"
        self._show_text(self.player, result)
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case where creatures have the same speed by randomly determining which creature attacks first. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged, and it still adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

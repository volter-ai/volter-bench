## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the whole game.
2. The test for MainGameScene is failing because the scene is not exiting as expected.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a call to `_quit_whole_game()` if the player chooses to quit from the MainMenuScene.

These changes will ensure that the game flow is complete and that the scene exits properly, satisfying the test conditions.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 53ca3894-a3c5-4ff5-941a-7df206863c4a

        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent.active_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def run(self):
        while True:

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def resolve_turn(self, player_action, opponent_action):
        actions = [

            elif action_type == "attack":
                damage = self.calculate_damage(current_player.active_creature, other_player.active_creature, action_target)
                other_player.active_creature.hp = max(0, other_player.active_creature.hp - damage)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def handle_fainted_creature(self, player):
        self._show_text(player, f"{player.active_creature.display_name} fainted!")
        available_creatures = [creature for creature in player.creatures if creature.hp > 0]
        if available_creatures:
            creature_choices = [SelectThing(creature) for creature in available_creatures]

            player.active_creature = new_creature

    def check_battle_end(self):

            return True
        elif all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in self.opponent.creatures):
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

Now, let's update the `main_menu_scene.py` file to include the option to quit the game:

# Excerpt ID: d3c818f7-7978-46f0-bac8-a545b66fd1c5
```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Main Menu===
Welcome to Creature Battler!

> Play
> Quit
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            play_button = Button("Play")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [play_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if choice == play_button:
                self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
            elif choice == quit_button:
                self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The MainGameScene transitions back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.
2. The MainMenuScene provides an option to quit the game, which calls `_quit_whole_game()`.

These modifications should resolve the issues raised during QA/testing, allowing the game to exit properly and satisfying the test conditions. The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between models and game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

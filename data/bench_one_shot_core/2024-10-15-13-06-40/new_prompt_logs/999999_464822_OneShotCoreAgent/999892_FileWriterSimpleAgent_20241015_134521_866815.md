## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the situation where `_wait_for_choice` is being called with no choices. This is happening in the `choose_swap` method of the `MainGameScene` class. The problem occurs when all creatures of a player are either fainted or already active, leaving no available creatures to swap.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `choose_swap` method, we'll check if there are any available creatures to swap. If not, we'll return None instead of calling `_wait_for_choice`.
2. In the `player_turn` method, we'll handle the case where `choose_swap` returns None by defaulting to the "Attack" action.
3. We'll also add a check in the `run` method to end the battle if a player has no more creatures able to battle.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]

            return True
        return False
```

These changes should resolve the issue by:
1. Handling the case where no creatures are available to swap.
2. Ensuring that the battle ends when a player has no more creatures able to battle.
3. Preventing `_wait_for_choice` from being called with an empty list of choices.

The overall structure and logic of the game remain intact, and we're still working within the capabilities of the engine. The models haven't been modified, maintaining their role as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

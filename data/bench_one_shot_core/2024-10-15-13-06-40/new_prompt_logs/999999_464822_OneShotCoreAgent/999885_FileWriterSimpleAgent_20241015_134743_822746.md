## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. Here's how I plan to fix these problems:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase for both Attack and Swap choices.
2. Implement random order resolution for creatures with the same speed.
3. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the MainGameScene.

These changes will be implemented in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. The 'Back' option is now available in both the Attack and Swap choice phases.
2. The resolution phase now handles random order for creatures with the same speed by using a tuple key for sorting that includes a random value.
3. A new method `reset_creatures_state()` is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, which resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum values.

The changes stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The `models.py` file remains unchanged, preserving the pure data schema nature of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

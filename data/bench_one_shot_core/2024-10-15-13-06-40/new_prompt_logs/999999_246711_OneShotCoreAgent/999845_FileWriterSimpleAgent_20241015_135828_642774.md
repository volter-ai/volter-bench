## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. To address these problems, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how we'll fix each issue:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player Choice Phase.
2. Implement random tie-breaking for skill execution order.
3. Add forced swapping when a creature is knocked out.
4. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene.

These changes will be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and without modifying the models.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

This updated `MainGameScene` class addresses all the issues raised:

1. Added a 'Back' option in both the `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods, allowing players to return to the main choice.
2. Implemented random tie-breaking for skill execution order by shuffling the actions list before sorting by speed.
3. Added forced swapping when a creature is knocked out in the `check_knockout` method.
4. Reset the state of the player's creatures when leaving the scene in the `reset_creatures_state` method.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither _transition_to_scene nor _quit_whole_game is called.

2. The whole game flow test is failing because the MainGameScene is not transitioning or quitting properly.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly exit the scene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll do it:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. We'll modify the _check_battle_end method to return to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the game loop in the run method continues until the battle ends.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: e49be8ca-4669-4438-95a6-12d7df4ec50b
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.current_turn = "player"

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Current Turn: {self.current_turn.capitalize()}

Available Skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills if self.current_turn == "player" else self.opponent_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle Start!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Battle Start!")
        
        while True:
            if self.current_turn == "player":
                self._player_turn()
            else:
                self._opponent_turn()
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break
            
            self.current_turn = "opponent" if self.current_turn == "player" else "player"

        self._reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _player_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self._resolve_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, selected_skill)

    def _opponent_turn(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        selected_skill = next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        self._resolve_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, selected_skill)

    def _resolve_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        weakness_factor = self._calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes should address the issues raised during QA/testing:

1. The MainGameScene now properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We've added a _reset_creatures method to restore the creatures' HP after each battle.
3. The run method now includes a loop that continues until the battle ends, ensuring that all game logic is executed.

These modifications should resolve the test failures while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, preserving their status as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

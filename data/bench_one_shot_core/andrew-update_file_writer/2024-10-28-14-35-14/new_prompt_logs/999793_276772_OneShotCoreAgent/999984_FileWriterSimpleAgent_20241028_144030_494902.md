Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I understand the issues and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Random decision for execution order when speeds are equal:
   I'll modify the _resolution_phase method to include a random decision when the speeds of the player's creature and the opponent's creature are equal.

2. Using floats for damage calculations:
   I'll update the _execute_skill method to use floats for all damage calculations, only converting to an integer at the final step when applying damage to the creature's HP.

These changes will be implemented in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 1966e338-96b1-4fd3-92ce-9e6f6e7728d0

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The `_resolution_phase` method now includes a random decision when the speeds of the creatures are equal, using `random.choice([True, False])` to determine the order of skill execution.

2. The `_execute_skill` method now uses floats for all damage calculations. The `raw_damage` and `final_damage` variables are now calculated using floats, and the conversion to an integer only happens at the final step when applying the damage to the creature's HP.

3. The `_get_weakness_factor` method now returns float values instead of integers to maintain precision in calculations.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA feedback while adhering to the specified architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The changes do not affect the models, keeping them as pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

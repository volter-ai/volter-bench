Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The scene is not handling the end of the game correctly, which is causing the FixableException in the whole game test.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll modify the _check_battle_end method to use this new method instead of just showing text.
3. We'll ensure that the run method continues the game loop until the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: c8324883-ce9e-459e-94ad-f7ca8bed5928
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end

                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):

        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,

        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle("You won the battle!")

        return False

    def _end_battle(self, message):
        self._show_text(self.player, message)

        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, quit_game])
        
        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses both issues:

1. The `_check_battle_end` method now calls `_end_battle` when the battle is over, which properly handles the end of the game by either transitioning back to the main menu or quitting the game.

2. The `run` method continues the game loop until the battle ends, ensuring that the scene doesn't terminate prematurely.

3. The new `_end_battle` method gives the player a choice to play again or quit the game, properly ending the scene with either a transition or by quitting the whole game.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flows correctly from start to finish, adhering to the engine's requirements for scene transitions and game termination.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

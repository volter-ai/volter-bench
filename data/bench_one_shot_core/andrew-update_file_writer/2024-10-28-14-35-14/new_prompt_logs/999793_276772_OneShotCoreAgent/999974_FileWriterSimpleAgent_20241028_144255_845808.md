Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You're right, and I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method to the Player model, which violates the pure data schema requirement. Let's fix this issue by removing the class method and keeping the models as pure data schemas.

1. To fix this issue, we'll do the following:
   - Remove the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player class in `models.py`.
   - Keep all models as pure data schemas without any methods or properties.
   - Move the logic for creating Player and Creature objects to the `App` class in `main.py`.

2. Here's the rewritten `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 2b9ffd9f-75a5-4ec3-98ef-7fff15e005b6
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, let's update the `main.py` file to handle the creation of Player and Creature objects:

# Excerpt ID: f41f4bdc-0a2c-4c1f-a012-d1c1292a3753
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player, Creature

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player_data = Player.get_data().get("prototypes")["default_player"]
        player = Player(
            uid=player_id,
            display_name=player_data["display_name"],
            description=player_data["description"],
            prototype_id="default_player",
            creatures=[self.create_creature(creature_id) for creature_id in player_data["creatures"]]
        )
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot_data = Player.get_data().get("prototypes")[prototype_id]
        bot = Player(
            uid=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            display_name=bot_data["display_name"],
            description=bot_data["description"],
            prototype_id=prototype_id,
            creatures=[self.create_creature(creature_id) for creature_id in bot_data["creatures"]]
        )
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot

    def create_creature(self, creature_id: str):
        return create_from_game_database(creature_id, Creature)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes address the issue by:
1. Keeping the models in `models.py` as pure data schemas without any methods.
2. Moving the logic for creating Player and Creature objects to the `App` class in `main.py`.
3. Using the `create_from_game_database` function to create Creature objects, which adheres to the engine's capabilities.

This solution maintains the architecture of the game and stays within the capabilities of the engine while fixing the AttributeError that was raised during testing.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

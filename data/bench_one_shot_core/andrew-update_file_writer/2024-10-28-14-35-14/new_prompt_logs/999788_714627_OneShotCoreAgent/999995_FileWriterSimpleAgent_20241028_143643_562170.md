Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition to another scene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a new method `_end_battle` that will handle the end of the battle, showing the result and then transitioning to the appropriate scene or quitting the game.

3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and if so, who won.

4. In the `run` method, we'll use the result from `_check_battle_end` to call `_end_battle` when appropriate.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)

            if battle_result is not None:
                self._end_battle(battle_result)
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
        else:
            self._execute_skill(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, foe_skill, self.player, self.player_creature)
            if self.player_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            return False  # Player lost
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True  # Player won
        return None  # Battle continues

    def _end_battle(self, player_won: bool):
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
        
        # Here you can add logic to transition to another scene or quit the game
        # For example, transition back to the main menu:
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        # Or quit the whole game:
        # self._quit_whole_game()
```

This implementation ensures that the MainGameScene always exits properly by either transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The `_end_battle` method is called when the battle ends, and it handles showing the result and transitioning to the appropriate next scene. 

By transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, we ensure that the game loop continues and the scene doesn't terminate unexpectedly. If you want the game to end after a single battle, you could replace the `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")` line with `self._quit_whole_game()`.

This should resolve the issue and make the tests pass, as the scene will now always exit in an expected manner.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

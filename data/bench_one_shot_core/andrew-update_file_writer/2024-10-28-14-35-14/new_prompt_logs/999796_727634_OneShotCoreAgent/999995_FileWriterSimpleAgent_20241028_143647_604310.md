Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. This is causing the tests to fail because the scene is not exiting properly. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.

2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends, to prepare for potential future battles.

3. We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the player won or lost, which we'll use to determine the next action.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 9b43771a-50dd-43e0-bbe5-5a000d943727
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            battle_result = self.check_battle_end()
            if battle_result is not None:
                self.reset_creatures()
                if battle_result:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle! Returning to main menu.")
                    self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                else:
                    self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle! Game over.")
                    self._quit_whole_game()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool | None:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return False
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return None

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issue by ensuring that the MainGameScene always exits properly, either by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene or by quitting the game. The `check_battle_end` method now returns a boolean indicating the battle result, which is used to determine the next action. 

The `reset_creatures` method is added to restore the creatures' HP after each battle, preparing them for potential future battles. This maintains the game state consistency and allows for multiple battles if needed.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected, adhering to the engine's requirements and maintaining the existing architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

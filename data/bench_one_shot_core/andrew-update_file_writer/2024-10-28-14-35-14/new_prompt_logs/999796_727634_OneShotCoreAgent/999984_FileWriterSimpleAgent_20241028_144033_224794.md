Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both problems in the MainGameScene. Here's how I plan to fix them:

1. Random decision for execution order when creature speeds are equal:
   I'll modify the _resolution_phase method to include a random decision when the speeds are equal.

2. "Leaf" type relationships in the _get_weakness_factor method:
   I'll update the effectiveness dictionary in the _get_weakness_factor method to include all the "Leaf" type relationships.

Now, I'll rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 5c4ba1a3-e165-4dc7-8ee8-6ad4e6e71906
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. In the `_resolution_phase` method, I've added a random decision when the speeds are equal using `random.choice([True, False])`.

2. In the `_get_weakness_factor` method, I've updated the `effectiveness` dictionary to include all type relationships, including those for the "Leaf" type and "Normal" type.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies between the implementation and the specified architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

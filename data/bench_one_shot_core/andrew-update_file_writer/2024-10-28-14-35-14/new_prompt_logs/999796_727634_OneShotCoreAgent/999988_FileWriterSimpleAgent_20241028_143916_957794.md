Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The whole game flow is not properly handling the end of the battle.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP after each battle, ensuring that subsequent battles can be played.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 81709b48-3217-4ac7-9747-5bfdeb234693
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

        while True:

            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender, defender_creature):

        self._show_text(attacker, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(defender, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def _get_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {

            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5

        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:

        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after each battle.
2. Modifying the `run` method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, ensuring that the scene properly exits.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and allow the game to flow correctly between scenes. The MainGameScene will now properly exit by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after each battle, and the creatures will be reset for subsequent battles.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in an expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we either transition to another scene or quit the whole game.

2. We'll add a new method `_end_battle` that will handle the end of the battle, showing the result and then transitioning to the main menu or quitting the game.

3. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and if so, who won.

4. In the `run` method, we'll use the result from `_check_battle_end` to call `_end_battle` when appropriate.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, skill: Skill, defender: Player, defender_creature: Creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense

            return False  # Player lost
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            return True  # Player won
        return None  # Battle continues

    def _end_battle(self, player_won: bool):
        if player_won:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")

        # Ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choices = [play_again_button, quit_button]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This implementation ensures that the MainGameScene always exits properly by either transitioning to the MainMenuScene or quitting the whole game. The `_end_battle` method handles the end-of-battle logic, showing the result and prompting the player for their next action. This should resolve the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll describe how to fix these issues and then provide the updated file.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Handling the normal type differently in type effectiveness calculations:
We need to modify the `get_type_factor` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a special case for the "normal" type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

b) Resetting the player's creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene:
We'll add a method to reset the creature's state and call it before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene.

2. Rewriting the file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b5a64dff-de73-4e37-8810-2022f3e44918
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creature_states()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage.")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creature_states(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `get_type_factor` method now handles the "normal" type separately, always returning 1 for normal-type skills, which means they are neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

2. A new `reset_creature_states` method has been added, which resets the HP of all creatures to their maximum values. This method is called before transitioning back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the player's creature state is reset when leaving the MainGameScene.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies noted in the QA report while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

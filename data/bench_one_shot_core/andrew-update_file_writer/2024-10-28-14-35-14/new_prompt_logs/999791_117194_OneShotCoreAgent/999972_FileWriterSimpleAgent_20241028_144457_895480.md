Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll describe how to fix these issues and then provide the updated files.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Fully implementing the "leaf" type effectiveness in main_game_scene.py:
We need to ensure that the "leaf" type is properly handled in the type effectiveness calculations.

b) Adding a "leaf" type creature to the prototypes:
We'll add a new "leaf" type creature to the creature.json file to ensure that all mentioned types are represented in the game.

2. Rewriting the files with the proposed solution:

First, let's update the main_game_scene.py file:

# Excerpt ID: 80d05ad5-859a-4d07-b027-9b8af6dde7d5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creature_states()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self.calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} took {damage} damage.")

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types
        
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creature_states(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

Now, let's update the creature.json file to include a "leaf" type creature:

# Excerpt ID: de923a9f-19a0-46a9-ba47-6cb7b19b0b3c
```json main_game/content/creature.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "bubwool": {
      "display_name": "Bubwool",
      "description": "A water-type creature",
      "creature_type": "water",
      "hp": 32,
      "max_hp": 32,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 10,
      "sp_attack": 12,
      "sp_defense": 12,
      "speed": 13,
      "skills": ["tackle", "lick"]
    },
    "scizard": {
      "display_name": "Scizard",
      "description": "A fire-type creature",
      "creature_type": "fire",
      "hp": 40,
      "max_hp": 40,
      "attack": 11,
      "defense": 13,
      "sp_attack": 11,
      "sp_defense": 13,
      "speed": 11,
      "skills": ["tackle", "fireball"]
    },
    "leafeon": {
      "display_name": "Leafeon",
      "description": "A leaf-type creature",
      "creature_type": "leaf",
      "hp": 35,
      "max_hp": 35,
      "attack": 12,
      "defense": 11,
      "sp_attack": 13,
      "sp_defense": 11,
      "speed": 12,
      "skills": ["tackle", "leaf_blade"]
    }
  }
}
```

Lastly, we need to add a new skill for the leaf-type creature in the skill.json file:

# Excerpt ID: 118f9b31-7b8e-4b4b-812f-486b192af887
```json main_game/content/skill.json
{
  "prototypes": {
    "tackle": {
      "display_name": "Tackle",
      "description": "Throw yourself at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "normal",
      "is_physical": true,
      "base_damage": 7
    },
    "fireball": {
      "display_name": "Fireball",
      "description": "Throw fire at a foe, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "fire",
      "is_physical": false,
      "base_damage": 5
    },
    "lick": {
      "display_name": "Lick",
      "description": "Lick a foe with a wet tongue, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "water",
      "is_physical": true,
      "base_damage": 5
    },
    "leaf_blade": {
      "display_name": "Leaf Blade",
      "description": "Strike the foe with a sharp leaf, dealing damage.",
      "skill_type": "leaf",
      "is_physical": true,
      "base_damage": 6
    }
  }
}
```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The "leaf" type effectiveness is now fully implemented in the main_game_scene.py file.
2. A new "leaf" type creature (Leafeon) has been added to the creature prototypes, along with a corresponding "leaf" type skill (Leaf Blade).

These modifications ensure that the implementation fully matches the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine. The changes don't affect the models or the overall structure of the game, maintaining the pure data schema nature of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`. This is causing the tests to fail because the scene is not exiting properly. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `run` method to ensure that after the battle ends, we transition back to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends, to prepare for potential future battles.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns a boolean to indicate whether the battle has ended.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: 19232448-66b7-4ae4-8c23-90c68e4322bc
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended. Returning to main menu.")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Opponent's {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.opponent, f"Your {self.opponent_creature.display_name} used {foe_skill.display_name}!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._show_text(self.opponent, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The `run` method now properly exits by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We've added a `reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
3. The `check_battle_end` method now correctly returns a boolean.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` to properly end the game by calling either `_quit_whole_game()` or `_transition_to_scene()` when the battle ends. Currently, the scene is terminating without properly signaling the end of the game or transitioning to another scene.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `run()` method of `MainGameScene`, we'll add a check after the battle ends to either transition back to the main menu or quit the game.
2. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end()` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and if so, who won.
3. We'll add a new method `_end_game()` to handle the game ending logic, including showing the final result and transitioning or quitting.

Here's the rewritten `MainGameScene` with these changes:

        while True:

            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):

        return False, False  # Battle not ended

    def _end_game(self, player_won):
        if player_won:

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")

        # Ask the player if they want to play again or quit
        play_again_button = Button("Play Again")
        quit_button = Button("Quit")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again_button, quit_button])

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This revised `MainGameScene` addresses the issue by ensuring that the game always ends with either a transition to the main menu or by quitting the game entirely. The `_end_game()` method has been added to handle the end-of-battle logic, including showing the result and prompting the player to play again or quit.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and allow the game to properly complete its flow in the random test runs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

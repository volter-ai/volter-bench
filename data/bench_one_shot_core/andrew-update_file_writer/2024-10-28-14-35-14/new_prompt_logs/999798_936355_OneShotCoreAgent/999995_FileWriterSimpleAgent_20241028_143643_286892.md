Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene after the battle ends.
2. The `test_full_game_flow_random_with_bots` test is failing because the game is not properly ending or transitioning after the battle.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` to properly transition or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the `check_battle_end` method returns `True` when the battle is over.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: b12222a8-eec8-46ce-83f3-0a06f1dcea86
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Choose your skill:")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices).thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.opponent, "Opponent is choosing a skill...")
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        return self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices).thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {opponent_skill.display_name}!")
            self.player_creature.hp -= opponent_skill.damage
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {opponent_skill.damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Ensuring that the `run` method properly exits the battle loop and transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` when the battle ends.
2. Adding a `reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle, preparing them for potential future battles.
3. Maintaining the correct structure and use of the engine's methods, such as `_transition_to_scene` and `_show_text`.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flows correctly between scenes. The `MainGameScene` now properly exits and transitions back to the main menu after a battle ends, addressing both the random test failures and the full game flow test issues.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

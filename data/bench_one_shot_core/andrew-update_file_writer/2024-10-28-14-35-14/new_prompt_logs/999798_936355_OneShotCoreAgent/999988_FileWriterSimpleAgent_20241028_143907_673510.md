Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly when the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to handle the end of the battle, which will transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game.
2. We'll modify the run method to continue the game loop until the battle ends.
3. We'll update the check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: fe58d48d-0928-4fe8-b250-34aa90b78130
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            if self.player_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
            if self.opponent_turn():
                if self.check_battle_end():
                    break
        self.end_battle()

    def player_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It's your turn, {self.player.display_name}!")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        chosen_skill = next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)
        return self.execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, chosen_skill)

    def opponent_turn(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It's {self.opponent.display_name}'s turn!")
        chosen_skill = random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name} chose {chosen_skill.display_name}!")
        return self.execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, chosen_skill)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        type_factor = self.get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(raw_damage * type_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"It dealt {final_damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")
        return defender.hp == 0

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type: str, defender_type: str):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):
            return 0.5
        else:
            return 1

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"The opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "The battle has ended!")
        choices = [Button("Return to Main Menu"), Button("Quit Game")]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        if choice.display_name == "Return to Main Menu":
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `run` method to continue the game loop until `battle_ended` is True.
3. Updating the `check_battle_end` method to set `battle_ended` to True when the battle ends.
4. Adding an `end_battle` method that gives the player the option to return to the main menu or quit the game.

These changes ensure that the scene exits properly when the battle ends and that the game transitions to the main menu or quits as expected. This should resolve the test failures and make the game flow work correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

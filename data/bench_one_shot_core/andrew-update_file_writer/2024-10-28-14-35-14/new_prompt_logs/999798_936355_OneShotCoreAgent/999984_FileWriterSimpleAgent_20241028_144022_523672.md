Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address the issues raised during QA/testing and propose a solution that aligns with the described architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Description of the fix:

a) Skill execution order based on creature speed:
   We'll modify the MainGameScene to determine the order of skill execution based on the creatures' speed stats. If speeds are equal, we'll use random selection.

b) Complete type relationship implementation:
   We'll update the get_type_factor method to include the "Normal" type, which is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

c) Showing the opponent's skill choices:
   We'll modify the opponent_turn method to display the opponent's available skills before making a choice.

2. Rewriting the main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solution:

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Implementing skill execution order based on creature speed in the `resolve_turn` and `determine_order` methods.
2. Updating the `get_type_factor` method to include the "Normal" type, which always returns a factor of 1.
3. Modifying the `opponent_turn` method to display the opponent's available skills before making a choice.

The implementation now aligns with the described architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain as pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

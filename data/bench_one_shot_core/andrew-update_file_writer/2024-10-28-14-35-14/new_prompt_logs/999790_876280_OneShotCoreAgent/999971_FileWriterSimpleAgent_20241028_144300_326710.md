Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that we're trying to use Creature objects as dictionary keys, which triggers the __hash__ method and raises the FixableException. To fix this, we need to modify the Player model to store creature prototype_ids instead of Creature objects, and then create the Creature objects when needed.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Modify the Player model in `models.py` to store creature prototype_ids instead of Creature objects.
2. Update the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in `main.py` to work with the new Player model structure.

Let's rewrite the `models.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: ad7ee299-cfe0-46e2-ba4c-da4b33afef75
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[str]  # Store skill prototype_ids instead of Skill objects

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creature_ids: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)  # Store creature prototype_ids
    active_creature_id: Optional[str] = None  # Store active creature prototype_id
```

Now, let's update the `main.py` file to work with the new Player model structure:

# Excerpt ID: 36048732-41ec-4cd8-bedd-e72a7713eaa1
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
import uuid

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_from_game_database("default_player", Player)
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # creature_ids are already stored as prototype_ids, no need to modify
        
        # Set active_creature_id to the first creature_id if available
        if player.creature_ids:
            player.active_creature_id = player.creature_ids[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_from_game_database(prototype_id, Player)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # creature_ids are already stored as prototype_ids, no need to modify
        
        # Set active_creature_id to the first creature_id if available
        if bot.creature_ids:
            bot.active_creature_id = bot.creature_ids[0]
        
        return bot

    def get_creature(self, creature_id: str) -> Creature:
        return create_from_game_database(creature_id, Creature)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Storing creature prototype_ids in the Player model instead of Creature objects.
2. Simplifying the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods to work with prototype_ids.
3. Adding a `get_creature` method to the App class to create Creature objects when needed.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of data models and logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and we avoid using Creature objects as dictionary keys, which was causing the FixableException.

In the game scenes and other parts of the code where you need to work with Creature objects, you'll need to use the `app.get_creature(creature_id)` method to create Creature instances from the stored prototype_ids. This approach ensures that we're not using AbstractThing objects as hashable IDs and follows the engine's guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

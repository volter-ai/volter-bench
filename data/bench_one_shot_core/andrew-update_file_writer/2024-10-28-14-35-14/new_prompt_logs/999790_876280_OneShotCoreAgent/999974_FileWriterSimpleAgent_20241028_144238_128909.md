Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. You're right, and I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method to the Player model, which violates the rule that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties. Let's fix this issue by adhering to the guidelines and architecture of the engine.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player class in `models.py`.
2. Keep the Player, Creature, and Skill models as pure data schemas.
3. Move the logic for creating Player instances with initialized creatures to the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in the `App` class in `main.py`.

Here's the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 62cc6c59-e924-4fe8-abb5-bc33207bc34c
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field
from typing import List, Optional

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = None
```

Now, let's update the `main.py` file to handle the creation of Player instances with properly initialized creatures:

# Excerpt ID: eb7bedcb-31ab-420f-b2a0-bd840299fd57
```python main_game/main.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
import uuid

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_from_game_database("default_player", Player)
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        
        # Initialize creatures
        player.creatures = [create_from_game_database(creature_id, Creature) for creature_id in player.creatures]
        
        # Set active_creature to the first creature if available
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_from_game_database(prototype_id, Player)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        
        # Initialize creatures
        bot.creatures = [create_from_game_database(creature_id, Creature) for creature_id in bot.creatures]
        
        # Set active_creature to the first creature if available
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Keeping the models in `models.py` as pure data schemas without any methods.
2. Using the `create_from_game_database` function to create instances of Player and Creature.
3. Initializing the `creatures` list and `active_creature` in the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods of the `App` class.

This approach stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the separation of data models and logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and the logic for creating and initializing Player instances is now in the appropriate place in the `App` class.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address both problems in the MainGameScene class. Here's how I plan to fix these issues:

1. Damage Calculation: I'll modify the `calculate_damage` method to use floats for the raw damage calculation and only convert to an integer at the final step.

2. Leaf Type: I'll add the "leaf" type to the effectiveness dictionary in the `get_type_factor` method.

Here's the updated MainGameScene class with these fixes:

# Excerpt ID: 4836815a-f093-49e9-b879-206d05f2bc21
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

    def get_skill_choices_str(self, creature):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)

            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. In the `calculate_damage` method, we now use `float()` to ensure that the calculations are done with floating-point precision. The final result is still converted to an integer using `int()` at the end of the calculation.

2. In the `get_type_factor` method, the effectiveness dictionary now includes the "leaf" type with its proper relationships to other types.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies between the implementation and the described architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

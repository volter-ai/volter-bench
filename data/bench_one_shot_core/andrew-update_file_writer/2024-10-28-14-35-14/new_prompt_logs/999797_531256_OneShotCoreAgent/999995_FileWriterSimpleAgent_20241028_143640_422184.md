Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The battle is ending abruptly without transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
2. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle ends.
3. We'll ensure that the scene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 157d1a20-c267-45cd-9e2f-eec85515fab8
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
Your {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return

    def _player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self, opponent: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        return self._player_choice_phase(opponent, creature)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"You used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp -= player_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent's {self.opponent_creature.display_name} took {player_skill.damage} damage!")

        self._show_text(self.player, f"Opponent used {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp -= foe_skill.damage
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your {self.player_creature.display_name} took {foe_skill.damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `_reset_creatures` method to restore the creatures' HP after the battle.
2. Modifying the `run` method to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.
3. Ensuring that the scene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene` at the end of the battle.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene will now properly exit by transitioning back to the main menu after each battle, and the creatures' HP will be reset for future battles.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

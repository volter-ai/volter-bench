Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The game is not transitioning or quitting after the battle ends.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly transition or quit the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the run method to break the loop and transition when the battle ends.
3. We'll update the check_battle_end method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 410c47a3-900b-4ec5-8067-e585411e190f
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.end_battle()
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {final_damage} damage!")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        play_again = Button("Play Again")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choices = [play_again, quit_game]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding an `end_battle` method that presents the player with options to play again or quit the game.
2. Modifying the `run` method to break the loop and call `end_battle` when the battle ends.
3. Updating the `check_battle_end` method to return a boolean, which is then used in the `run` method to determine when to end the battle.

These changes ensure that the scene properly transitions or quits after the battle ends, resolving the issues raised in the QA/testing phase. The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the existing architecture and model structure.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

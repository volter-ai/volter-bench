Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address both problems and provide a solution that adheres to the specified architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix these issues, I will:

   a. Modify the damage calculation in MainGameScene to use floats throughout the process, only converting to an integer at the final step.
   
   b. Add a method to reset the player's creature state when transitioning out of MainGameScene.

2. I'll rewrite the MainGameScene file to implement these changes. The models.py file doesn't need to be modified as it already follows the guidelines of being pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 91f5f461-25f7-4e88-90f8-071d47dc678d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{self._get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def _get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            if self._check_battle_end():
                break

            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self._check_battle_end():
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - int(damage))
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {int(damage)} damage!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return raw_damage * type_factor

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2.0,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2.0,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2.0,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1.0)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            self._end_battle()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self._end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._reset_player_creature()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def _reset_player_creature(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address both issues:

1. The damage calculation now uses floats throughout the process, only converting to an integer when updating the creature's HP and displaying the damage.

2. A new method `_reset_player_creature` has been added, which resets the HP of all the player's creatures to their maximum value. This method is called in the `_end_battle` method, ensuring that the player's creature state is reset when transitioning out of the MainGameScene.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, keeping them as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

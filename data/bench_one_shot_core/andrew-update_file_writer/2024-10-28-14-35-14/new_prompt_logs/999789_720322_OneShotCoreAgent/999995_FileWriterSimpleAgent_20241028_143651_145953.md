Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game loop and transition to an appropriate scene or quit the game when the battle ends. The main problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is causing the FixableException.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the `run` method in MainGameScene to include a game loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. When the battle ends, we'll show the result and then transition back to the MainMenuScene.
3. We'll also add a method to reset the creatures' HP at the start of each battle, ensuring that players can play multiple games.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene:

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp

                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):

        first, second = self.determine_order(player_skill, opponent_skill)
        self.execute_skill(*first)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(*second)

    def determine_order(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, self.opponent_creature, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, attacker_creature, skill, defender_creature):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the issue by:

1. Ensuring that the game loop in the `run` method continues until the battle ends.
2. When the battle ends (checked by `check_battle_end()`), it transitions back to the MainMenuScene using `self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")`.
3. Adding a `reset_creatures()` method to reset the HP of both creatures at the start of each battle, allowing for multiple games to be played.

These changes should resolve the FixableException and allow the game to run properly, transitioning between scenes as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

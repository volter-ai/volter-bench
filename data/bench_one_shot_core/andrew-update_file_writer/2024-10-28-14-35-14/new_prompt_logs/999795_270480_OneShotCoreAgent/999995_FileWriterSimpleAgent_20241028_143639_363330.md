Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game after the battle concludes.

2. The `MainGameScene` is not handling the end of the battle correctly, which is causing the test to fail.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, regardless of whether the player wins or loses.

2. We'll update the `_check_battle_end` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, and use this in the main game loop to determine when to transition.

3. We'll ensure that the `run` method of `MainGameScene` always ends with either a transition or quitting the game.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 1ba7f626-ba28-4065-acb5-99a260a673c0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your skills:
{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()

            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._foe_choice_phase()

            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)

            # Check for battle end
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to Main Menu...")
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                return  # Ensure we exit the run method after transitioning

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} uses {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.opponent_creature.hp = max(0, self.opponent_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} uses {foe_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - foe_skill.damage)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self._reset_creatures()
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes should address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The `run` method now always ends with a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle concludes.
2. The `_check_battle_end` method returns a boolean, which is used in the main game loop to determine when to transition.
3. We've added a safeguard in the `_resolution_phase` to ensure HP doesn't go below 0.

These modifications should resolve the "scene was not exited in an expected manner" error and ensure that the game flow works as expected. The scene will now properly transition or quit, addressing the FixableException raised in the whole game test.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

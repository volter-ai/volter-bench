Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation and then write the necessary files for the creature battler game. Let's begin with the plan:

1. Models:
   - We'll create Player, Creature, and Skill models in `models.py`.
   - These will inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer as appropriate.
   - We'll ensure proper dependency order and avoid circular references.

2. Content:
   - We'll create JSON files for Player, Creature, and Skill in the `content` folder.
   - These will contain the prototype data for each model.

3. Scenes:
   - We'll implement MainMenuScene and MainGameScene in separate files.
   - Each scene will have a corresponding test file.
   - We'll ensure proper use of transition methods and string representations.

4. Main:
   - We'll update the `main.py` file to include the new MainGameScene.

Now, let's implement the files:

This completes the implementation of the creature battler game. Let's summarize the changes and additions:

1. We've created the necessary models (Player, Creature, Skill) in `models.py`.
2. We've added JSON files for Player, Creature, and Skill prototypes in the `content` folder.
3. We've implemented the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene, along with their corresponding test files.
4. We've updated the `main.py` file to include the new MainGameScene.

The game now has a functional main menu and a battle system where players can fight against a bot opponent using their creatures and skills. The battle system includes attack and swap mechanics, as well as type effectiveness calculations.

To run the game, you can execute the `main.py` file. The game will start with the MainMenuScene, allowing the player to choose between playing (which leads to the MainGameScene) or quitting the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I understand the issues and will address them accordingly. Here's how I plan to fix these discrepancies:

1. To handle equal speed scenarios for skill execution order:
   We'll modify the resolve_turn method to use Python's random.shuffle() function when speeds are equal. This will ensure that equal speeds are resolved randomly with equal chance.

2. To explicitly convert the final damage to an integer:
   We'll modify the calculate_damage method to perform all calculations using floats and then convert the final result to an integer using the int() function.

These changes will be implemented in the main_game_scene.py file, as they relate to game logic rather than model definitions. This approach adheres to the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine without modifying the models.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address both issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The `resolve_turn` method now handles equal speed scenarios by grouping actions by speed, shuffling each group, and then flattening the list. This ensures that creatures with equal speed have an equal chance of going first.

2. The `calculate_damage` method now explicitly uses floats for all calculations and converts the final result to an integer using the `int()` function. This ensures that the damage calculation adheres to the specified architecture.

These modifications maintain the existing game logic and adhere to the architecture guidelines without modifying any models. The changes are confined to the MainGameScene class, which is responsible for managing the battle logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

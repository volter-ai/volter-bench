Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The error is occurring because we added a class method to the Player model, which violates the guideline that models should be pure data schemas without methods or properties. To fix this, we need to remove the class method from the Player model and handle the initialization of the active_creature in the App class instead.

Here's how we'll fix the issue:

1. Remove the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player model in `models.py`.
2. Modify the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods in the `App` class to initialize the `active_creature` after creating the player or bot.

Let's rewrite the necessary files:

# Excerpt ID: 9547ea3d-879d-4177-8a98-fb33abff8462
```python main_game/models.py
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import List, Optional
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractThing, AbstractPlayer, Field

class Skill(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Skill"
    skill_type: str
    is_physical: bool
    base_damage: int

class Creature(AbstractThing):
    category: str = "Creature"
    creature_type: str
    hp: int
    max_hp: int
    attack: int
    defense: int
    sp_attack: int
    sp_defense: int
    speed: int
    skills: List[Skill]

class Player(AbstractPlayer):
    category: str = "Player"
    creatures: List[Creature] = Field(default_factory=list)
    active_creature: Optional[Creature] = Field(default=None)
```

# Excerpt ID: f9b958f7-7cf9-4b43-b785-f0b19251493f
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = create_from_game_database("default_player", Player)
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        if player.creatures:
            player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = create_from_game_database(prototype_id, Player)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        if bot.creatures:
            bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Removing the `from_prototype_id` class method from the Player model, making it a pure data schema.
2. Using the `create_from_game_database` function in the App class to create Player instances.
3. Initializing the `active_creature` in the `create_player` and `create_bot` methods of the App class.

This solution adheres to the guidelines and architecture of the game:
- The models remain pure data schemas without methods or properties.
- The initialization logic is moved to the App class, which is responsible for creating and managing game entities.
- We're using the provided `create_from_game_database` function to create instances of the Player model.

These changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the tests to run without errors related to the Player model definition.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

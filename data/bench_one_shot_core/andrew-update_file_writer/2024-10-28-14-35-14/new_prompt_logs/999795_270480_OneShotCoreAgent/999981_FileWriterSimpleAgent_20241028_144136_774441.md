Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the NameError that occurs when trying to register the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene in the App class. The error suggests that these scene classes are not imported in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll import the necessary scene classes in the main.py file.
2. We'll also import the required modules from the engine library to ensure all dependencies are met.

Let's rewrite the main.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 03fe81d7-30f4-445a-bb36-2609e07dc021
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution addresses the NameError by importing the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes from their respective modules. We've also imported the necessary components from the engine library (AbstractApp, HumanListener, and BotListener) to ensure all dependencies are met.

The changes made are:

1. Added import statements for MainMenuScene and MainGameScene.
2. Added import statements for AbstractApp, HumanListener, and BotListener from the engine library.
3. Kept the existing Player import from the models module.

These changes should resolve the NameError and allow the App class to properly register the scenes. The rest of the file remains unchanged, maintaining the existing functionality of creating players and bots.

This solution adheres to the guidelines and architecture of the game, as it doesn't modify any models or scene implementations. It simply ensures that the necessary components are imported and available for use in the main App class.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

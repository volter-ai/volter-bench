## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the main problem: the MainGameScene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. This is causing the test to fail because the scene is not exiting in the expected manner. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the battle_loop method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends, instead of just breaking the loop.

2. We'll also add a check in the resolution_phase to see if the battle has ended, and if so, transition to the MainMenuScene.

3. We'll remove the `_quit_whole_game` call from the check_battle_end method, as this should be handled by the MainMenuScene.

Here's the proposed solution for the MainGameScene:

# Excerpt ID: f6cdf359-0fce-4f48-919a-c97c4d0de091
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join(skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appears!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while not self.battle_ended:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, opponent_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return

        self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)
        self.check_battle_end()

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} uses {skill.display_name}! {defender.display_name} takes {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            return True
        return False
```

This solution addresses the main issues:

1. The battle_loop now continues until self.battle_ended is True, which is set in the check_battle_end method.
2. After the battle ends, we transition back to the MainMenuScene instead of breaking the loop or quitting the game.
3. The resolution_phase now checks if the battle has ended after each skill execution, preventing unnecessary skill executions if the battle is already over.
4. We've removed the _quit_whole_game call, as the game should continue running and return to the main menu after a battle.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly by transitioning back to the MainMenuScene. The scene will no longer terminate without calling transition_to_scene, addressing the FixableException raised in the test.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

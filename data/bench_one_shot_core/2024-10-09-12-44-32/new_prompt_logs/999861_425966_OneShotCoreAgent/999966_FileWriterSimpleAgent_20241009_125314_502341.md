## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to address the problem in the MainGameScene where the game is not properly ending or transitioning to another scene after the battle concludes. The error message indicates that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or `transition_to_scene`, which is causing the test to fail.

Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll modify the `MainGameScene` to properly end the game or transition to another scene after the battle concludes.
2. We'll add a check in the `game_loop` method to break the loop when the battle ends.
3. We'll implement a method to handle the end of the battle, which will either transition to another scene or quit the game.

Let's rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issue by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to track when the battle is over.
2. Modifying the `game_loop` to check for the `battle_ended` flag and break the loop when it's set.
3. Implementing an `_end_battle` method that resets the creatures' states and transitions back to the main menu.

This solution ensures that the scene properly ends and transitions to another scene (in this case, back to the main menu) when the battle concludes. It stays within the capabilities of the engine by using the provided `_transition_to_scene` method to handle the scene transition.

The changes maintain the separation of concerns, keeping the game logic within the scene and not adding any methods or properties to the data models. This approach should resolve the issue while adhering to the guidelines and architecture of the game engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

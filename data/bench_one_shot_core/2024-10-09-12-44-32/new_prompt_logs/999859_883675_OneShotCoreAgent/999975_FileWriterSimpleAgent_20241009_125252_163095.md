## Proposed Code Change
To address the minor discrepancies regarding the timing of damage calculation and the display of messages, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the architecture, I propose the following changes:

1. Modify the `execute_skill` method in the `MainGameScene` class to calculate and display damage before actually applying it to the defender's HP.
2. Add more detailed messages to show the steps of damage calculation, including the weakness factor.
3. Ensure that all messages are displayed using the `_show_text` method.

These changes will improve the clarity of the battle process and align more closely with the specifications without altering the core functionality or the model structure.

Here's the updated `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with these changes implemented:

```

These changes provide more detailed information about the battle process, including step-by-step damage calculation and application. The core functionality remains the same, but the user experience is improved with more informative messages. The changes are confined to the `MainGameScene` class and do not affect the models or the overall architecture of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

You are an expert software developer and you think very carefully before you code. You always write the complete code file instead of just an excerpt

Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should be inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Never create data models directly.  Always use `create_from_game_database`

**IMPORTANT**:  All data models should reference other data models' types directly.  Do not change them to lists of IDs to avoid unhashable errors.  The correct pattern is to use the IDs with `create_from_game_database` to construct instances of Things.  If the ID is missing, it's missing from the corresponding JSON file defining the data that exists for various things.
If you see unhashable type errors with our domain objects, it is likely because **you forgot to use the ID outside the `models.py` file,** which is not an indication that you should change the `models.py`.  (For example, you might have used `player.cards[0]` as an index instead of `player.cards[0].prototype_id`).

```markdown main_game/docs/overview.md
# Overview

This is the overview document for a creature battler game. In this game, the player assembles a team of creatures to fight against another player's team of creatures to see who can reduce their opponent's health to zero first.

## Game Scenes

- **MainMenuScene** - This is the starting scene and where the player can choose to play or quit.
- **MainGameScene** - This is the scene where the action takes place. Here, the player does battle against a bot opponent.

## Game Entities

- **Player** - A thing that represents a human or bot within the game, and is controlled by the human or bot.
- **Creature** - A thing that does battle within the game. **Player**s manage a team of creatures in battle.
- **Skill** - A thing that represents the actions that the **Creature**s are able to take in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_menu_scene.md
# MainMenuScene

The Main Menu scene allows the player to play the game or quit.

## Scene Logic

At the start of the scene, the player is shown a welcome message and the scene then prompts the player to play or quit. 
- One choice that will take the player to the **MainGameScene**.
- One choice that quits the game entirely.

```

```markdown main_game/docs/scenes/main_game_scene.md
# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```

All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

When transitioning out of this scene, reset the state of the player's creatures.
```

# Player

The Player is an entity in the game "Creature Battle" that is controlled by a human or a bot. 

## Additional Attributes

- `creatures` - The collection of creatures that the player has at their disposal. 
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/creature.md
# Creature

Creature is an entity in the creature battler game that participates in battles.

## Additional Attributes

- `creature_type` - A string representing the creature's elemental affinity. This decides the creature's weaknesses and resistances.
- `hp` - An integer representing the number of health points the creature has. The creature is knocked out when this number reaches zero.
- `max_hp` - An integer representing the maximum number of health points a creature can have.
- `attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's physical attacks.
- `defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to physical attacks.
- `sp_attack` - An integer representing the added power behind the creature's non-physical attacks.
- `sp_defense` - An integer representing the creature's physical resistance to non-physical attacks.
- `speed` - An integer representing the creature's priority when deciding turn order.
- `skills` - A collection of the skills that the creature has access to in battle.
```

```markdown main_game/docs/models/skill.md
# Skill

Skill represents actions that creatures can take in battle.

## Additional Attributes

- `skill_type` - A string representing the elemental affinity of the skill. This is used in deciding whether the skill is effective or ineffective against a target.
- `is_physical` - A boolean indicating whether the skill is a physical skill or a non-physical (special) skill.
- `base_damage` - An integer representing the damage that is dealt to a foe when the skill is executed.

                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()
```






Models Guidelines:
- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer
- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties
- All data models should reference other data models' types directly, not string IDs or forward references
- Be extremely careful about referencing other models. All data models must be written in strict dependency order. A model cannot reference its own type and a model cannot reference the type of any model which is not defined above it in the file
- Be sure to import `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of `models.py`

Scene Guidelines:
- All game logic should be written inside of scenes
- Use the transition methods to change scenes, do not construct a scene directly 
- The test scenes should be pytests that just run the scene 10 times using the HumanListener's random mode to make random choices. No other unit tests are necessary
- The `__str__` method of the scene should show all the content needed for all the phases of the logic of the scene. Think about it like a visual layout. All the relevant data should be shown in there
- If models need to be created, `from_prototype_id` must be used
- If the scene has bots, all bots must be created using `create_bot`. Bots should be treated exactly the same as a player. `_show_text` and `_wait_for_choice` must also be called on bots and we should rely on the BotListener to select their choices

Directions:
1. First think carefully and describe in detail what you're going to do. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan 

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```

Role: assistant
Content: Thank you for providing the detailed instructions and guidelines. I'll carefully plan out the implementation of the creature battler game based on the given architecture and requirements.

Plan:

1. Update `main_game/models.py`:
   - Import necessary types and classes from the engine.
   - Define `Skill`, `Creature`, and `Player` classes, inheriting from `AbstractThing` or `AbstractPlayer`.
   - Ensure proper ordering of class definitions to avoid circular dependencies.

2. Create JSON files in `main_game/content/`:
   - `skill.json`: Define skill prototypes.
   - `creature.json`: Define creature prototypes.
   - `player.json`: Define player prototypes.

3. Update `main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py`:
   - Implement the `MainMenuScene` class with options to play or quit.
   - Use `_transition_to_scene` to move to the `MainGameScene` when "Play" is chosen.

4. Create `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py`:
   - Implement the `MainGameScene` class with the battle logic.
   - Include player choice, foe choice, and resolution phases.
   - Implement damage calculation based on skill types and creature attributes.
   - Handle battle end conditions and transitions.

5. Update `main_game/main.py`:
   - Register both `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene`.

6. Create test files:
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_menu_scene.py`
   - `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Now, I'll write out each file according to this plan.

These files implement the creature battler game according to the provided architecture and requirements. The game includes a main menu scene and a main game scene where players can battle against a bot opponent using their creatures and skills. The implementation follows the guidelines for models, scenes, and testing.

Content: there was an issue [issue redacted] with the implementation, fix it
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Update the `_get_weakness_factor` method to handle the 'normal' type correctly, which should be neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.

2. Modify the `_calculate_damage` method to ensure that the special attack damage is converted to an integer after all calculations are done, not before.

3. Move the `_reset_creatures` method call to the beginning of the `run` method instead of at the end, to ensure that creature states are reset when entering the scene, not when leaving it.

        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA/testing:

1. The 'normal' type is now handled correctly in the `_get_weakness_factor` method, always returning a factor of 1.
2. The damage calculation in `_calculate_damage` now converts the final result to an integer after all calculations are done, ensuring that special attack damage is not rounded prematurely.
3. The `_reset_creatures` method is now called at the beginning of the `run` method, ensuring that creature states are reset when entering the scene, not when leaving it.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models.

Content: Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix the issues:

   a) In MainMenuScene, we'll use `_show_text` to display the welcome message explicitly to the player.
   
   b) In MainGameScene, we'll modify the damage calculation to use floats explicitly before converting to integers.
   
   c) We'll move the creature reset logic to occur when transitioning out of MainGameScene, not at the start of the battle.
   
   d) We'll remove the reset of the opponent's creatures, as it's not mentioned in the architecture.

2. We need to rewrite both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene files to implement these fixes. Here are the updated files:

```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The welcome message is now explicitly shown to the player in MainMenuScene using `_show_text`.
2. Damage calculations in MainGameScene now explicitly use floats before converting to integers.
3. The state of the player's creatures is reset when transitioning out of MainGameScene, not at the start of the battle.
4. The opponent's creatures are no longer reset, as it wasn't mentioned in the architecture.

These modifications should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the integrity of the models.

Do the following:

1. describe how you will fix the above issue, taking into account the models and the architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine

2. rewrite the file you need to fix with the proposed solution



Guidelines reminders:

- All the "models" in the game should inherit from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer

- The classes in `models.py` must be pure 'data schemas' without methods or properties



Write out all code files in the format (only use the format header once):

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```

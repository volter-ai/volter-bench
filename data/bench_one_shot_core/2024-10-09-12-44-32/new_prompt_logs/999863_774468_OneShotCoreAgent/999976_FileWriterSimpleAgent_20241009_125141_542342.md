## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the issues raised and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a. Correct the damage calculation formulas:
      - We'll implement the exact formulas for physical and special attacks as described in the architecture.
      - We'll explicitly show the conversion of damage calculations to integers.

   b. Adjust the state reset for creatures:
      - We'll only reset the state of the player's creature when transitioning out of MainGameScene, as specified in the architecture.

2. We'll rewrite the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file to implement these fixes.

Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 5a81d079-fbb6-4967-8afe-84e6ceef9473
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        # Reset player's creature state before transitioning
        self.reset_player_creature_state()
        # Transition back to the main menu after the battle ends
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else foe_skill
        second_skill = foe_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:

        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        else:
            raw_damage = float(attacker.sp_attack) / float(defender.sp_defense) * float(skill.base_damage)

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"normal": 1, "fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"normal": 1, "fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_player_creature_state(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The damage calculation formulas in the `execute_skill()` method now exactly match the specified formulas for both physical and special attacks. We've also explicitly shown the conversion of damage calculations to integers using the `int()` function.

2. We've updated the state reset to only reset the player's creature HP when transitioning out of the scene. This is done in the `reset_player_creature_state()` method, which is called before transitioning back to the main menu.

3. The `calculate_weakness_factor()` method remains unchanged as it was already correctly implemented.

These changes should resolve the discrepancies with the architecture and ensure that the implementation aligns with the specified requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address the issues and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Special skill damage calculation:
We'll modify the damage calculation for special attacks to use float division instead of integer division. We'll then round the result to the nearest integer to maintain consistency with physical attacks.

b) Final damage calculation:
We'll adjust the final damage calculation to follow the specified architecture more closely. We'll calculate the raw damage first, then apply the weakness factor, and finally round the result to the nearest integer.

c) Simultaneous creature knockouts:
We'll update the `check_battle_end` method to handle cases where both creatures are knocked out simultaneously, resulting in a draw.

Now, I'll rewrite the MainGameScene with these proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: b00560d1-082a-4abb-b500-bf155014a40d
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random
import math

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                self.reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        return random.choice(self.opponent_creature.skills)

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = round(raw_damage * weakness_factor)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}! It dealt {final_damage} damage.")

    def calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == "normal":
            return 1
        effectiveness = {
            "fire": {"leaf": 2, "water": 0.5},
            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0 and self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "The battle ended in a draw!")
            return True
        elif self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. Special attack damage calculation now uses float division instead of integer division.
2. The final damage calculation now follows the specified architecture more closely by applying the weakness factor after calculating the raw damage.
3. The `check_battle_end` method now handles simultaneous creature knockouts, resulting in a draw.

These modifications maintain the architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities while addressing the QA concerns. The models remain pure data schemas, and the game logic is contained within the scene as required.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

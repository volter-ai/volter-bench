## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I'll focus on modifying the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Equal speed resolution: In the resolution phase, when two creatures have the same speed, we'll implement a random selection to determine which one goes first.

2. Forced swapping: We'll implement a method to handle forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero. This method will be called after each attack in the resolution phase.

Here's the proposed solution:

```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):

```

This updated implementation addresses both issues:

1. Equal speed resolution: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we now randomly shuffle actions with equal speed.

2. Forced swapping: We've added the `_check_and_handle_fainted_creature` method, which is called after each attack in the resolution phase. This method checks if the active creature has fainted (HP = 0) and forces a swap if there are available creatures.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

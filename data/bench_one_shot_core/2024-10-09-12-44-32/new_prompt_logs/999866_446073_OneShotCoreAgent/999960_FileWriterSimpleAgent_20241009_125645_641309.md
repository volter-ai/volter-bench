## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address each point and propose a solution that aligns with the architecture description and stays within the capabilities of the engine.

Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Add a 'Back' option in the Player and Bot Choice phases.
2. Implement handling for equal speed scenarios during skill execution.
3. Add forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.
4. Explicitly convert damage from float to integer.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class. We don't need to modify the models as they are already correct pure data schemas.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

```

This solution addresses all the issues raised:

1. Added a 'Back' option in both `choose_attack` and `choose_swap` methods for the Player Choice phase. The Bot Choice phase doesn't need a 'Back' option as it's automated.
2. Implemented handling for equal speed scenarios in the `resolve_turn` method by shuffling the actions when speeds are equal.
3. Added forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero with the `check_and_force_swap` method, called after each attack.
4. Explicitly converted damage from float to integer in the `calculate_damage` method.

These changes align with the architecture description and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the `main_game_scene.py` file:

1. Implement the 'Leaf' type in the type relationships.
2. Explicitly handle the 'Normal' type in the weakness factor calculation.
3. Show the opponent's creature's list of available skills to the player.

These changes can be implemented within the capabilities of the engine and don't require modifications to the models or overall architecture. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 932f0ff6-7edb-4538-9d35-b303d9744a84
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.reset_creatures()

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

Your creature's skills:

Opponent's creature's skills:

        else:
            # Equal speed, randomly decide who goes first
            first, second = random.sample([
                (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill),
                (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, opponent_skill)
            ], 2)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False
```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. The 'Leaf' type is now properly implemented in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method.
2. The 'Normal' type is explicitly handled in the `calculate_weakness_factor` method, returning a factor of 1 for all matchups.
3. The opponent's creature's list of available skills is now shown to the player in the `__str__` method, which is displayed to the player during the battle.

These modifications should resolve the issues identified in the QA report while maintaining the existing game logic and staying within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing this issue to my attention. I'll address the problem by implementing the random decision for execution order when creatures have equal speed in the Resolution Phase.

1. To fix this issue, we'll modify the `_resolution_phase` method in the `MainGameScene` class. We'll add a check for equal speed and use Python's `random.choice()` function to randomly decide which creature goes first in that case. This solution aligns with the architecture and stays within the capabilities of the engine without modifying any models.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b40c4092-8dbc-4fb0-a898-35a7c75c30d4
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn! Choose a skill:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            
            # Foe Choice Phase

                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, foe_skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            self._execute_skill(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill)
            if self.opponent_creature.hp > 0:
                self._execute_skill(self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill)

            # Equal speed: randomly decide who goes first
            first_attacker, first_defender, first_skill, second_skill = random.choice([
                (self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill),
                (self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature, foe_skill, player_skill)
            ])
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{first_attacker.display_name} moves first!")
            self._execute_skill(first_attacker, first_defender, first_skill)

        final_damage = int(weakness_factor * raw_damage)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - final_damage)
        
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_weakness_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        if skill_type == defender_type:
            return 1
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "fire") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "water"):
            return 2
        elif (skill_type == "fire" and defender_type == "water") or \
             (skill_type == "water" and defender_type == "leaf") or \
             (skill_type == "leaf" and defender_type == "fire"):

        else:
            return 1

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle("You lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._end_battle("You won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _end_battle(self, result_message):
        self._show_text(self.player, result_message)
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This implementation now correctly handles the case when creatures have equal speed by randomly deciding which creature goes first. The change is made within the `_resolution_phase` method, maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are already properly defined as pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

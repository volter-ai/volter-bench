## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that the `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` are not imported in the `main.py` file. To fix this, we need to import these scenes in the `main.py` file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add the necessary imports to the `main.py` file.
2. We'll ensure that all required modules are imported correctly.

Let's rewrite the `main.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 9f97be47-6872-44da-bac3-8e6e19bc479a
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution addresses the NameError by importing the necessary scene classes. We've added imports for `MainMenuScene` and `MainGameScene` from their respective modules. We've also included imports for `AbstractApp`, `HumanListener`, and `BotListener` from the engine library, as well as the `Player` model from our game's models.

These changes should resolve the NameError and allow the tests to run without the import-related errors. The rest of the implementation remains the same, maintaining the structure and guidelines for the models and architecture within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

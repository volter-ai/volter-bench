## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the game ends.
2. There are warnings about unserializable attributes in the MainGameScene, specifically the turn_queue.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition to the MainMenuScene or call quit_whole_game when the battle ends.
2. We'll remove the turn_queue as an attribute of the MainGameScene and instead use it as a local variable within the game loop.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene to implement these fixes:

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")

    def __str__(self):

```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Moving the `turn_queue` to be a local variable within the `game_loop` method, which resolves the unserializable attribute warnings.
2. Adding a transition to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends and creatures are reset, which ensures the scene properly exits.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and warnings while maintaining the game's functionality and adhering to the engine's capabilities and architecture guidelines.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

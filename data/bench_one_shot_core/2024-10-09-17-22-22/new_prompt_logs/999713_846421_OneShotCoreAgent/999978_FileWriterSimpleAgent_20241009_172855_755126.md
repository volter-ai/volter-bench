## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not properly exiting or transitioning to another scene when the game ends.
2. The turn_queue attribute in MainGameScene is causing serialization warnings.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the game loop to transition back to the MainMenuScene when the battle ends (either when a player wins or loses).
2. We'll remove the turn_queue attribute from the MainGameScene class and instead use a local variable within the game loop method.

These changes will stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the existing architecture. We don't need to modify the models, as the issue is with the scene logic.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these fixes:

```

These changes address both issues:

1. We've added a transition back to the MainMenuScene at the end of the game_loop method, ensuring that the scene properly exits when the battle ends.
2. We've removed the turn_queue as a class attribute and instead use it as a local variable within the game_loop method. This should resolve the serialization warnings.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they were not the source of the issues.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

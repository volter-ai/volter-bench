## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. How to fix the issues:

   a. Update the damage calculation formulas to match the specifications exactly.
   b. Adjust terminology to be consistent with the architecture documents.
   c. Modify the handling of equal speed scenarios to ensure it matches the specified requirements.

2. We need to rewrite the MainGameScene file to address these issues. Here's the rewritten file:

# Excerpt ID: af9fa2e5-29a3-4b27-a2c0-3b094c155ac7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, create_from_game_database
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS

"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self._show_text(self.player, str(self))
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self._opponent_choice_phase()
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)
            
            if self._check_battle_end():
                self._reset_creatures()
                self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
                break

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Your skills:\n{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}")
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

    def _opponent_choice_phase(self):

        return next(skill for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if second.hp > 0:
            self._execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def _determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker, defender, skill)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage to {defender.display_name}!")

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_resistance_factor = self._get_weakness_resistance_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        final_damage = int(weakness_resistance_factor * raw_damage)
        return final_damage

    def _get_weakness_resistance_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            "normal": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 1, "leaf": 1},
            "fire": {"normal": 1, "fire": 1, "water": 0.5, "leaf": 2},
            "water": {"normal": 1, "fire": 2, "water": 1, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"normal": 1, "fire": 0.5, "water": 2, "leaf": 1}
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}, you have lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"Congratulations {self.player.display_name}, you have won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues raised:

1. The damage calculation formulas have been updated to match the specifications exactly. The physical and special damage calculations are now separate, and the final damage is calculated using the weakness-resistance factor as specified.

2. Terminology has been adjusted to be consistent with the architecture documents. For example, "type_factor" has been renamed to "weakness_resistance_factor".

3. The handling of equal speed scenarios has been modified to use `random.sample` instead of `random.choice`, ensuring that either creature has an equal chance of being picked to go first, as specified in the requirements.

4. The structure of the _calculate_damage method now clearly shows the two-pass calculation process as described in the architecture.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. How to fix the issues:

   a. Add the welcome message to the MainMenuScene's __str__ method.
   b. In MainGameScene, explicitly show available skills before each choice.
   c. Remove the round() function from special attacks damage calculation.
   d. Add a check to ensure both creatures are alive before the second attack.
   e. Add the 'normal' type to the type effectiveness chart.
   f. Remove the additional feature of limiting battles to 3 in MainMenuScene.

2. We need to rewrite both the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene files to address these issues. Here are the rewritten files:

```

These changes address all the issues raised:

1. The welcome message is now included in the MainMenuScene's __str__ method.
2. In MainGameScene, available skills are explicitly shown before each choice.
3. The round() function has been removed from special attacks damage calculation.
4. A check has been added to ensure both creatures are alive before the second attack.
5. The 'normal' type has been added to the type effectiveness chart.
6. The additional feature of limiting battles to 3 in MainMenuScene has been removed.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are already pure data schemas without methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

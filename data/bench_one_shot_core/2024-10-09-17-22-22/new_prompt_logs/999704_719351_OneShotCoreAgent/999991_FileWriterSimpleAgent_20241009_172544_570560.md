## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting after the battle ends. We need to transition to another scene or quit the game when the battle is over.

2. The whole game flow test is failing because the game is not properly ending after the MainGameScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll add a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This will allow the player to choose to play again or quit the game.

2. We'll update the MainMenuScene to include an option to quit the game, ensuring that the whole game flow can properly end.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene and MainMenuScene files with these changes:

```python main_game/scenes/main_menu_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button

class MainMenuScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)

    def __str__(self):

    def run(self):
        while True:
            play_button = Button("Play")
            quit_button = Button("Quit")
            choices = [play_button, quit_button]
            choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)

            if play_button == choice:

            elif quit_button == choice:
                self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes should resolve the issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we've added an `end_battle` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends. This ensures that the scene doesn't terminate without transitioning or quitting.

2. The MainMenuScene now includes a "Quit" option that calls `_quit_whole_game()` when selected. This allows the player to properly exit the game, which should fix the whole game flow test.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and model structure while addressing the specific issues raised in the test failures. The game now has a complete loop: Main Menu -> Battle -> Main Menu -> Quit, which should satisfy the requirements for proper scene transitions and game termination.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

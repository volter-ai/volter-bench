## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The game is not properly ending or transitioning to a new scene after a battle concludes.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends. This will ensure that the game loop continues and the scene exits properly. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the main menu after a battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `run` method to continue the game loop until a transition occurs.
3. We'll update the `_battle_round` method to return a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended.

Now, let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f3c8535a-8787-4aac-af56-ff3528345e53
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
VS
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

{self._format_skills(self.player_creature.skills)}
"""

    def _format_skills(self, skills):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle start!")
        battle_ended = False
        while not battle_ended:
            battle_ended = self._battle_round()
        self._reset_creatures()
        self._return_to_main_menu()

    def _battle_round(self):
        player_skill = self._player_choice_phase()
        opponent_skill = self._opponent_choice_phase()
        return self._resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

    def _player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return next(skill for skill in self.player_creature.skills if skill.display_name == choice.display_name)

    def _opponent_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [Button(skill.display_name) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self._determine_order()
        for attacker, defender, skill in [(first, second, player_skill if first == self.player else opponent_skill),
                                          (second, first, opponent_skill if first == self.player else player_skill)]:
            damage = self._calculate_damage(attacker.creatures[0], defender.creatures[0], skill)
            defender.creatures[0].hp = max(0, defender.creatures[0].hp - damage)
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker.creatures[0].display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender.creatures[0].display_name} took {damage} damage!")
            
            if defender.creatures[0].hp == 0:
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name}'s {defender.creatures[0].display_name} fainted!")
                self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} wins!")
                return True
        return False

    def _determine_order(self):
        if self.player_creature.speed > self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.player, self.opponent
        elif self.player_creature.speed < self.opponent_creature.speed:
            return self.opponent, self.player
        else:
            return random.sample([self.player, self.opponent], 2)

    def _calculate_damage(self, attacker: Creature, defender: Creature, skill: Skill):
        if skill.is_physical:
            raw_damage = attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense
        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker.sp_attack / defender.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage
        
        type_factor = self._get_type_factor(skill.skill_type, defender.creature_type)
        return int(raw_damage * type_factor)

    def _get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):
        effectiveness = {
            ("fire", "leaf"): 2,
            ("fire", "water"): 0.5,
            ("water", "fire"): 2,
            ("water", "leaf"): 0.5,
            ("leaf", "water"): 2,
            ("leaf", "fire"): 0.5
        }
        return effectiveness.get((skill_type, defender_type), 1)

    def _reset_creatures(self):
        for creature in self.player.creatures + self.opponent.creatures:
            creature.hp = creature.max_hp

    def _return_to_main_menu(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes should resolve the issues by ensuring that:

1. The MainGameScene properly exits by calling `_transition_to_scene` to return to the MainMenuScene after a battle ends.
2. The game loop in the `run` method continues until a battle has ended, preventing premature exits.
3. The `_battle_round` method now returns a boolean indicating whether the battle has ended, allowing the main loop to continue or exit as appropriate.

With these modifications, the scene should exit properly, and the game should continue running or exit gracefully as expected.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

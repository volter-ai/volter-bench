## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issues raised during QA/testing. I'll address these concerns by modifying the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how I plan to fix the issues:

1. Handle equal speed for skill execution order:
   - We'll modify the _resolve_turn method to use random.shuffle when speeds are equal.

2. Use floats throughout damage calculations:
   - We'll update the _execute_skill method to use floats for all calculations until the final damage is determined.

3. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   - We'll add a new method _check_and_swap_fainted_creature to handle this logic.
   - We'll call this method after each skill execution and at the start of each player's turn.

Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes implemented:

These changes address the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Equal speed for skill execution is now handled by shuffling actions with equal speed.
2. Damage calculations now use floats throughout, only converting to an integer for the final damage value.
3. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented with the _check_and_swap_fainted_creature method, which is called after each attack and at the start of each turn.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the architecture where models are pure data schemas. All game logic is handled within the MainGameScene class, keeping the models clean and free of methods or properties.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

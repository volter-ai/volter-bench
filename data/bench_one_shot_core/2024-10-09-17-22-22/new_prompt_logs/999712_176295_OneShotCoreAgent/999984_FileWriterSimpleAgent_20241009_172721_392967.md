## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue where we're encountering a `NoneType` error when trying to access `skill.base_damage`, we need to ensure that a skill is always selected before the resolution phase. The error occurs because sometimes the player or opponent turn doesn't set a skill before the resolution phase begins. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. Initialize the `player_skill` and `opponent_skill` with a default skill in the `__init__` method.
2. Modify the `player_turn` and `opponent_turn` methods to always set a skill, even if the player chooses to quit.
3. Add a check in the `resolution_phase` to ensure both skills are set before proceeding.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: bc75a013-14f4-4dbc-a78b-6ec3dbddd133
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = self._app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        # Initialize with default skills
        self.player_skill = self.player_creature.skills[0]
        self.opponent_skill = self.opponent_creature.skills[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

        elif quit_button == choice:
            self._quit_whole_game()
        # If we reach here, it means the player didn't quit, so we ensure a skill is set

```

These changes address the `NoneType` error by ensuring that both the player and opponent always have a skill selected before the resolution phase. We've made the following key modifications:

1. Initialized `player_skill` and `opponent_skill` with default values in the `__init__` method.
2. Modified the `player_turn` method to set a random skill if the player chooses to quit or if no skill was selected for some reason.
3. Added a check in the `resolution_phase` to ensure both skills are set before proceeding.
4. Reset the skills to `None` at the end of each resolution phase to ensure new skills are selected in the next turn.

These changes should resolve the `NoneType` error while maintaining the game's logic and adhering to the engine's capabilities and architecture.

## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly after the battle ends.
2. The whole game flow is not transitioning correctly after the MainGameScene ends.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the MainGameScene, we'll modify the `check_battle_end` method to transition to the MainMenuScene or quit the game after the battle ends.
2. We'll ensure that the battle loop in MainGameScene continues until the battle ends, and then properly exits the scene.

Let's rewrite the `main_game_scene.py` file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 835fe55c-011c-44d2-8240-7657bb5b5d18
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Your turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            opponent_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, opponent_skill)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.opponent_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill, opponent_skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature)
        first_skill = player_skill if first == self.player_creature else opponent_skill
        second_skill = opponent_skill if first == self.player_creature else player_skill

        self.execute_skill(first, second, first_skill)
        if not self.check_battle_end():
            self.execute_skill(second, first, second_skill)

    def determine_order(self, creature1, creature2):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return creature1, creature2
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return creature2, creature1
        else:
            return random.sample([creature1, creature2], 2)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker, defender, skill):
        damage = max(0, attacker.attack + skill.base_damage - defender.defense)
        defender.hp = max(0, defender.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.end_battle()
            return True
        return False

    def end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Battle ended!")
        play_again = Button("Play Again")
        quit_game = Button("Quit Game")
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [play_again, quit_game])
        
        if choice == play_again:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        else:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

These changes ensure that:

1. The battle loop continues until a creature faints.
2. When the battle ends, the player is given a choice to play again or quit the game.
3. Based on the player's choice, the scene either transitions back to the MainMenuScene or quits the whole game.

This should resolve both issues:
- The MainGameScene will now exit properly after the battle ends.
- The whole game flow will transition correctly after the MainGameScene ends.

These modifications adhere to the engine's capabilities and maintain the existing architecture. The models remain unchanged, as they are already correctly implemented as pure data schemas inheriting from AbstractThing or AbstractPlayer.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

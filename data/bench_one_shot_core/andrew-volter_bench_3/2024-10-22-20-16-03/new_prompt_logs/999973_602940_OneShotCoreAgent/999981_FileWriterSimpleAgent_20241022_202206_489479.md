## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the detailed feedback. I'll address each of the issues raised and propose solutions that align with the specified architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Replace `attacker.creatures[0]` with `self.player_creature` or `self.opponent_creature` as appropriate.
b) Explicitly handle the 'normal' type in the weakness-resistance factor calculation.
c) Ensure damage calculation doesn't result in negative values.
d) Modify the `reset_creatures` method to reset only the player's and opponent's current creatures.

These changes will be implemented in the `MainGameScene` class within the `main_game_scene.py` file. No changes to the models are required, as these are purely logic adjustments within the scene.

2. Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: 655e294d-ff59-41a3-9a3f-2dd4c4a6a5ae
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}: {self.player_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp})
{self.opponent.display_name}: {self.opponent_creature.display_name} (HP: {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp})

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"Battle start! {self.player.display_name} vs {self.opponent.display_name}")

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

        self.reset_creatures()

            return (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature), (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature)
        else:
            if random.random() < 0.5:
                return (self.player, player_skill, self.opponent_creature), (self.opponent, opponent_skill, self.player_creature)
            else:

        else:
            raw_damage = (attacker_creature.sp_attack / defender_creature.sp_defense) * skill.base_damage

        weakness_factor = self.calculate_weakness_factor(skill.skill_type, defender_creature.creature_type)
        final_damage = max(0, int(weakness_factor * raw_damage))  # Ensure non-negative damage

        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - final_damage)

            "water": {"fire": 2, "leaf": 0.5},
            "leaf": {"water": 2, "fire": 0.5},
            "normal": {}  # Normal type is neither effective nor ineffective against any type
        }
        return effectiveness.get(skill_type, {}).get(defender_type, 1)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} lost the battle!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name} won the battle!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. We've replaced `attacker.creatures[0]` with `attacker_creature`, which is correctly set to either `self.player_creature` or `self.opponent_creature`.
2. The `calculate_weakness_factor` method now explicitly handles the 'normal' type, which has no effectiveness or ineffectiveness against any type.
3. The damage calculation now uses `max(0, int(weakness_factor * raw_damage))` to ensure non-negative values.
4. The `reset_creatures` method now only resets the HP of the player's and opponent's current creatures, rather than all creatures.

These modifications maintain the existing architecture and model structure, and they don't introduce any new methods or properties to the data models. The game logic remains within the scene, and the models continue to be pure data schemas.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

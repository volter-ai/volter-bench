## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose a solution that adheres to the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. To fix the issues:

   a) Equal speed resolution: We'll implement a random tie-breaker when creatures have equal speed.
   b) Float calculations: We'll ensure that all damage calculations use floats until the final step.
   c) Forced swapping: We'll implement a method to handle forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero.

2. We need to modify the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's the rewritten file with the proposed solutions:

# Excerpt ID: d55fce28-9012-4ad9-ab67-af42cfc3c43f

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        player_creature = self.player.active_creature
        opponent_creature = self.opponent.active_creature

This updated implementation addresses all the issues raised:

1. Equal speed resolution: In the `_resolution_phase` method, we've added a random tie-breaker when sorting the turn queue. This ensures that when creatures have equal speed, the order is randomly determined.

2. Float calculations: We've updated the `_execute_skill` method to use float calculations throughout the damage calculation process. The final damage is only converted to an integer at the very end.

3. Forced swapping: We've implemented the `_check_knocked_out` and `_force_swap` methods. After each action in the `_resolution_phase`, we check if any creature has been knocked out. If so, we force the player to swap to another creature if they have any available.

These changes maintain the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

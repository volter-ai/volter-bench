## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

1. To fix these issues, we'll need to modify the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file. Here's how we'll address each problem:

   a) Equal speed resolution: We'll modify the _resolution_phase method to randomly determine the order when speeds are equal.
   
   b) Forced swapping: We'll implement a new method _check_and_swap_fainted_creature that will be called after each attack.
   
   c) 'Normal' type neutrality: We'll update the _get_type_factor method to explicitly handle the 'Normal' type.

2. Here's the rewritten main_game_scene.py file with these changes implemented:

```

These changes address all three issues:

1. Equal speed resolution is now implemented in the _resolution_phase method. When two actions have the same speed, their order is randomly determined.

2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the new _check_and_swap_fainted_creature method. This method is called after each attack in the _resolution_phase.

3. The 'Normal' type being neutral against all other types is now explicitly handled in the _get_type_factor method.

These modifications stay within the capabilities of the engine and maintain the separation of concerns between models and game logic. The models remain pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the MainGameScene class.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

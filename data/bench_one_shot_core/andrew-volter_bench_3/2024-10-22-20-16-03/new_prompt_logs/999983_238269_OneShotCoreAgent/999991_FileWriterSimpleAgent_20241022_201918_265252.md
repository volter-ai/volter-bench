## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The error occurs because `player_skill` and `foe_skill` are not passed to the `determine_order` method. We'll make the following changes:

1. Update the `determine_order` method to accept the skills as parameters.
2. Modify the `resolution_phase` method to pass the skills to `determine_order`.
3. Update the return values in `determine_order` to include the skills.

These changes will ensure that the skills are properly passed and used throughout the battle logic, while staying within the capabilities of the engine and maintaining the existing architecture.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 54ebba2f-d26e-42b7-ac2b-d82efe06fd98
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self, player: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self, opponent: Player, creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=f"Use {skill.display_name}") for skill in creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(opponent, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        first, second = self.determine_order(self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature, player_skill, foe_skill)
        
        self.execute_skill(first[0], first[1], second[1], first[2])
        if self.check_battle_end():
            return
        
        self.execute_skill(second[0], second[1], first[1], second[2])

    def determine_order(self, creature1: Creature, creature2: Creature, skill1: Skill, skill2: Skill):
        if creature1.speed > creature2.speed:
            return (self.player, creature1, skill1), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2)
        elif creature2.speed > creature1.speed:
            return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2), (self.player, creature1, skill1)
        else:
            if random.choice([True, False]):
                return (self.player, creature1, skill1), (self.opponent, creature2, skill2)
            else:
                return (self.opponent, creature2, skill2), (self.player, creature1, skill1)

    def execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, attacker_creature: Creature, defender_creature: Creature, skill: Skill):
        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name} and dealt {damage} damage!")

    def check_battle_end(self) -> bool:
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted. You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted. You win!")
            return True
        return False
```

This updated version of the `MainGameScene` class should resolve the NameError issues by properly passing the `player_skill` and `foe_skill` to the `determine_order` method. The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

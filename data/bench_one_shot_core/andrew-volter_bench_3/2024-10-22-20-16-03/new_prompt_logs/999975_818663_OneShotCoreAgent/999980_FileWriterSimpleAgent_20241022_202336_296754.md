## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised during QA/testing, I will make the following changes to the MainGameScene class in the main_game_scene.py file:

1. Implement random resolution for equal speed:
   In the _resolution_phase method, we'll add a random factor to the sorting key for creatures with equal speed.

2. Implement forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
   We'll add a new method _check_and_swap_fainted_creature that will be called after each attack in the _perform_attack method.

3. Explicitly handle Normal type neutrality:
   We'll update the _get_type_factor method to explicitly return 1 for Normal type skills.

4. Explicitly convert damage from float to integer:
   In the _calculate_damage method, we'll use math.floor to convert the final damage to an integer.

Here's the updated main_game_scene.py file with these changes implemented:

```

These changes address all the issues raised in the QA testing:

1. Equal speed resolution is now implemented randomly by adding a random factor to the sorting key in the _resolution_phase method.
2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the new _check_and_swap_fainted_creature method, which is called after each attack in the _perform_attack method.
3. Normal type neutrality is explicitly handled in the _get_type_factor method, always returning 1 for Normal type skills.
4. The conversion of damage from float to integer is now explicitly done using math.floor in the _calculate_damage method.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the overall structure and functionality of the game as specified in the architecture description.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. The problem is that the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes are not imported in the main.py file. To fix this, we need to import these scene classes in the main.py file. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. We'll modify the main.py file to import the necessary scene classes from their respective modules.
2. We'll ensure that all other necessary imports are present.
3. We'll keep the App class implementation as it is, just adding the missing imports.

Here's the rewritten main.py file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 7863799f-cdcb-4cbf-9112-77666f2fea21
```python main_game/main.py
import uuid
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractApp, HumanListener, BotListener
from main_game.models import Player
from main_game.scenes.main_menu_scene import MainMenuScene
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class App(AbstractApp):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.register_scene("MainMenuScene", MainMenuScene, is_entry_point=True)
        self.register_scene("MainGameScene", MainGameScene)

    def create_player(self, player_id: str):
        player = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id="default_player")
        player.uid = player_id
        player.set_listener(HumanListener())
        return player

    def create_bot(self, prototype_id: str):
        bot = Player.from_prototype_id(prototype_id=prototype_id)
        bot.uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
        bot.set_listener(BotListener())
        return bot


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app = App()
    app.run(app.create_player("just_a_guy"))
```

This solution addresses the NameError by importing the MainMenuScene and MainGameScene classes from their respective modules. It also ensures that all other necessary imports are present, including the AbstractApp, HumanListener, and BotListener from the engine library, as well as the Player model from the game's models.

The App class implementation remains the same, but now it can correctly reference the imported scene classes when registering them.

This change should resolve the NameError and allow the tests to run without the import-related errors. The game's architecture and model structure remain unchanged, staying within the capabilities of the engine and adhering to the guidelines for models and scenes.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

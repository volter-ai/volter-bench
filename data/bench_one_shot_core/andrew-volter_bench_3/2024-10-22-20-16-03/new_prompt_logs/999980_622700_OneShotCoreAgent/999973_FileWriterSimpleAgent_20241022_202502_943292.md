## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for providing the QA feedback. I'll address each of the issues and propose solutions that align with the architecture and stay within the engine's capabilities.

1. To resolve equal speed scenarios, we'll add a random tiebreaker in the resolution phase.
2. We'll ensure that float calculations are used throughout the damage calculation process.
3. We'll add an explicit message for the losing player at the end of the battle.

These changes will be implemented in the MainGameScene. Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the _resolution_phase method, we'll modify the sorting key to include a random tiebreaker for equal speeds.
2. In the _execute_skill method, we'll ensure all calculations use floats until the final damage is calculated.
3. In the _check_battle_end method, we'll add separate messages for the winner and loser.

Now, let's rewrite the main_game_scene.py file with these changes:

These changes address the issues raised in the QA feedback:

1. The resolution of equal speed scenarios is now implemented with a random tiebreaker in the _resolution_phase method.
2. Float calculations are now used throughout the damage calculation process in the _execute_skill method.
3. Explicit messages for both the winning and losing players are now shown at the end of the battle in the _check_battle_end method.

The changes maintain the existing architecture and stay within the capabilities of the engine. The models remain unchanged, as they are still pure data schemas without methods or properties. The MainGameScene continues to handle all the game logic, including the battle system and turn resolution.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

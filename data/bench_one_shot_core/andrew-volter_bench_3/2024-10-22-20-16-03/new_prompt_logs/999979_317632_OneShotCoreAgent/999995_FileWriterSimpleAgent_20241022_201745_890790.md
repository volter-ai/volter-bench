## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the MainGameScene, the scene is not exiting properly, which causes the test to fail because neither `_transition_to_scene` nor `_quit_whole_game` is called.

2. The whole game flow test is failing because the MainGameScene is not properly ending the game or transitioning to another scene.

To fix these issues, we'll modify the MainGameScene to properly end the game or transition to another scene when the battle ends. Here's how we'll do it:

1. We'll add a method to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll modify the `_check_battle_end` method to call this new transition method.
3. We'll ensure that the `run` method continues to loop until the battle ends.

Here's the rewritten MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: ce350896-8729-4525-a1d3-6c89e0309b92
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.opponent = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.player_creature = player.creatures[0]
        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name}: HP {self.opponent_creature.hp}/{self.opponent_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.opponent_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        while not self.battle_ended:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.player, self.player_creature)
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self._player_choice_phase(self.opponent, self.opponent_creature)
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self._resolution_phase(player_skill, foe_skill)
            
            # Check for battle end
            self._check_battle_end()

    def _player_choice_phase(self, current_player: Player, current_creature: Creature) -> Skill:
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in current_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(current_player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def _resolution_phase(self, player_skill: Skill, foe_skill: Skill):
        if self.player_creature.speed >= self.opponent_creature.speed:
            first_attacker, second_attacker = self.player, self.opponent
            first_skill, second_skill = player_skill, foe_skill
        else:
            first_attacker, second_attacker = self.opponent, self.player
            first_skill, second_skill = foe_skill, player_skill

        self._execute_skill(first_attacker, first_skill)
        if not self.battle_ended:
            self._execute_skill(second_attacker, second_skill)

    def _execute_skill(self, attacker: Player, skill: Skill):
        if attacker == self.player:
            attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.player_creature, self.opponent_creature
        else:
            attacker_creature, defender_creature = self.opponent_creature, self.player_creature

        damage = attacker_creature.attack + skill.base_damage - defender_creature.defense
        defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp - damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker.display_name}'s {attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
        self._show_text(self.player, f"{defender_creature.display_name} took {damage} damage!")

    def _check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            self._end_battle()
        elif self.opponent_creature.hp <= 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.opponent.display_name}'s {self.opponent_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            self.battle_ended = True
            self._end_battle()

    def _end_battle(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, "Returning to the main menu...")
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a `battle_ended` flag to properly control the main game loop.
2. Modifying the `_check_battle_end` method to set the `battle_ended` flag and call a new `_end_battle` method.
3. Adding an `_end_battle` method that transitions back to the MainMenuScene, ensuring that the scene always exits properly.

These modifications should resolve both test failures:

1. The MainGameScene test should now pass because the scene will properly exit by calling `_transition_to_scene`.
2. The whole game flow test should also pass because the MainGameScene will now properly end and return to the main menu.

These changes maintain the existing architecture and model structure while fixing the identified issues within the capabilities of the engine.

## Proposed Code Change
Thank you for bringing these issues to my attention. I'll address each of the problems and propose solutions that align with the architecture and engine capabilities.

1. Fixing the issues:

a) Equal speed resolution:
We'll modify the _resolution_phase method in MainGameScene to implement random resolution when creatures have equal speed.

b) Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero:
We'll add a new method _check_and_swap_fainted_creature to handle forced swapping after each attack.

c) Normal type being neutral against all types:
We'll update the _get_type_factor method to explicitly handle the normal type.

2. Rewriting the MainGameScene file with the proposed solutions:

```

These changes address all three issues:

1. Equal speed resolution is now implemented randomly in the _resolution_phase method.
2. Forced swapping when a creature's HP reaches zero is implemented in the new _check_and_swap_fainted_creature method, which is called after each attack in the _resolution_phase.
3. The normal type being neutral against all types is explicitly handled in the _get_type_factor method.

The implementation stays within the capabilities of the engine and maintains the architecture described in the original requirements. The models remain as pure data schemas, and all game logic is contained within the scene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
To address the issues raised in the QA report, we need to make two main changes:

1. Implement random decision for equal speed in battle.
2. Add an explicit welcome message at the start of the MainMenuScene.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we'll modify the `resolution_phase` method to use a random decision when the speeds are equal.
2. In the `MainMenuScene`, we'll add a welcome message at the beginning of the `run` method.

Let's rewrite the necessary files with these changes:

```

These changes address the issues raised in the QA report:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, we've modified the `resolution_phase` method to use a random decision when the speeds are equal. This is implemented using `random.choice([True, False])` to decide which creature goes first when their speeds are the same.

2. In the `MainMenuScene`, we've added a welcome message at the beginning of the `run` method using `self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to Creature Battler! Get ready for exciting battles!")`. This ensures that players see an explicit welcome message when they start the game.

These modifications should resolve the issues while maintaining the existing architecture and staying within the capabilities of the engine. The core functionality of the game remains intact, and we've addressed the minor discrepancies noted in the QA report.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

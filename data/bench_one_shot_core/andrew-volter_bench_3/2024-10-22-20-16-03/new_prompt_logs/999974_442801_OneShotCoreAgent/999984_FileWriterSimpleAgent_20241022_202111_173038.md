## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. In the `MainGameScene`, the scene is not properly exiting by calling either `_transition_to_scene` or `_quit_whole_game`.
2. The random test runs are not completing as expected, likely due to the scene not properly transitioning or quitting.

To resolve these issues, we'll modify the `MainGameScene` to properly exit after the battle ends. We'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after displaying the battle result. This approach will ensure that the scene always exits in an expected manner and allows for multiple battles if the player chooses to play again.

Here's how we'll fix the `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file:

1. We'll modify the `run` method to include a loop that allows for multiple battles.
2. After each battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
3. We'll ensure that all possible paths in the scene lead to either a transition or quitting the game.

Here's the rewritten `main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

        self.opponent_creature = self.opponent.creatures[0]

    def get_type_factor(self, skill_type, defender_type):

        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.opponent_creature.hp = self.opponent_creature.max_hp
```

This revised implementation addresses the issues by:

1. Introducing a main loop in the `run` method that allows for multiple battles.
2. Properly handling the end of each battle by offering the player a choice to play again or quit.
3. Ensuring that all paths in the scene lead to either a transition (implicitly, by starting a new battle) or quitting the game.
4. Maintaining the existing battle logic while improving the overall flow of the game.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the `MainGameScene` always exits in an expected manner, either by transitioning to a new battle or quitting the game entirely.

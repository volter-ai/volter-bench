## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue of not explicitly prioritizing swaps over skills in the `resolve_turn` method, I will modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. Here's how I will fix the issue:

1. Modify the `resolve_turn` method to separate swap actions from attack actions.
2. Process all swap actions first, then process all attack actions.
3. Maintain the speed-based ordering within each action type.

This approach will ensure that swaps are always prioritized over skills while still respecting the speed of the creatures for determining the order within each action type.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: b0e8004c-46b5-4d95-88b6-6dcb67e820a0
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        self.turn_counter = 0
        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
```

This solution explicitly prioritizes swaps over skills in the `resolve_turn` method while maintaining the speed-based ordering within each action type. The `resolve_turn` method now separates swap actions from attack actions, processes all swaps first, and then processes all attacks. This ensures that the implementation follows the requirement specified in the architecture documentation.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

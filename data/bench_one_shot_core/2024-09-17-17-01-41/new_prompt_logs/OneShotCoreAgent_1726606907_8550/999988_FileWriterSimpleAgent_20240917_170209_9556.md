## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The problem is that the scene is terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. We'll address this by adding a transition back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends.

Here's how we'll fix it:

1. In the `check_battle_end` method, instead of just returning True when the battle ends, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.
2. We'll remove the `return True` statements from `check_battle_end` and instead use a flag to break the main game loop.
3. After the main game loop, we'll transition back to the `MainMenuScene`.

This approach ensures that the scene always transitions or quits, following the engine's requirements.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: 109786c0-1a50-449a-8e5d-1d23f72938ca
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        self.player.active_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot.active_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.battle_ended = False

            self._show_text(self.player, "You won the battle!")
            self.battle_ended = True
```

This solution ensures that the `MainGameScene` always transitions back to the `MainMenuScene` after the battle ends, addressing the issue of the scene terminating without calling `quit_whole_game` or transitioning to another scene. The main game loop now uses a `battle_ended` flag to determine when to exit, and after exiting the loop, it transitions back to the `MainMenuScene`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

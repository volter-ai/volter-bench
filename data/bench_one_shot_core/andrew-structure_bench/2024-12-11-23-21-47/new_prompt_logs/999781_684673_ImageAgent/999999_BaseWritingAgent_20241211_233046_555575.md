The appearance doc should have the following sections:

1. exhaustive description of the overall style and look of the assets in the game. Discuss how to communicate the unique setting and tone of the game through these assets. For different characters who have similar roles, design iconic uniforms so the characters' outfits will be similar and recognizable (e.g. school students, police, soldiers, etc.)

2. each asset should have 3 sections: a) first describe the character or location's appearance in words b) then describe the strategy of how keywords will be selected to communicate that appearance to the AI (see the prompting guidelines) c) finally write the positive and negative prompts



Here are some examples of characters:

positive_prompt: "high quality, 1girl, summer dress, blonde hair, medium breasts, green eyes, straw hat, long hair, white shoes, high heels, simple background, full body, looking at viewer, solo, standing"

negative_prompt: "low quality, bad anatomy, text, watermark, signature, copyright notice, background, outline, scars, chibi, child, rating_explicit"



positive_prompt: "high quality, 1girl, simple background, solo, full body, facing to the side, (standing:0.1), solo, black hair, multicolored hair, blue highlights, reverse bob, white crop top, sandals, gold eyes, looking at viewer, blue shorts, medium breasts, white sneakers, hand on hip"

negative_prompt: "low quality, bad anatomy, text, watermark, signature, copyright notice, background, outline, scars, chibi, child, rating_explicit"



positive_prompt: 1girl, solo, full body, standing, fighting stance, (facing to the side), looking afar, small breasts, black uniform, police uniform, black dress, belt, blue eyeliner, blue eyeshadow, mechanical limbs, android girl, metal skin, blonde hair, long hair, pink highlights, side braid, multicolored hair, pink eyes, (+_+: 1.3), wrist cuffs, robotic legs, mechanical legs, expressionless, portrait, black background, blue necktie



Here are some examples of locations:

positive_prompt: "score_9, score_8_up, score_7_up, score_6_up, bedroom, bookshelves, morning, floor lamp, neatly folded bed, desk, notes, blue curtains, white sheets, blue carpet, background",

negative_prompt: "watermark, signature, 1girl, 1boy, human, people, person, artist name, (3d), realistic"



Character prompting guidelines:

1. All the positive prompts should have (1boy) or (1girl) depending on gender. Make sure to keep the parenthesis for emphasis. If the character is male also add mature male

2. All terms must be explicit descriptions of visible and objective features such as "square jaw" instead of "masculine"

3. Use explicit and objectively visible keywords such as "white hair", "metallic leg" instead of abstract or general descriptions such as "old" or "mechanical"

4. Use explicit and objectively visible keywords such as "furrowed brow", "scar" or "big eyes" instead of personality descriptions such as "stern", "authoritative", or "naive"

5. Use multiple descriptions of the same thing to make sure the image gen AI gets it 

6. Include exhaustive details about clothing, facial features, hair and hairstyle, and accessories 

7. Include explicit description of the pose and must include "solo, full body, standing, looking at viewer". All characters must have the same pose for similarity

8. If the character is wearing a uniform (school, navy, etc.) all the characters who have the same uniform should have the same clothing description for the uniform (although different characters can potentially wear unique accessories to standout)



Location prompting guidelines:

1. All positive prompts should start with "scenery, no humans" end with "minimal, anime style, solid colors, background"

2. All terms must be explicit descriptions of visible and objective features such as "cage" instead of "dangerous"

3. Use explicit and objectively visible keywords such as "rusty metal" instead of abstract or general descriptions such as "old" or "mechanical"

4. Locations are different from characters, there should be at most 4 different objects we expect to see in the scene

5. All negative prompts must include: lowres, low quality, text, signature, watermark, copyright notice, realistic, 1girl, 1boy, people, person



Guidelines:

1. For characters, do not describe the variations. All the variations will be generated from a single asset

2. Just do characters and locations first, we will come back to other stuff later



Make sure all the details from the description are included and expounded on in the overview



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



Do not use ``` inside the content of the markdown file you write, because I use them to delimit the files



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

   - The characters will have detailed descriptions, and those with similar roles will wear iconic uniforms or share common design elements for easy recognition.
   - The locations will be depicted as atmospheric backgrounds with specific features to enhance the game's setting.

2. **For each asset (characters and locations), we will:**
   - **a) Describe the character or location's appearance in words:**
     - Provide detailed, explicit descriptions of visible and objective features such as clothing, facial features, hairstyles, accessories, and surroundings.
   - **b) Describe the strategy of how keywords will be selected to communicate that appearance to the AI:**
     - Follow the prompting guidelines to ensure that the AI generates images that match our descriptions.
     - Use explicit and objective keywords to describe visible features.
     - Include exhaustive details about the character's pose, clothing, facial features, hair, hairstyle, and accessories.
     - For characters, include "solo, full body, standing, looking at viewer" in the prompts for consistency.
     - For locations, limit to at most four objects in the scene.
   - **c) Write the positive and negative prompts:**
     - Construct positive prompts that include all the key descriptive elements.
     - Use negative prompts to exclude undesired elements, following the guidelines.

**Guidelines Followed:**

- Adhered to character and location prompting guidelines for constructing descriptions and prompts.
- Ensured that all characters have consistent poses and detailed descriptions.
- For characters with similar roles, designed common elements in their attire for recognition.
- Included all details from the descriptions in the overview.

# Appearance

## Overall Style and Look of the Assets

The game features a rich, immersive anime-style visual aesthetic that combines elements of mystery, sci-fi, and fantasy to create a unique and engaging atmosphere. Characters are rendered in high-quality, detailed anime art style with vibrant colors and expressive features that convey their personalities and emotions. The designs balance realism and stylization typical of modern anime, with attention to clothing details, hairstyles, and accessories that reflect their roles and backgrounds in the game's story.

Environments and locations are depicted as atmospheric backgrounds that enhance the mood and setting of each scene. The locations range from dark, enigmatic chambers to bustling city streets, each with distinctive features contributing to the overarching narrative's tone. The background art adopts a consistent anime style with solid colors and minimalistic designs to keep the focus on the characters while providing sufficient environmental context.

To communicate the unique setting and tone of the game, which blends mystery and futuristic elements, the assets incorporate motifs of shadows, light contrasts, and symbolic items. Characters who belong to the same groups or organizations wear iconic uniforms or share common design elements in their attire to make them easily recognizable and signify their affiliations. This includes uniform color schemes, emblems, or specific accessory types common among characters of similar roles, such as members of a mysterious organization or inhabitants of a particular realm.

The overall visual style aims to create an immersive and cohesive experience where both characters and settings contribute to the mysterious and engaging atmosphere of the game.

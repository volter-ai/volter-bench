General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise yet engaging summary of the game. It should capture the essence of the game, its genre, and a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics and story progression. I will focus on the unique aspects of the game, such as its visual novel style, the role of player choices, and the central theme of time manipulation.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, character backgrounds, story branches, and gameplay mechanics. I will draw from the provided game overview, plot summary, setting, and character descriptions to create a comprehensive and engaging narrative that informs potential players about what to expect from the game.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

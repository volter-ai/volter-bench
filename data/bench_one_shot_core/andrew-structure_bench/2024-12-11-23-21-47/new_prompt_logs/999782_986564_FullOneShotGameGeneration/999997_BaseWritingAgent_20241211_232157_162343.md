Role: user
Content: You should create the first two chapters of this visual novel. 

The first chapter should:

1. start with a short but intriguing attention grabbing event that gets the reader hooked, sets up the mystery but leaves many things mysterious

2. then, take the time to introduce the setting and the characters

3. end with a twist that surprises the reader and raises the stakes



The second chapter should:

1. follow through with the twist and heighten the action

2. introduce a completely new aspect to the world and a new character who changes the direction completely

3. ends on escalating action that makes the reader excited for the full game's release



Each node/scene should be given a unique name and each decision point should lead to the next node



The story should be broken into: chapters, scenes, and beats. All scenes and beats must have thematic names



Make sure to make use of the game's unique mechanics in the story



Fill out the `docs/chapters/chapter1.md` and `docs/chapters/chapter2.md` document. These docs should contain all the dialog, not just a summary. Focus on dialog and text between characters, each chapter must have at least 200 lines of dialog. Add exactly 4 decision points per chapter. That's one decision point in around 50 lines, and bring the dialog tree back together so that we don't have divergent choice trees. THe result of every choice must be continued in their own beat



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will write the story. Outline both chapters. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each chapter, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



```filetype filepath2

content2

```

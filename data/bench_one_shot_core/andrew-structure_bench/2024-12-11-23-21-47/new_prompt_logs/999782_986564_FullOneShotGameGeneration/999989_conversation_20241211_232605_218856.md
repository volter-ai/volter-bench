Issue Analysis:

The error shows that we're using an invalid variation "confused" for the alex sprite in multiple locations. This is the first time seeing this issue.

Root Cause Analysis:
1. In chapter1.js, we used "confused" as a variation in several dialog lines:
   - Line 1 in void/awakening beat: alex with "confused" variation
   - Line 4 in fork/soundPath beat: alex with "confused" variation
   - Line 0 in awakening/finalChoice beat: alex with "confused" variation

2. Looking at assetManifest.js, the only valid variations are:
```javascript
variations: ['neutral', 'happy', 'sad', 'embarrassed', 'crying', 'surprised', 'angry', 'thinking']
```

3. The error is thrown in assetUtils.js when it checks if the variation exists:
```javascript
if (!sprite.variations.includes(variation)) {
  throw new Error(`Invalid variation ${variation} for sprite ${spriteId}...`);
}
```

4. This is a problem with the content code, not the test. The test is correctly catching invalid variations.

5. Looking at the story context, "confused" was used when Alex is:
   - Waking up disoriented
   - Questioning the radio voice
   - Questioning their power

Solution:
We should replace "confused" with appropriate valid variations:
- For waking up disoriented: use "thinking"
- For questioning the radio voice: use "surprised"
- For questioning power: use "surprised"

These alternatives maintain the emotional intent while using valid variations.

Here's the implementation fix:

The other files remain unchanged as they were not part of the issue.

____
The above was an AI response about coding, does the end of the response say that there are other files remaining to be written e.g. "I'll continue with the remaining files in the next response" or "Do you want me to continue writing xyz file?". Alternatively, did the start of the response EXPLICITLY list a set of files that was supposed to be written in this response. If the response EXPLICITLY said it would create the file but the file was not created here (and it's not implied that the file was already created in an earlier message). Then it's also incomplete. Alternatively, if it did not write any files at all but rather it is explicitly asking something like "should I proceed with the implementation". Then it's also incomplete

If so, answer yes

Content: No - the response ends by saying "The other files remain unchanged as they were not part of the issue." This is a clear statement that no other files need to be written or modified, rather than implying there are remaining files to be written. The response also did not explicitly list files that were supposed to be written but weren't.

The valid variations are listed in assetManifest.js, and 'confused' is not among them. The solution involves replacing 'confused' with valid variations like 'thinking' and 'surprised' to maintain the intended emotional context.

Let me plan out the Home page implementation:

PLANNING:
The Home page should reflect the surreal, artistic nature of the game while maintaining elegance and minimalism. 

Z-layer structure:
1. z-0: Base gradient background
2. z-10: Animated gradient overlay for ethereal effect
3. z-20: Content container with title and button

Design elements:
- Soft, dreamy gradient background using rose and slate colors to match Loading page
- Elegant typography using Playfair Display for title
- Subtle floating animation for title
- Stylized button with hover effects
- Gentle pulsing animation for visual interest

Additional fonts needed:
- Adding "Cormorant Garavin" for an elegant serif font

Implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700', 
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400',
  'Cormorant Garavin:400,600'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Home.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Home({ onStartGame }) {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen w-screen overflow-hidden">
      {/* Base gradient */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-100 to-rose-100 opacity-90 pointer-events-none" />
      
      {/* Animated gradient overlay */}
      <div 
        className="absolute inset-0 animate-gradient-slow bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-200/50 via-rose-100/50 to-slate-100/50 pointer-events-none"
        style={{
          backgroundSize: '400% 400%',
          animation: 'gradient 15s ease infinite'
        }}
      />

      {/* Main content */}
      <div className="relative z-20 h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
        <h1 
          className="text-5xl md:text-6xl font-playfair font-bold mb-12 text-slate-800 text-center leading-tight animate-float"
          style={{
            textShadow: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'
          }}
        >
          eternity_1
        </h1>

        <button
          onClick={onStartGame}
          className="px-12 py-4 bg-slate-800 text-rose-50 rounded-lg font-cormorant text-xl tracking-wider
                     hover:bg-slate-700 hover:scale-105 transform transition-all duration-300
                     shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl active:scale-95"
        >
          Begin Journey
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
1. Maintains consistent styling with Loading page
2. Uses elegant typography and animations
3. Creates an ethereal, artistic atmosphere
4. Ensures proper z-indexing and pointer events
5. Provides clear visual feedback for interactions
6. Scales well on different screen sizes
7. Matches the surreal, artistic theme of the game

The animations and transitions are subtle and enhance rather than distract from the experience. The color scheme ties into the game's artistic themes while maintaining readability and visual appeal.

The above was an AI response about how to write or edit code, I explicitly want every line of code to be written in the files without any line left out. Inside the files that are intended to be written, are there any comment in any of the above that has code comments like "existing code here", "remaining code stays the same", "rest of xyz implementation here", "previous code remains the same", "implement the rest of xyz here"?

Carefully look through every comment in the code and determine if any comment indicates that there is unwritten code in the file.

The only exception is when the omission exists in the first section of the response (i.e. the analysis of the error). If there are omissions in the first section, this is only okay if the second section in the above response contains all the files I'm supposed to copy-paste into the file system and those files in the second section have no omissions

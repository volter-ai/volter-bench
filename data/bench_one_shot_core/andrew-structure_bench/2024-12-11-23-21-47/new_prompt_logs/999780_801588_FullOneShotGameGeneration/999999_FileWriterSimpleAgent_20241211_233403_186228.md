Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise yet engaging summary of the game. It should capture the essence of the game, its genre, and a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics and story progression. I will focus on the unique aspects of the game, such as its visual novel style, the role of player choices, and the central theme of time manipulation.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, character backgrounds, story branches, and gameplay mechanics. I will draw from the provided game overview, plot summary, setting, and character descriptions to create a comprehensive and engaging narrative that informs potential players about what to expect from the game.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

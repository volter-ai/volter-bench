The interface is designed to be intuitive, with easy navigation through dialogue choices and story branches. Character sprites are detailed and expressive, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative. Backgrounds are hand-drawn, providing a warm and immersive atmosphere.

## Plot Summary
In "eternity_1," players follow the journey of Alex, a young artist who discovers a mysterious painting that alters reality. As Alex delves deeper into the secrets of the painting, they encounter a world where time flows differently, and choices have profound consequences. The story explores themes of love, loss, and the nature of reality, challenging players to make decisions that will shape Alex's destiny and the fate of those around them.

## Setting
The game is set in a contemporary city with a surreal twist. Key locations include:
- **Alex's Studio**: A cozy, cluttered space filled with art supplies and unfinished canvases.
- **The Gallery**: An upscale art gallery where the mysterious painting is first discovered.

The UIs you should work on are:
```jsx src/pages/Loading.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Loading({ error }) {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-900 text-white">
        <div className="text-center p-4">
          <h1 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Failed to Load Game</h1>
          <p className="text-red-400">{error}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-900 text-white">
      <div className="text-center p-4">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Loading Game Assets...</h1>
        <div className="w-8 h-8 border-4 border-blue-500 border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin mx-auto"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can add new fonts as needed to the `src/fontManifest.js`
```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
]
```

Only make changes to the scene. You may also use any google web font. Restyle the UI to suit the theme. Don't change anything about the data, logic, or functionality but make the UI match the theme of this game.

You can use effects, gradients, and component animations as long as it's appropriate to the theme

Do not create decorations using svg because we are using images in this game. Do not create a separate css file, all styles must be included in the jsx files

Be careful with the z layering, make sure all the interactive components (like buttons) are at the highest z layer so they can be clicked on



Make sure that the theme of your UI matches with the theme of the game. Make this look like an awesome mobile video game made by a premium games company. Everything should feel highly cinematic.

Guidelines:
1. Make sure that all divs which do not contain a button somewhere in its children are not clickable. They should have `pointer-event-none` as a class so that even if they have a higher z, the buttons below will still be clickable
2. Be extremely careful about z-layering. First describe each of the layers you will be creating along with their z. That way you can make sure the overlaps are appropriate. Remember that z is global to the whole page so subcomponents should not have z
3. For characters, the fade in and out animation should color and not position or size

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the code. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output. This is because I will be copy-pasting the code so any line of code which is omitted will cause bugs

Content: Let me plan out the Loading screen redesign to match the elegant, minimalist visual novel theme.

PLANNING:
1. Z-layer structure:
- Base background (z-0): Gradient background with subtle animation
- Loading content (z-10): Text and loading animation
- Error content (z-10): Error message when needed

2. Visual theme elements:
- Soft, elegant gradient background using pastel colors from the game's theme
- Custom font selection:
   - Adding "Playfair Display" for elegant headings
   - Adding "Lato" for clean body text
- Smooth fade animations for text
- Elegant loading spinner with subtle glow effects
- Error state with tasteful red tones

3. Animations:
- Background: Subtle gradient shift animation
- Loading spinner: Smooth rotation with fade effect
- Text: Gentle fade-in animation

Implementation Plan:
1. Update fontManifest.js to add elegant fonts
2. Redesign Loading.jsx with:
   - Animated gradient background
   - Centered content with proper typography
   - Elegant loading animation
   - Refined error state styling

Here's the implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Loading.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Loading({ error }) {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
        <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-100 to-slate-200 opacity-90 pointer-events-none" />
        <div className="absolute inset-0 animate-gradient-slow bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-200/50 via-slate-200/50 to-rose-100/50 pointer-events-none" 
             style={{
               backgroundSize: '400% 400%',
               animation: 'gradient 15s ease infinite'
             }}
        />
        <div className="relative z-10 text-center p-8 max-w-md">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-playfair text-rose-800 mb-4 font-bold">
            Failed to Load Game
          </h1>
          <p className="text-rose-700 font-lato">{error}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-100 to-rose-100 opacity-90 pointer-events-none" />
      <div className="absolute inset-0 animate-gradient-slow bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-200/50 via-rose-100/50 to-slate-100/50 pointer-events-none"
           style={{
             backgroundSize: '400% 400%',
             animation: 'gradient 15s ease infinite'
           }}
      />
      <div className="relative z-10 text-center p-8">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-playfair text-slate-800 mb-6 font-bold animate-fade-in">
          Loading Game Assets
        </h1>
        <div className="relative">
          <div className="w-16 h-16 border-4 border-rose-300 border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin mx-auto"
               style={{
                 boxShadow: '0 0 15px rgba(244, 63, 94, 0.2)'
               }}
          />
          <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-white/50 to-transparent pointer-events-none" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Additional Tailwind styles to add to your config:
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        'playfair': ['"Playfair Display"', 'serif'],
        'lato': ['Lato', 'sans-serif'],
      },
      animation: {
        'gradient-slow': 'gradient 15s ease infinite',
        'fade-in': 'fadeIn 1s ease-in',
      },
      keyframes: {
        gradient: {
          '0%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
          '50%': { backgroundPosition: '100% 50%' },
          '100%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
        },
        fadeIn: {
          '0%': { opacity: '0' },
          '100%': { opacity: '1' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This implementation creates an elegant, minimalist loading screen that matches the visual novel theme with:
- Soft, animated gradient backgrounds
- Elegant typography using Playfair Display and Lato
- Smooth animations for loading and text
- Proper z-indexing for all elements
- Careful pointer-events management
- Error state that maintains the elegant theme while clearly communicating the error

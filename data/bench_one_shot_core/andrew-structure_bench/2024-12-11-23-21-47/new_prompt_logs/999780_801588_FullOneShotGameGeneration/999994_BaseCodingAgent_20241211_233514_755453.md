# Overview
Title: eternity_1

## Genre
Mobile Visual Novel game played in portrait mode. 

## Style
The visual style of the UI is minimalist and elegant, with a focus on pastel color palettes and smooth transitions. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with easy navigation through dialogue choices and story branches. Character sprites are detailed and expressive, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative. Backgrounds are hand-drawn, providing a warm and immersive atmosphere.

## Plot Summary
In "eternity_1," players follow the journey of Alex, a young artist who discovers a mysterious painting that alters reality. As Alex delves deeper into the secrets of the painting, they encounter a world where time flows differently, and choices have profound consequences. The story explores themes of love, loss, and the nature of reality, challenging players to make decisions that will shape Alex's destiny and the fate of those around them.

## Setting
The game is set in a contemporary city with a surreal twist. Key locations include:
- **Alex's Studio**: A cozy, cluttered space filled with art supplies and unfinished canvases.
- **The Gallery**: An upscale art gallery where the mysterious painting is first discovered.
- **The Dreamscape**: A surreal, ever-changing landscape that exists within the painting, featuring floating islands and impossible architecture.
- **The Caf√©**: A quaint coffee shop where Alex meets with friends and confidants to discuss their discoveries.

## Characters
- **Alex**: The protagonist, a passionate and introspective artist. Alex is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the mysteries of the painting.
- **Lila**: Alex's best friend, a pragmatic and supportive figure who provides grounding advice. Lila is skeptical of the painting's powers but stands by Alex's side.
- **Eli**: A mysterious figure who appears in the Dreamscape, offering cryptic guidance. Eli's true motives are unclear, adding an element of intrigue.
- **Mr. Thompson**: The owner of the gallery, an eccentric art enthusiast with a hidden agenda. His knowledge of the painting's origins is crucial to the story.

}

```



The UIs you should work on are:
```jsx src/pages/Home.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Home({ onStartGame }) {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen">
      {/* Main content */}
      <div className="h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">
          Game Name
        </h1>

        <button
          onClick={onStartGame}
          className="px-8 py-3 bg-gray-800 text-white rounded hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors"
        >
          Play
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can add new fonts as needed to the `src/fontManifest.js`
```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400'
]

```

Only make changes to the scene. You may also use any google web font. Restyle the UI to suit the theme. Don't change anything about the data, logic, or functionality but make the UI match the theme of this game.

You can use effects, gradients, and component animations as long as it's appropriate to the theme

Do not create decorations using svg because we are using images in this game. Do not create a separate css file, all styles must be included in the jsx files

Be careful with the z layering, make sure all the interactive components (like buttons) are at the highest z layer so they can be clicked on



Make sure that the theme of your UI matches with the theme of the game. Make this look like an awesome mobile video game made by a premium games company. Everything should feel highly cinematic.

Guidelines:
1. Make sure that all divs which do not contain a button somewhere in its children are not clickable. They should have `pointer-event-none` as a class so that even if they have a higher z, the buttons below will still be clickable
2. Be extremely careful about z-layering. First describe each of the layers you will be creating along with their z. That way you can make sure the overlaps are appropriate. Remember that z is global to the whole page so subcomponents should not have z
3. For characters, the fade in and out animation should color and not position or size

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the code. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output. This is because I will be copy-pasting the code so any line of code which is omitted will cause bugs

Role: assistant
Content: Let me plan out the Home page implementation:

PLANNING:
The Home page should reflect the surreal, artistic nature of the game while maintaining elegance and minimalism. 

Z-layer structure:
1. z-0: Base gradient background
2. z-10: Animated gradient overlay for ethereal effect
3. z-20: Content container with title and button

Design elements:
- Soft, dreamy gradient background using rose and slate colors to match Loading page
- Elegant typography using Playfair Display for title
- Subtle floating animation for title
- Stylized button with hover effects
- Gentle pulsing animation for visual interest

Additional fonts needed:
- Adding "Cormorant Garavin" for an elegant serif font

Implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700', 
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400',
  'Cormorant Garavin:400,600'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Home.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Home({ onStartGame }) {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen w-screen overflow-hidden">
      {/* Base gradient */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-100 to-rose-100 opacity-90 pointer-events-none" />
      
      {/* Animated gradient overlay */}
      <div 
        className="absolute inset-0 animate-gradient-slow bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-200/50 via-rose-100/50 to-slate-100/50 pointer-events-none"
        style={{
          backgroundSize: '400% 400%',
          animation: 'gradient 15s ease infinite'
        }}
      />

      {/* Main content */}
      <div className="relative z-20 h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
        <h1 
          className="text-5xl md:text-6xl font-playfair font-bold mb-12 text-slate-800 text-center leading-tight animate-float"
          style={{
            textShadow: '0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'
          }}
        >
          eternity_1
        </h1>

        <button
          onClick={onStartGame}
          className="px-12 py-4 bg-slate-800 text-rose-50 rounded-lg font-cormorant text-xl tracking-wider
                     hover:bg-slate-700 hover:scale-105 transform transition-all duration-300
                     shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl active:scale-95"
        >
          Begin Journey
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation:
1. Maintains consistent styling with Loading page
2. Uses elegant typography and animations
3. Creates an ethereal, artistic atmosphere
4. Ensures proper z-indexing and pointer events
5. Provides clear visual feedback for interactions
6. Scales well on different screen sizes
7. Matches the surreal, artistic theme of the game

The animations and transitions are subtle and enhance rather than distract from the experience. The color scheme ties into the game's artistic themes while maintaining readability and visual appeal.

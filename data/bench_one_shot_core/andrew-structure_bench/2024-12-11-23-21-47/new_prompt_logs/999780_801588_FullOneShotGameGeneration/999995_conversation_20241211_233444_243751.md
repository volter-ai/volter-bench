Let me plan out the Loading screen redesign to match the elegant, minimalist visual novel theme.

PLANNING:
1. Z-layer structure:
- Base background (z-0): Gradient background with subtle animation
- Loading content (z-10): Text and loading animation
- Error content (z-10): Error message when needed

2. Visual theme elements:
- Soft, elegant gradient background using pastel colors from the game's theme
- Custom font selection:
   - Adding "Playfair Display" for elegant headings
   - Adding "Lato" for clean body text
- Smooth fade animations for text
- Elegant loading spinner with subtle glow effects
- Error state with tasteful red tones

3. Animations:
- Background: Subtle gradient shift animation
- Loading spinner: Smooth rotation with fade effect
- Text: Gentle fade-in animation

Implementation Plan:
1. Update fontManifest.js to add elegant fonts
2. Redesign Loading.jsx with:
   - Animated gradient background
   - Centered content with proper typography
   - Elegant loading animation
   - Refined error state styling

Here's the implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Loading.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Loading({ error }) {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
        <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-100 to-slate-200 opacity-90 pointer-events-none" />
        <div className="absolute inset-0 animate-gradient-slow bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-200/50 via-slate-200/50 to-rose-100/50 pointer-events-none" 
             style={{
               backgroundSize: '400% 400%',
               animation: 'gradient 15s ease infinite'
             }}
        />
        <div className="relative z-10 text-center p-8 max-w-md">
          <h1 className="text-2xl font-playfair text-rose-800 mb-4 font-bold">
            Failed to Load Game
          </h1>
          <p className="text-rose-700 font-lato">{error}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-100 to-rose-100 opacity-90 pointer-events-none" />
      <div className="absolute inset-0 animate-gradient-slow bg-gradient-to-br from-slate-200/50 via-rose-100/50 to-slate-100/50 pointer-events-none"
           style={{
             backgroundSize: '400% 400%',
             animation: 'gradient 15s ease infinite'
           }}
      />
      <div className="relative z-10 text-center p-8">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-playfair text-slate-800 mb-6 font-bold animate-fade-in">
          Loading Game Assets
        </h1>
        <div className="relative">
          <div className="w-16 h-16 border-4 border-rose-300 border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin mx-auto"
               style={{
                 boxShadow: '0 0 15px rgba(244, 63, 94, 0.2)'
               }}
          />
          <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-white/50 to-transparent pointer-events-none" />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Additional Tailwind styles to add to your config:
```js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        'playfair': ['"Playfair Display"', 'serif'],
        'lato': ['Lato', 'sans-serif'],
      },
      animation: {
        'gradient-slow': 'gradient 15s ease infinite',
        'fade-in': 'fadeIn 1s ease-in',
      },
      keyframes: {
        gradient: {
          '0%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
          '50%': { backgroundPosition: '100% 50%' },
          '100%': { backgroundPosition: '0% 50%' },
        },
        fadeIn: {
          '0%': { opacity: '0' },
          '100%': { opacity: '1' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

This implementation creates an elegant, minimalist loading screen that matches the visual novel theme with:
- Soft, animated gradient backgrounds
- Elegant typography using Playfair Display and Lato
- Smooth animations for loading and text
- Proper z-indexing for all elements
- Careful pointer-events management
- Error state that maintains the elegant theme while clearly communicating the error

The above was an AI response about how to write or edit code, I explicitly want every line of code to be written in the files without any line left out. Inside the files that are intended to be written, are there any comment in any of the above that has code comments like "existing code here", "remaining code stays the same", "rest of xyz implementation here", "previous code remains the same", "implement the rest of xyz here"?

Carefully look through every comment in the code and determine if any comment indicates that there is unwritten code in the file.

The only exception is when the omission exists in the first section of the response (i.e. the analysis of the error). If there are omissions in the first section, this is only okay if the second section in the above response contains all the files I'm supposed to copy-paste into the file system and those files in the second section have no omissions

Content: No, there are no comments indicating unwritten or omitted code in any of the files shown. The code blocks show complete implementations for:

1. fontManifest.js - Complete file with FONTS array
2. Loading.jsx - Complete component with both error and loading states
3. Tailwind config additions - Complete set of style extensions

There are no placeholders, "existing code here" comments, or any other indicators of omitted code within these file implementations. Each file appears to be shown in its entirety.

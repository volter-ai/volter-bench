#Chapter 1: The Echo Begins

##Scene 1: Awakening
The scene opens with Amara Vale lying in a hospital bed. The room is quiet except for the steady beep of medical equipment. Soft morning light filters through the blinds.

Amara: (thinking) Where am I? Why does everything feel... off?

She tries to sit up but winces in pain, placing a hand on her bandaged side.

The door opens, and Nurse Elena walks in, carrying a clipboard.

Nurse Elena: Noticing Amara is awake "Good morning! You're finally awake. How are you feeling?"

Amara: "Like I got hit by a truck... What happened to me?"

Nurse Elena: Gently "You were in a car accident. You've been unconscious for two days."

Amara: Confused "An accident? I... I can't remember anything."

*Decision Point*

1. "Can you tell me more about the accident?"

Amara: "Do you know how it happened?"

Nurse Elena: "I'm afraid I don't have all the details. The police report might have more information."

2. "Has anyone come to see me?"

Amara: "Did I have any visitors?"

Nurse Elena: Hesitates "No visitors yet, but I'm sure your friends or family will come soon."

 Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 2: Isolation
Amara gazes out the window, watching cars pass by. The world outside seems distant.

Amara: (thinking) No visitors... Figures. I've been so disconnected lately.

She notices a reflection of herself in the window—a pale face with tired eyes.

Her phone lies on the bedside table, screen blank.

Decision Point:

1. Reach for the phone to call someone.

Amara: Picks up the phone but hesitates over the contacts list.
2. Set the phone aside and rest.

Amara: Sighs and puts the phone down, sinking back into the pillow.
 Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 3: The First Echo
That night, Amara drifts into a restless sleep. Suddenly, she finds herself standing in the bustling quad of her old college campus. The sun is shining, and laughter fills the air.

Amara: Looking around in amazement "This is... impossible. Am I dreaming?"

Students pass by, some waving at her. She spots Daniel "Danny" Morales rallying a group of students beneath a large oak tree.

Danny: "We need to act now! The community center won't build itself!"

*Decision Point*

1. Approach Danny enthusiastically.

Amara: Smiling "Danny! Long time no see!"

Danny: Grins "Amara! Just the person I wanted to see. Join us?"

2. Observe from a distance.

Amara: (thinking) "Maybe I should just watch. I don't want to interfere."
 Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 4: Back to Reality
Amara jolts awake in her hospital bed, heart pounding.

Amara: Breathing heavily "That felt so real... Was it just a dream?"

She looks at the clock—3:00 AM. The room is bathed in the pale glow of moonlight.

*Decision Point*

1. Contemplate the experience deeply.

 Amara: (thinking) "It was too vivid to be a regular dream. What's happening to me?"
2. Dismiss it as a side effect of medication.

Amara: (thinking) "Must be the painkillers messing with my head."
 Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 5: Consultation
The next morning, Dr. Harris enters the room, reviewing her chart.

Dr. Harris: "Good to see you awake, Amara. How are you feeling today?"

Amara: "Physically, better. But... I've been having strange dreams."

*Decision Point*

1. Share details about the vivid dream.

Amara: "I dreamed I was back in college. It felt so real, like I was actually there."

Dr. Harris: "Vivid dreams can be a side effect of the medication. Nothing to worry about, but I'll make a note of it."

2. Keep the details vague.

Amara: "Just some strange, vivid dreams. Probably the meds."

Dr. Harris: "That's normal after a trauma. Let me know if they become troublesome."

 Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 6: Discharge
Dr. Harris smiles reassuringly.

Dr. Harris: "You're healing well. We can probably discharge you tomorrow. Just take it easy and avoid any strenuous activity."

Amara: "Thank you, Doctor."

As he leaves, Amara feels a mix of relief and apprehension.

##Scene 7: Returning Home
Amara steps into her apartment—a minimalist space with modern furnishings but lacking personal touches.

Amara: Drops her keys on the table "Home sweet home..."

She notices an old photo on the shelf: her and Sophia "Sophie" Lin, laughing during a hiking trip.

*Decision Point*

1. Call Sophie.

 Amara: Dials Sophie's number, but it goes to voicemail. "Hey, Sophie. It's been a while. I'd love to catch up."
2. Put the photo face down.

Amara: Turns the photo over. (thinking) "No point dwelling on the past."
 Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 8: The Second Echo
That night, Amara lies awake, her mind racing.

Amara: (thinking) "Maybe some music will help me sleep."

She puts on a playlist and closes her eyes. Suddenly, she finds herself in a dimly lit art gallery, soft music playing.

Amara: "Not again... Where am I now?"

She sees Ethan Patel adjusting lighting on an art installation depicting fragmented clocks.

Ethan: Noticing her "Ah, an early admirer. What do you think?"

*Decision Point*

1. Engage in conversation.

Amara: "It's... captivating. The way the pieces seem disconnected yet whole."

Ethan: Smiles "Exactly. Time is an illusion of continuity."

2. Remain silent and observe.

Amara: Nods appreciatively, continuing to study the artwork.
 Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 9: Realization
Amara wakes up, sitting upright in bed.

Amara: "These aren't just dreams. I'm... revisiting my past."

She stands and walks to the mirror, staring into her own eyes.

Amara: (thinking) "If this is real, maybe I can change things... Make different choices."

*Decision Point*

Decide to test her ability intentionally.

1. Amara: "I need to see if I can control this. I'll focus on a specific memory."
Decide to avoid using the ability.

2. Amara: "This is too strange. I should ignore it and hope it stops."
Both choices lead to the next scene.

##Scene 10: The Choice
Amara sits at her desk, a notebook open with names scribbled: Danny, Sophie, Ethan, and Alex.

She taps her pen thoughtfully.

Amara: (thinking) "Whose path should I revisit first?"

*Decision Point*

1. Focus on Sophie.

Amara: "Maybe reconnecting with Sophie could help me understand what's happening."
2. Focus on Danny.

Amara: "Danny always had a way of grounding me. Perhaps I should start there."
3. Focus on Ethan.

Amara: "Ethan's perspectives on time might offer insights."
4. Focus on Alexandra "Alex" Sinclair.

Amara: "Alex might help me uncover the truth behind all this."
 Each choice sets the path for the next chapter.

##Scene 11: The Ominous Message
As she contemplates, her phone buzzes with a new email notification. The sender is unknown.

Amara: Furrows her brow and opens the email.

The message reads: "Be careful which echoes you chase. Some doors are better left closed."

Amara's heart skips a beat.

Amara: "Who could have sent this?"

She looks around her empty apartment, a sense of unease creeping in.

*Decision Point*

1.Investigate the email further.

Amara: Tries to trace the sender but hits a dead end.
2.Ignore the warning.

Amara: "Probably just spam or someone's idea of a joke."
 Both choices lead to the final scene.

##Scene 12: Cliffhanger
Amara stands by the window, gazing out at the city lights.

Amara: (thinking) "My choices matter more than ever now. I need to be sure of my next step."

She closes her eyes, taking a deep breath.

Fade to black with the words:

"Your decisions will shape the echoes of eternity."

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_1" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics of the game, including how to play, earn currency, and increase currency rates.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. This section will provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game mechanics and objectives.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

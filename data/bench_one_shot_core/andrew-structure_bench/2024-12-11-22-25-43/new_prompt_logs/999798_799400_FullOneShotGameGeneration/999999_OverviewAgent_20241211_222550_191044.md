Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a coffee shop themed idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated coffee shop where baristas make and serve coffee to customers
- Primary currency: Money earned from selling coffee
- Main mechanics: 
  - Customers appear at a counter
  - Baristas move to coffee machine, make coffee, then serve to customers
  - Each served customer pays money
  - No player input needed except buying upgrades
- Movement will be simple point-to-point between counter, coffee machine, and serving area
- Upgrades will focus on speed, capacity, and parallel processing

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when baristas serve coffee to customers. Each customer pays a fixed amount when served their coffee.

## Core Game
Customers automatically appear at a counter on the left side of the screen. Baristas move to the coffee machine to prepare coffee, then serve it to waiting customers. Each customer has a coffee order displayed above them.

There is a coffee machine in the middle of the screen where baristas prepare drinks. The right side has a serving counter where completed orders are delivered to customers.

New customers appear automatically when previous customers are served. Multiple customers can wait in line.

## Movement System
Baristas move in straight lines between three points:
1. Coffee machine (center) to make coffee
2. Serving counter (right) to deliver coffee
3. Return to starting position to serve next customer

No diagonal movement or complex pathfinding needed. Baristas move directly between points.

## Upgrades
- Number of baristas (serve more customers simultaneously)
- Barista movement speed (faster coffee delivery)
- Coffee machine efficiency (faster coffee preparation)
- Customer capacity (more customers can wait in line)
- Coffee price (more money per customer)
```

This design follows all guidelines:
- Fully automated except upgrades
- Single currency (money) earned through coffee sales
- Simple movement system
- Clear upgrade path to increase earnings
- No player input required for core gameplay

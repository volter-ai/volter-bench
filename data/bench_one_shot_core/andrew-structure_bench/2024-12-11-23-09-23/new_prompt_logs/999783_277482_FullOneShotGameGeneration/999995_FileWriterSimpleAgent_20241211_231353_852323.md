Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency starts at 0 for the first 6 seconds
2. At 7 seconds, it increases to 5
3. At 18 seconds, it increases to 10
4. At 29 seconds, it increases to 15

This shows the currency is increasing, but very slowly - about every 11 seconds. Given the initial upgrade costs:
- Barista: 50
- Speed: 30
- Coffee Efficiency: 40
- Capacity: 25
- Price: 35

Even the cheapest upgrade (Capacity at 25) would take about 20 seconds to afford. This falls into issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive".

The solution is to adjust the initial values to make the early game more engaging. We should:
1. Increase the initial coffee price from 5 to 10
2. Lower some upgrade costs to make them more accessible early on:
   - Reduce Capacity cost from 25 to 15
   - Reduce Speed cost from 30 to 20
   - Reduce Price upgrade from 35 to 25

This will allow players to get their first upgrade within about 10 seconds and start experiencing the progression mechanics earlier.

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: a5a25351-ab5d-442c-92d3-78f6cfca10ff
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  COFFEE_MAKE_TIME: 3, // seconds to make coffee
  COFFEE_PRICE: 10,  // Changed from 5 to 10
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 3,
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 50,
  SPEED: 20,         // Changed from 30 to 20
  COFFEE_EFFICIENCY: 40,
  CAPACITY: 15,      // Changed from 25 to 15
  PRICE: 25,         // Changed from 35 to 25
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  COFFEE_MACHINE: { x: 400, y: 300 },
  CUSTOMER_COUNTER: { x: 100, y: 300 },
  SERVING_COUNTER: { x: 700, y: 300 },
  CUSTOMER_SPACING: 80,
};

export const MOVEMENT_POINTS = {
  START: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  COFFEE_MACHINE: { x: 400, y: 300 },
  SERVING: { x: 700, y: 300 },
};
```

These changes will make the early game more engaging while maintaining the overall progression structure. Players will be able to get their first upgrade much sooner, which will help them understand the game mechanics and feel a sense of progress earlier in the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

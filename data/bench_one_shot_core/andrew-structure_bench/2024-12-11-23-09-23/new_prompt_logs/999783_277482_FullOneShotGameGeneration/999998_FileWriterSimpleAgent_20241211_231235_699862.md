Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation first:

1. Implementation Plan:
- The game is a coffee shop management game where we need to manage baristas, coffee prices, and customer capacity
- From gameData.js, we can see there are 5 types of upgrades:
  * Hire Barista (increases staff)
  * Upgrade Speed (makes baristas move faster)
  * Upgrade Coffee Machine (reduces coffee making time)
  * Increase Capacity (allows more customers in queue)
  * Increase Coffee Price (increases revenue per coffee)

- For the GameAI implementation:
  1. Define UPGRADES array with all upgrade types
  2. Implement getMainCurrency() to return game.money
  3. For experimental mode:
     - Set infinite money
     - Randomly apply 0-10 upgrades of each type
  4. For updateGameStats():
     - Show money, barista count, coffee price, customer capacity
     - Show upgrade levels for each type
  5. For checkCheapestUpgrade():
     - Check all upgrade costs
     - Buy the cheapest one if we have enough money
  6. For performUpgrade():
     - Handle each upgrade type by calling corresponding game method
     - Track upgrade levels
     - Log the upgrade if not in experimental mode

2. Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 15fe36d2-7a11-46d3-a857-3b7463322e4d
```javascript src/GameAI.js
import { AIUtils } from './AIUtils';
import { INITIAL_VALUES, UPGRADE_COSTS } from './game/gameData';

const UPGRADES = [
  'barista',
  'speed', 
  'efficiency',
  'capacity',
  'price'
];

export class GameAI {
  constructor() {
    this.ai = new AIUtils();
    this.game = null;
    this.initialized = false;
    // Initialize upgrade levels for all upgrade types
    this.upgradeLevels = UPGRADES.reduce((acc, upgrade) => {
      acc[upgrade] = 0;
      return acc;
    }, {});
  }

  init() {
    if (!window.game || !window.game.ready) {
      setTimeout(() => this.init(), 100);
      return;
    }
    this.game = window.game;

    if (this.initialized) return;
    this.initialized = true;

    window.game.app.ticker.speed = this.ai.defaultGameSpeed;
    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game speed set to ' + this.ai.defaultGameSpeed + 'x');

    if (this.ai.enabled) {
      this.ai.gameStartTime = Date.now();

      if (this.ai.mode === 'experimental') {
        this.setupExperimentalMode();
      }

      this.ai.startLoggingLoop(this.getMainCurrency.bind(this));
      this.startUpgradeLoop();
      this.updateGameStats();

      setTimeout(() => {
        this.ai.stopAI();
        this.ai.exportLogs();
        this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Session ended - logs exported');
      }, this.ai.duration);
    }
  }

  getMainCurrency() {
    return this.game.money;
  }

  setupExperimentalMode() {
    // Give infinite money for experimental mode
    this.game.money = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // Randomly upgrade each stat between 0-10 times
    UPGRADES.forEach(upgrade => {
      const times = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11); // 0 to 10
      for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
        this.performUpgrade(upgrade, 0, true);
      }
    });

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Experimental mode initialized with random upgrades');
  }

  updateGameStats() {
    const stats = {
      Money: this.game.money,
      'Barista Count': this.game.baristaCount,
      'Coffee Price': this.game.coffeePrice,
      'Customer Capacity': this.game.customerCapacity,
      'Barista Speed': Math.round(this.game.baristaSpeed),
      'Coffee Make Time': this.game.coffeeMakeTime.toFixed(1) + 's',
      'Barista Level': this.upgradeLevels.barista,
      'Speed Level': this.upgradeLevels.speed,
      'Efficiency Level': this.upgradeLevels.efficiency,
      'Capacity Level': this.upgradeLevels.capacity,
      'Price Level': this.upgradeLevels.price
    };

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game stats updated', stats);
  }

  startUpgradeLoop() {
    if (!this.ai.enabled || this.ai.mode === 'experimental') return;

    this.upgradeInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.checkCheapestUpgrade();
      this.updateGameStats();
    }, 100);
  }

  checkCheapestUpgrade() {
    let cheapestUpgrade = null;
    let lowestCost = Infinity;

    for (const upgrade of UPGRADES) {
      const cost = this.game.upgradeCosts[upgrade];
      if (cost <= this.game.money && cost < lowestCost) {
        cheapestUpgrade = upgrade;
        lowestCost = cost;
      }
    }

    if (cheapestUpgrade) {
      this.performUpgrade(cheapestUpgrade, lowestCost);
    }
  }

  performUpgrade(upgradeName, cost, skipLogging = false) {
    // Increment the upgrade level before performing the upgrade
    this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName]++;
    const currentLevel = this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName];

    switch (upgradeName) {
      case 'barista':
        this.game.upgradeBarista();
        break;
      case 'speed':
        this.game.upgradeSpeed();
        break;
      case 'efficiency':
        this.game.upgradeEfficiency();
        break;
      case 'capacity':
        this.game.upgradeCapacity();
        break;
      case 'price':
        this.game.upgradePrice();
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`${upgradeName} is not a valid upgrade`);
    }

    if (!skipLogging) {
      const upgradeInfo = {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        upgrade: upgradeName,
        cost: cost,
        level: currentLevel
      };

      this.ai.logUpgrade(upgradeInfo);
      this.ai.updateDebugOverlay(`Purchased ${upgradeName} upgrade for ${cost} (Level ${currentLevel})`);
    }
  }
}

const gameAI = new GameAI();
gameAI.init();

if (window.game) {
  window.game.exportAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.exportLogs();
  window.game.clearAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.clearLogs();
}

export default gameAI;
```

This implementation:
1. Defines all 5 upgrade types from the game
2. Tracks upgrade levels separately from the game state
3. In experimental mode, gives infinite money and randomly applies upgrades
4. In normal mode, continuously buys the cheapest available upgrade
5. Logs detailed stats including all upgrade levels and game metrics
6. Properly integrates with the AIUtils for logging and UI updates

The AI will automatically purchase upgrades to optimize the coffee shop's efficiency and profit generation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"

- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"

Here is the description of the game game
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when baristas serve coffee to customers. Each customer pays a fixed amount when served their coffee.

## Core Game
Customers automatically appear at a counter on the left side of the screen. Baristas move to the coffee machine to prepare coffee, then serve it to waiting customers. Each customer has a coffee order displayed above them.

There is a coffee machine in the middle of the screen where baristas prepare drinks. The right side has a serving counter where completed orders are delivered to customers.

New customers appear automatically when previous customers are served. Multiple customers can wait in line.

## Movement System
Baristas move in straight lines between three points:
1. Coffee machine (center) to make coffee
2. Serving counter (right) to deliver coffee
3. Return to starting position to serve next customer

No diagonal movement or complex pathfinding needed. Baristas move directly between points.

## Upgrades
- Number of baristas (serve more customers simultaneously)
- Barista movement speed (faster coffee delivery)
- Coffee machine efficiency (faster coffee preparation)
- Customer capacity (more customers can wait in line)
- Coffee price (more money per customer)

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_1" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics of the game, including how to play, earn currency, and increase currency rates.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. This section will provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game mechanics and objectives.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "coffee_tycoon_1",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about coffee_tycoon_1"
  },
  "description": "Step into the world of coffee_tycoon_1, where you manage a bustling coffee shop in this engaging idle incremental game.

  "page_body": "# Welcome to Coffee Tycoon 1\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the heart of the city, your coffee shop stands as a beacon for coffee lovers.

### Coffee Tycoon

#### **Core Game:**
- Customers spawn randomly and enter the coffee shop.
- Inside the shop, there is a coffee counter where baristas prepare and serve coffee. The number of customers waiting in line is displayed above the counter.
- There is one basic barista who takes orders, prepares coffee, and serves customers.
- A new customer spawns each time a customer leaves the shop after being served.

#### **Movement System:**
- **Customer Movement:**
  - Customers spawn at the shop entrance and proceed directly to the end of a single line in front of the counter.
  - As customers are served, those remaining in the line move forward one position to fill the gap.
  - After a customer completes a purchase, they move in a straight line toward the exit and disappear upon reaching it.

- **Barista Movement:**
  - Baristas remain positioned behind the counter at all times, facing the customer line. There is no need for baristas to move around, as they are always within reach of serving customers in the line.

- **Automated Systems:**
  - Any automatic coffee machines are fixed in position on the counter. They operate from a set location, handling coffee preparation tasks without any movement requirements.

#### **Upgrades:**
- **Number of Baristas:** Hire additional baristas to serve more customers simultaneously. Cost around 10.
- **Speed of Baristas:** Train baristas to prepare and serve coffee faster.
- **Coffee Variety:** Introduce new coffee types that can be sold at higher prices.
- **Shop Capacity:** Expand the shop to accommodate more customers at once.
- **Marketing Campaigns:** Invest in advertising to attract more customers.
- **Quality of Coffee Beans:** Upgrade to premium beans to increase the profit per coffee sold.
- **Automatic Coffee Machines:** Install machines to automate coffee preparation, increasing speed and efficiency.

Now, only the impatience mechanic has been removed, leaving everything else untouched. Let me know if this works better!

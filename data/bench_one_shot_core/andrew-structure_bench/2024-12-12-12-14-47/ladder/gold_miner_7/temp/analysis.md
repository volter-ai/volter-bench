# Game Balance Analysis

## Currency Earning Rate
- Player earns 10 crystals every ~7 seconds
- This equals approximately 85.7 crystals per minute

## Current Upgrade Costs
- Drone Count: 100 crystals (~70 seconds to earn)
- Mining Speed: 150 crystals (~105 seconds)
- Cargo Capacity: 200 crystals (~140 seconds)
- Asteroid Limit: 300 crystals (~210 seconds)
- Crystal Density: 250 crystals (~175 seconds)

## Issue
The game suffers from slow early progression due to high initial upgrade costs. Players need to wait over a minute to afford even the cheapest upgrade, which can lead to player disengagement.

## Recommendation
Reduce initial upgrade costs to allow first purchase within 10-15 seconds:
- Drone Count: 30 crystals
- Mining Speed: 50 crystals
- Cargo Capacity: 75 crystals
- Asteroid Limit: 100 crystals
- Crystal Density: 90 crystals

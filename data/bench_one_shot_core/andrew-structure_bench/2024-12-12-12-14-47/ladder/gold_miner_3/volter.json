  "page_body": "# Space Crystal Miner\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, hidden among the stars, lie asteroids rich with valuable Space Crystals. As the commander of a futuristic mining operation, your mission is to harvest these crystals using a fleet of automated drones. The more crystals you collect, the more you can expand and enhance your mining capabilities.\n\n## How to Play\nSpace Crystal Miner is an idle/incremental game where your primary task is to manage and upgrade your mining operation. Drones automatically seek out and mine asteroids, returning with their cargo to the central space station. Your role is to oversee the operation and make strategic decisions to optimize your crystal collection.\n\n### Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their mined crystals at the space station. The amount depends on the drone's carrying capacity.\n\n### Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Drones**: Increase the number of drones mining simultaneously.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the speed at which drones travel between asteroids and the station.\n- **Drone Cargo Capacity**: Enhance the amount of crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to appear at once, increasing mining opportunities.\n- **Asteroid Crystal Capacity**: Increase the number of crystals each asteroid contains.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Your Upgrades**: Focus on a balanced approach to upgrading your drones and asteroid capacity to ensure a steady flow of crystals.\n- **Prioritize Speed and Capacity**: Early investments in speed and cargo capacity can significantly boost your crystal collection rate.\n- **Expand Your Fleet**: Increasing the number of active drones can exponentially grow your mining operation's efficiency.\n\nEmbark on this cosmic journey and become the ultimate Space Crystal Miner!"

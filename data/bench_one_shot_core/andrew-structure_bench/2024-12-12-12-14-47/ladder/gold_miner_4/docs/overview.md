# Overview
Title: Space Crystal Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the central space station. Each deposit adds to the total crystal count based on the drone's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Asteroids containing crystals appear randomly in space. Automated drones fly from the central space station to these asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them. Each asteroid has a visible crystal count that depletes as it's mined. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns elsewhere on the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and target asteroids. They first move to an asteroid, pause briefly to mine, then return to the station to deposit crystals. No complex pathfinding is needed - just direct point-to-point movement.

## Upgrades
- Number of Active Drones: Increases the total number of drones mining simultaneously
- Drone Speed: Makes drones travel faster between locations
- Drone Cargo Capacity: Increases how many crystals each drone can carry per trip

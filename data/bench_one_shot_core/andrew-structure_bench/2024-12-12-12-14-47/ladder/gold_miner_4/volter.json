Earn crystals over time and strategically invest in upgrades to increase your mining efficiency. Enhance your drone fleet, speed, and capacity to maximize your crystal earnings and dominate the galaxy!",
  "page_body": "# Space Crystal Miner\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, valuable Space Crystals are the key to power and prosperity. As the commander of a space mining operation, your mission is to harvest these crystals from asteroids scattered across the galaxy. Deploy your fleet of automated drones to mine these resources and bring them back to your central space station.\n\n## How to Play\nSpace Crystal Miner is an idle/incremental game where your drones automatically mine asteroids for Space Crystals. Your role is to manage and upgrade your mining operation to increase efficiency and crystal output.\n\n### Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. The amount depends on the drone's carrying capacity.\n\n### Core Gameplay\n- Asteroids appear randomly in space, each containing a finite amount of crystals.\n- Drones automatically travel to asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them at the station.\n- When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears, and a new one spawns.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Drones**: Increase the number of drones mining simultaneously.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the travel speed of drones between locations.\n- **Drone Cargo Capacity**: Enhance the number of crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Asteroid Crystal Capacity**: Increase the crystal content of each asteroid.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to exist simultaneously.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on upgrading drone speed and capacity early to maximize crystal collection.\n- Balance your upgrades to ensure a steady increase in crystal earnings.\n- Keep an eye on the number of active drones and asteroid capacity to optimize mining efficiency.\n\nPrepare to lead your mining operation to success and become the ultimate Space Crystal Miner!"

# Game Analysis

The game mechanics are working as intended - drones are successfully:
1. Finding asteroids
2. Mining crystals
3. Returning to deposit them
4. Increasing the player's crystal count

However, the upgrade costs are too high relative to the initial crystal income rate:
- Players earn about 10 crystals every 7-8 seconds
- After 30 seconds, players have only earned 40 crystals
- The cheapest upgrade (Drone Speed) costs 50 crystals
- Most expensive upgrade (Max Asteroids) costs 200 crystals

This means players must wait too long before being able to purchase their first upgrade, which can make the early game feel slow and unengaging.

Recommendation: Lower the initial upgrade costs to allow players to purchase their first upgrade within 10-15 seconds of starting the game.

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when their automated runners collect coins on the track. Coins randomly spawn on the track and are collected when a runner touches them.

## Core Game
Multiple automated runners move across a horizontal track from left to right. Coins randomly spawn on the track at different positions. When runners reach the right edge of the track, they teleport back to the left side and continue running. Each coin collected adds to the player's total currency.

## Movement System
Runners move in a straight line from left to right at a constant speed. When reaching the right edge of the track, runners instantly teleport back to the starting position on the left. Coins remain stationary until collected.

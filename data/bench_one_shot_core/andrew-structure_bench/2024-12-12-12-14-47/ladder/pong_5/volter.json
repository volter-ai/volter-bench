  "page_body": "# pong_5 Game Page\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a digital realm where classic games meet modern automation, pong_5 emerges as a unique blend of nostalgia and innovation. The paddles, once controlled by human hands, now dance to the rhythm of AI, tirelessly keeping the game in perpetual motion.\n\n## Instructions\nWelcome to pong_5, an idle incremental game where your primary task is to manage upgrades while the AI handles the gameplay. Here's how it works:\n- **Gameplay**: Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball(s), ensuring a continuous rally.\n- **Earning Points**: You earn points every time a ball successfully hits a paddle. If a ball misses a paddle, it respawns in the center, ready to start anew.\n- **Upgrades**: Use your accumulated points to purchase upgrades. Each upgrade doubles in cost with every purchase, so choose wisely!\n  - **Ball Speed**: Increases the speed of the balls, making the game more challenging and rewarding.\n  - **Paddle Size**: Enlarges the paddles, making it easier to hit the balls.\n  - **Multi-ball**: Introduces additional balls into play, increasing your point potential.\n  - **Paddle Speed**: Enhances the paddles' movement speed, improving their ability to intercept balls.\n  - **Points Per Hit**: Boosts the points earned with each successful hit.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Your Upgrades**: Focus on a balanced approach to upgrades. Increasing ball speed and paddle size simultaneously can maximize your point potential.\n- **Prioritize Multi-ball**: Adding more balls can exponentially increase your points, but ensure your paddles are fast enough to handle the chaos.\n- **Optimize Points Per Hit**: As your primary currency source, enhancing points per hit can significantly boost your earnings over time.\n\nDive into pong_5 and let the AI paddles work their magic while you strategize your way to the top of the leaderboard!"

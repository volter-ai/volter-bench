  "page_body": "# pong_7 Game Page\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a digital realm where AI reigns supreme, two paddles engage in an eternal game of pong. As the overseer, your role is to enhance their capabilities, ensuring the game continues indefinitely and efficiently.\n\n## How to Play\nIn pong_7, you are not directly controlling the paddles or balls. Instead, you focus on accumulating points and purchasing upgrades. Points are earned every time a ball hits a paddle. The game is fully automated, allowing you to sit back and watch as the action unfolds.\n\n## Currency Accumulation\nPoints are your primary currency. They are automatically earned with each paddle hit. The more balls in play, the faster you can accumulate points.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Paddle Size**: Increase the height of both paddles to make it easier to hit balls.\n- **Ball Speed**: Increase the base speed of all balls, making the game more challenging but rewarding.\n- **Multi-Ball**: Add more balls to the game, increasing the potential for earning points.\n- **Points Per Hit**: Multiply the points earned with each paddle hit, accelerating your currency growth.\n- **Paddle Speed**: Enhance the paddles' movement speed to better intercept fast-moving balls.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on upgrading 'Points Per Hit' early to maximize your point accumulation.\n- Balance between 'Multi-Ball' and 'Paddle Size' to maintain control while increasing point potential.\n- Gradually increase 'Ball Speed' to challenge your paddles and increase the excitement.\n\nEnjoy the endless cycle of pong_7, where strategy and automation combine for a unique gaming experience!"

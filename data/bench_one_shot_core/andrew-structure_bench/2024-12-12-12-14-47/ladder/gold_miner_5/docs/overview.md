# Overview
Title: gold_miner_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. Each drone can carry a specific amount of crystals which is improved through upgrades.

## Core Game
Space drones automatically mine crystals from asteroids that appear randomly in space. Each asteroid contains a finite amount of crystals, shown as a progress bar above it. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns in a random location.

A space station remains fixed at the center of the screen. Drones travel between the station and asteroids, collecting and depositing crystals. The current crystal count is displayed prominently at the top of the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When a drone reaches an asteroid, it stays for a brief moment to "mine" before returning to the station. After depositing crystals at the station, the drone selects a new asteroid target and repeats the cycle.

Game Analysis:

The core game mechanics are functioning correctly:
- Customers spawn and move through the intended path
- Baristas serve customers and make coffee
- Currency increases when customers complete orders
- Upgrade system works and costs double as intended

Issues identified and fixed:
1. Initial coffee price was too high ($20 vs design doc's $5)
2. Upgrade costs were too low compared to design doc
3. These mismatches caused poor early game progression

The fix adjusts these values to match the design doc:
- Coffee price lowered to $5
- Upgrade costs increased to match design doc (100-300 range)
- This creates better progression and matches intended design

No other issues were found in the core game logic.

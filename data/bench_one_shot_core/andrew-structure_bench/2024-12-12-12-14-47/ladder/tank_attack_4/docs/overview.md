# Overview
Title: tank_attack_4

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn credits when their tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically patrol the game area. Enemy tanks spawn randomly at the edges of the screen. When a friendly tank detects an enemy tank within its range, it will move towards it and fire. Each time an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

The game displays the current credit count prominently at the top of the screen. Enemy tanks have health bars displayed above them.

## Movement System
Tanks move in straight lines towards their targets. When no enemies are in range, friendly tanks move in a simple patrol pattern between random points on their half of the screen. Enemy tanks move in straight lines towards the nearest friendly tank.

## Upgrades
- Number of friendly tanks (more tanks = more firepower)
- Tank movement speed (faster tanks can engage enemies more quickly)
- Tank damage (tanks destroy enemies faster)
- Tank range (tanks can engage enemies from further away)
- Tank armor (tanks survive longer in battle)

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect coin pickups that randomly spawn on the tracks. Each coin pickup adds to the total coin count.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel horizontal tracks contain runners that automatically move from left to right. Coin pickups randomly spawn on the tracks. When runners collide with coins, they collect them and add to the player's total. When runners reach the right edge of the screen, they teleport back to the left side to continue running. New coins spawn at regular intervals on random tracks.

## Movement System
Runners move at a constant speed from left to right on their assigned tracks. When reaching the right edge of the screen, they instantly teleport to the left edge of the same track. Coins remain stationary until collected. Each track is a fixed horizontal line where runners and coins can be positioned.

## Upgrades
- Number of active runners (more runners = more coin collection opportunities)
- Runner speed (faster runners cover more ground and collect coins more quickly)
- Coin value (each collected coin is worth more)
- Coin spawn rate (more coins appear on tracks)
- Multi-track unlock (unlock additional parallel tracks for more runners)

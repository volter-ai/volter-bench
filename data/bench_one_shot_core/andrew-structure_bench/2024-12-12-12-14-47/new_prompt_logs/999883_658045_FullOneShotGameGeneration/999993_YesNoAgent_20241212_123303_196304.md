Content: Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that:
1. Currency stays at 0 for first ~13 seconds
2. Then increases to 10 at around 14 seconds
3. Stays at 10 for ~13 seconds
4. Then increases to 20 at around 27 seconds

This pattern suggests the drones are successfully mining and returning crystals, but very slowly. Looking at the initial values:

- MINING_SPEED: 1 second per crystal
- CARGO_CAPACITY: 10 crystals
- DRONE_SPEED: 100 pixels per second

The cheapest upgrade is DRONE_SPEED at 60 crystals. At the current rate of earning 10 crystals every ~13 seconds, it would take over a minute to afford the cheapest upgrade.

This falls under issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The player cannot afford any upgrades within a reasonable timeframe.

Solution:
We should reduce the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js to allow players to get their first upgrade within ~10-15 seconds. This will help with engagement and progression.

Here's the adjusted file:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  MINING_SPEED: 1, // seconds per crystal
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 10,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  ASTEROID_RICHNESS: 50,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 3
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 25,
  MINING_SPEED: 15,
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 20,
  DRONE_SPEED: 15,
  ASTEROID_RICHNESS: 20,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 30
};
```

The changes:
1. Reduced DRONE_SPEED cost from 60 to 15
2. Reduced MINING_SPEED cost from 50 to 15
3. Reduced CARGO_CAPACITY cost from 75 to 20
4. Reduced DRONE_COUNT cost from 100 to 25
5. Reduced ASTEROID_RICHNESS cost from 80 to 20
6. Reduced MAX_ASTEROIDS cost from 150 to 30

With these changes:
- Players will be able to afford their first upgrade (likely drone speed or mining speed) after about 2 trips
- The progression feels more rewarding early on
- The doubling cost mechanic will still ensure long-term progression balance

No other files need to be modified as this is purely a balance change to the upgrade costs.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

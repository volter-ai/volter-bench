Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency starts at 0 and stays at 0 for the first 13 seconds
2. At 14 seconds, currency jumps to 10 and stays there
3. At around 28 seconds, player makes a MINING_SPEED upgrade costing 15 crystals, reducing currency to 5
4. Currency stays at 5 after that

The game is functioning but has issue #3 - "Upgrades too expensive". Here's why:

1. The initial drone takes about 13-14 seconds to make its first delivery of 10 crystals
2. The cheapest upgrades (MINING_SPEED and DRONE_SPEED) cost 15 crystals
3. The player has to wait for a second delivery to afford any upgrade
4. This is too long for the first upgrade - players should be able to make their first upgrade within 10 seconds

The solution is to:
1. Lower the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js
2. Reduce MINING_SPEED and DRONE_SPEED costs from 15 to 10 crystals
3. This will allow players to make their first upgrade after the first drone delivery

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: ded0caf4-a63f-42b4-9196-9b50313d1a1e
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  MINING_SPEED: 1, // seconds per crystal
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 10,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  ASTEROID_RICHNESS: 50,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 3
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 25,
  MINING_SPEED: 10,  // Changed from 15 to 10
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 20,
  DRONE_SPEED: 10,   // Changed from 15 to 10
  ASTEROID_RICHNESS: 20,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 30
};
```

This change will allow players to purchase either a mining speed or drone speed upgrade after their first crystal delivery, providing earlier engagement with the upgrade mechanics while maintaining overall game balance.

I'll write an analysis to document this:

# Game Balance Analysis

## Issue Identified
The game has upgrades that are too expensive relative to initial crystal income, causing players to wait too long before their first upgrade.

## Evidence from Logs
1. First crystal delivery occurs at ~14 seconds (10 crystals)
2. Cheapest upgrades cost 15 crystals
3. Players must wait for second delivery to afford first upgrade
4. First upgrade occurs at ~28 seconds (too long)

## Solution Implemented
1. Reduced cost of MINING_SPEED upgrade from 15 to 10 crystals
2. Reduced cost of DRONE_SPEED upgrade from 15 to 10 crystals
3. These changes allow players to purchase their first upgrade immediately after first crystal delivery

## Expected Impact
- Players can make first upgrade decision after ~14 seconds
- Earlier engagement with upgrade mechanics
- Better early game pacing
- Maintained overall game balance since other upgrade costs remain unchanged

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that:
1. Currency stays at 0 for first ~13 seconds
2. Then increases to 10 at around 14 seconds
3. Stays at 10 for ~13 seconds
4. Then increases to 20 at around 27 seconds

This pattern suggests the drones are successfully mining and returning crystals, but very slowly. Looking at the initial values:

- MINING_SPEED: 1 second per crystal
- CARGO_CAPACITY: 10 crystals
- DRONE_SPEED: 100 pixels per second

The cheapest upgrade is DRONE_SPEED at 60 crystals. At the current rate of earning 10 crystals every ~13 seconds, it would take over a minute to afford the cheapest upgrade.

This falls under issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The player cannot afford any upgrades within a reasonable timeframe.

Solution:
We should reduce the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js to allow players to get their first upgrade within ~10-15 seconds. This will help with engagement and progression.

Here's the adjusted file:

# Excerpt ID: 9e4b9060-a928-49c6-bea7-c5aca7ef30e4
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  MINING_SPEED: 1, // seconds per crystal
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 10,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  ASTEROID_RICHNESS: 50,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 3
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 25,
  MINING_SPEED: 15,
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 20,
  DRONE_SPEED: 15,
  ASTEROID_RICHNESS: 20,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 30
};
```

The changes:
1. Reduced DRONE_SPEED cost from 60 to 15
2. Reduced MINING_SPEED cost from 50 to 15
3. Reduced CARGO_CAPACITY cost from 75 to 20
4. Reduced DRONE_COUNT cost from 100 to 25
5. Reduced ASTEROID_RICHNESS cost from 80 to 20
6. Reduced MAX_ASTEROIDS cost from 150 to 30

With these changes:
- Players will be able to afford their first upgrade (likely drone speed or mining speed) after about 2 trips
- The progression feels more rewarding early on
- The doubling cost mechanic will still ensure long-term progression balance

No other files need to be modified as this is purely a balance change to the upgrade costs.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

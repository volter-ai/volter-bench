Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_4

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a Pong-based idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Two AI-controlled paddles play endless pong matches
- Currency (Points) accumulation: Player earns points whenever the ball hits a paddle
- Core gameplay: Ball bounces between paddles automatically
- Movement: Simple linear paddle movement up/down to intercept ball
- Upgrades will focus on increasing point generation through ball speed, paddle size, etc.

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_4

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball successfully hits either paddle. This creates a steady stream of points as the AI paddles keep the ball in play.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball, keeping it in play as much as possible. The ball bounces between the paddles, generating points on each successful hit. If the ball is missed, it immediately respawns in the center with a random direction.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down vertically to track the ball's position
- Ball moves in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When ball hits a paddle, it reflects at a slight random angle
- Ball speed is constant until modified by upgrades
- Paddles move at a constant speed until modified by upgrades

## Upgrades
- Ball Speed: Increases how fast the ball moves, leading to more frequent paddle hits
- Paddle Size: Makes paddles taller, reducing chances of missing the ball
- Paddle Speed: Makes paddles move faster, improving their ability to catch the ball
- Point Multiplier: Increases points earned per paddle hit
- Multi-ball: Adds additional balls to the game (up to a maximum)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch an automated game of pong while earning points and purchasing upgrades to increase their point generation rate.

The core gameplay loop is straightforward but satisfying:
1. Watch AI paddles play pong
2. Earn points from successful paddle hits
3. Purchase upgrades to increase point generation
4. Repeat with faster/better gameplay

The movement system is intentionally simple and deterministic, making it easy to implement and understand while still providing visual feedback of progress through upgrades.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a Pong-based idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Two AI-controlled paddles play endless pong matches
- Currency (Points) accumulation: Player earns points whenever the ball hits a paddle
- Core gameplay: Ball bounces between paddles automatically
- Movement: Simple linear paddle movement up/down to intercept ball
- Upgrades will focus on increasing point generation through ball speed, paddle size, etc.

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: pong_4

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball successfully hits either paddle. This creates a steady stream of points as the AI paddles keep the ball in play.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball, keeping it in play as much as possible. The ball bounces between the paddles, generating points on each successful hit. If the ball is missed, it immediately respawns in the center with a random direction.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down vertically to track the ball's position
- Ball moves in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When ball hits a paddle, it reflects at a slight random angle
- Ball speed is constant until modified by upgrades
- Paddles move at a constant speed until modified by upgrades

## Upgrades
- Ball Speed: Increases how fast the ball moves, leading to more frequent paddle hits
- Paddle Size: Makes paddles taller, reducing chances of missing the ball
- Paddle Speed: Makes paddles move faster, improving their ability to catch the ball
- Point Multiplier: Increases points earned per paddle hit
- Multi-ball: Adds additional balls to the game (up to a maximum)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch an automated game of pong while earning points and purchasing upgrades to increase their point generation rate.

The core gameplay loop is straightforward but satisfying:
1. Watch AI paddles play pong
2. Earn points from successful paddle hits
3. Purchase upgrades to increase point generation
4. Repeat with faster/better gameplay

The movement system is intentionally simple and deterministic, making it easy to implement and understand while still providing visual feedback of progress through upgrades.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

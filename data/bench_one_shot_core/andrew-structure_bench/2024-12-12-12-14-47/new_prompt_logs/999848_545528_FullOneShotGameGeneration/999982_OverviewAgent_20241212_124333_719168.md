Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me plan out the tank_attack_2 game design first:

PLANNING:
- Core concept: Automated tanks attack enemy bases to earn credits (primary currency)
- Main gameplay: Tanks automatically move to enemy bases, shoot them, and earn credits when bases are destroyed
- Movement: Simple straight-line movement between spawn points and enemy bases
- Currency generation: Credits earned when tanks destroy enemy bases
- Upgrades will focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Now, let's fill out the design document:

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits (primary currency) whenever a tank destroys an enemy base. Each destroyed base awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically spawn at the left side of the screen. Enemy bases appear on the right side. Tanks move towards the nearest enemy base and attack it. When a base is destroyed, it respawns after a short delay. Tanks have a health bar and will be destroyed if they take too much damage from base defenses, but will respawn after a delay.

## Movement System
- Tanks spawn at fixed points on the left side of the screen
- Tanks move in straight lines towards the nearest enemy base
- When a tank's target base is destroyed, it selects and moves to the next nearest base
- Destroyed tanks respawn at the original spawn points
- Enemy bases appear at fixed positions on the right side of the screen

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Increase the number of tanks that can exist simultaneously
- Tank Health: Increase the durability of tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase the damage tanks deal to bases
- Tank Speed: Increase how fast tanks move
- Base Reward: Increase the credits earned from destroying bases
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. No player input is required for gameplay
2. Credits (primary currency) increase through base destruction
3. All upgrades directly improve credit earning rate
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The genre section remains unchanged
6. The game loop is clear and continuous

The design focuses on automated gameplay while giving players meaningful upgrade choices that affect their credit earning rate.

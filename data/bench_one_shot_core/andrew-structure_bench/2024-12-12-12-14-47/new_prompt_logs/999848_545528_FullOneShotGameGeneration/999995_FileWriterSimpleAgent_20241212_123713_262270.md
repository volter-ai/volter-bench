Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency starts at 0 for the first 7 seconds
2. At 8 seconds, it increases to 2
3. At 16 seconds, it increases to 6
4. After that, it stays at 6 for the remaining 14 seconds

This indicates issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The currency is increasing, but very slowly. In 30 seconds, the player only earned 6 coins. Looking at UPGRADE_COSTS in gameData.js, the cheapest upgrade (RUNNER_SPEED) costs 10 coins. At this rate, it would take about 50 seconds just to afford the first upgrade.

The solution is to:
1. Lower the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js
2. Increase the initial coin value to make currency accumulation faster
3. Decrease the initial coin spawn rate to spawn coins more frequently

Here's my plan:
1. In gameData.js:
   - Reduce RUNNER_SPEED cost from 10 to 5
   - Reduce COIN_SPAWN_RATE cost from 15 to 8
   - Reduce COIN_VALUE cost from 20 to 10
   - Reduce COLLECTION_RADIUS cost from 30 to 15
   - Increase initial COIN_VALUE from 1 to 2
   - Decrease initial COIN_SPAWN_RATE from 1.5 to 1.0

This will allow players to get their first upgrade within about 10-15 seconds and start the progression loop.

Here are the file changes:

# Excerpt ID: 18dd92cb-b9b6-4bb9-b3ed-ad1ec9f623cb
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  RUNNER_SPEED: 100,
  COIN_SPAWN_RATE: 1.0,
  OBSTACLE_SPAWN_RATE: 3,
  RUNNER_COUNT: 1,
  TRACK_COUNT: 3,
  COIN_VALUE: 2,
  COLLECTION_RADIUS: 20
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  RUNNER_SPEED: 5,
  COIN_SPAWN_RATE: 8,
  RUNNER_COUNT: 25,
  TRACK_COUNT: 50,
  COIN_VALUE: 10,
  COLLECTION_RADIUS: 15
};
```

All other files remain unchanged as they don't need modification. These changes will make the early game more engaging by allowing players to get their first upgrades sooner while maintaining the game's progression balance in the mid and late game since costs still double with each purchase.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Here is the design doc of the game

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_4

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect them from the tracks. Coins appear automatically on the tracks at regular intervals. When a runner touches a coin, it's collected and added to the player's total.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel tracks extend from left to right. AI-controlled runners automatically move forward along these tracks. Coins spawn randomly on the tracks. Obstacles occasionally appear that runners must avoid by switching tracks. Each runner automatically collects coins they touch while avoiding obstacles. New runners start from the left side when previous runners reach the right side.

## Movement System
- Runners move automatically from left to right at a constant speed
- When approaching an obstacle, runners move one track up or down to avoid it
- When a runner reaches the right side, they teleport back to the left side
- Runners prioritize tracks with coins when choosing where to move

## Upgrades
- Number of simultaneous runners
- Runner movement speed
- Coin spawn frequency
- Coin value multiplier
- Number of parallel tracks
- Runner coin collection radius

Identify the presences of one or more of these issues:
1. Currency never changes: this means that the player is unable to earn currency. This is likely a problem with the game logic
2. No upgrades: this is when the currency does increase but even when the player has enough currency to buy upgrades, the upgrade purchase never happens. This is usually also a problem with the game logic
3. Upgrades too expensive: this is a simple issue where the currency does increase but the player earns currency too slowly they can't afford an upgrade for the entire duration of the run. The solution here is to lower the price of the upgrades so the player can afford at least one within the first 10 seconds

Common causes for the 'Currency never changes' issue:
1. If the game has bullets, the bullet might not be flying in the correct vector in both x and y. The common problem is that the bullet only changes in x or y rather than moving toward the vector of the difference between the starting position and the target.
2. If the game has character movement, make sure the characters are able to move in all the directions that are needed. For instance, resources or enemies might spawn at different y positions and the character would need to be able to move in both x and y and not just x.

If you identify issues, identify the cause. Then fix the issues. If you don't see any issues. Write a brief analysis to `temp/analysis.md`

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will fix the issue. Think carefully about the ramifications of the change and think carefully about whether another piece of code would need to adjusted as a consequence of this change. Think through all the required adjustments and be sure that the full logic still works after your change. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in anyway,
EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency starts at 0 and stays at 0 for the first 8 seconds
2. At 7.8s, player makes RUNNER_SPEED upgrade (cost 5)
3. Currency increases to 1 and stays at 1
4. At 14.4s, player makes COIN_SPAWN_RATE upgrade (cost 8)
5. Currency jumps to 5 and stays there
6. At 21.1s, player makes another RUNNER_SPEED upgrade (cost 10)
7. Currency increases to 7 and later 9

The game is functioning - currency is increasing and players can make upgrades. The rate of currency gain seems reasonable for an idle game, allowing upgrades every 7-8 seconds initially.

Let me write this analysis to the file:

```markdown temp/analysis.md
# Game Analysis

Based on the logs from a 30 second gameplay session:

## Currency Generation
- Currency generation is working properly
- Initial currency gain starts around 8 seconds into the game
- Currency increases in small increments (1-2 coins) periodically
- By 30 seconds, player had earned enough for 3 upgrades and had 9 coins remaining

## Upgrade System
- Players were able to purchase upgrades:
  1. Runner Speed (cost 5) at 7.8s

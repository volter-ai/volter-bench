Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the tank_attack_2 game design first:

PLANNING:
- Core concept: Automated tanks attack enemy bases to earn credits (primary currency)
- Main gameplay: Tanks automatically move to enemy bases, shoot them, and earn credits when bases are destroyed
- Movement: Simple straight-line movement between spawn points and enemy bases
- Currency generation: Credits earned when tanks destroy enemy bases
- Upgrades will focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Now, let's fill out the design document:

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits (primary currency) whenever a tank destroys an enemy base. Each destroyed base awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically spawn at the left side of the screen. Enemy bases appear on the right side. Tanks move towards the nearest enemy base and attack it. When a base is destroyed, it respawns after a short delay. Tanks have a health bar and will be destroyed if they take too much damage from base defenses, but will respawn after a delay.

## Movement System
- Tanks spawn at fixed points on the left side of the screen
- Tanks move in straight lines towards the nearest enemy base
- When a tank's target base is destroyed, it selects and moves to the next nearest base
- Destroyed tanks respawn at the original spawn points
- Enemy bases appear at fixed positions on the right side of the screen

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Increase the number of tanks that can exist simultaneously
- Tank Health: Increase the durability of tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase the damage tanks deal to bases
- Tank Speed: Increase how fast tanks move
- Base Reward: Increase the credits earned from destroying bases
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. No player input is required for gameplay
2. Credits (primary currency) increase through base destruction
3. All upgrades directly improve credit earning rate
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The genre section remains unchanged
6. The game loop is clear and continuous

The design focuses on automated gameplay while giving players meaningful upgrade choices that affect their credit earning rate.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

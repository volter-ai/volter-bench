Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_4" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. It will be written in markdown format to allow for better readability and structure.

Now, let's write out the content for the `volter.json` file:

# Excerpt ID: 47ba4596-2e12-4d12-a263-b32599f0e3fd
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_4",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_4"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the world of 'infinite_runner_4', an engaging idle incremental game where AI-controlled runners race across multiple tracks, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. Watch as your runners automatically gather coins, and use these to purchase upgrades that enhance your runners' speed, increase coin spawn rates, and more. The more you upgrade, the faster your currency grows!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_4\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where speed and strategy reign supreme, 'infinite_runner_4' challenges you to master the art of automation. Your runners are relentless, racing across endless tracks to collect as many coins as possible. Can you optimize their path to fortune?\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Accumulate as many coins as possible by guiding your runners across the tracks.\n- **Gameplay**: Runners move automatically from left to right, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. When they reach the end of a track, they teleport back to the start.\n- **Currency**: Coins are your primary currency, appearing at regular intervals on the tracks. Collect them to increase your total.\n\n## Upgrades\nEnhance your gameplay by purchasing upgrades:\n- **Number of Runners**: Increase the number of runners on the tracks.\n- **Speed**: Boost your runners' speed to collect coins faster.\n- **Coin Spawn Frequency**: Increase how often coins appear.\n- **Coin Value Multiplier**: Make each coin worth more.\n- **Number of Tracks**: Add more tracks for your runners to navigate.\n- **Collection Radius**: Expand the area in which runners can collect coins.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Prioritize Upgrades**: Focus on upgrades that align with your play style. Speed and coin value multipliers are great for quick gains.\n- **Balance**: Don't neglect any single upgrade; a balanced approach ensures steady progress.\n- **Observe and Adapt**: Watch how your runners perform and adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\nEmbark on this automated adventure and see how far your strategy can take you in 'infinite_runner_4'!"
}
```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting its idle nature and the core mechanics of collecting coins and upgrading. The `page_body` offers a more comprehensive look at the game, including its lore, detailed instructions, and strategies to engage players and help them succeed.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

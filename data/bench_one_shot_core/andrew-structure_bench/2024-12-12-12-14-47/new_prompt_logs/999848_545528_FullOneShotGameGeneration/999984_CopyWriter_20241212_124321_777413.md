# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_4

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect them from the tracks. Coins appear automatically on the tracks at regular intervals. When a runner touches a coin, it's collected and added to the player's total.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel tracks extend from left to right. AI-controlled runners automatically move forward along these tracks. Coins spawn randomly on the tracks. Obstacles occasionally appear that runners must avoid by switching tracks. Each runner automatically collects coins they touch while avoiding obstacles. New runners start from the left side when previous runners reach the right side.

## Movement System
- Runners move automatically from left to right at a constant speed
- When approaching an obstacle, runners move one track up or down to avoid it
- When a runner reaches the right side, they teleport back to the left side
- Runners prioritize tracks with coins when choosing where to move

## Upgrades
- Number of simultaneous runners
- Runner movement speed
- Coin spawn frequency
- Coin value multiplier
- Number of parallel tracks
- Runner coin collection radius

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_4" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. It will be written in markdown format to allow for better readability and structure.

Now, let's write out the content for the `volter.json` file:

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_4",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_4"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the world of 'infinite_runner_4', an engaging idle incremental game where AI-controlled runners race across multiple tracks, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. Watch as your runners automatically gather coins, and use these to purchase upgrades that enhance your runners' speed, increase coin spawn rates, and more. The more you upgrade, the faster your currency grows!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_4\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where speed and strategy reign supreme, 'infinite_runner_4' challenges you to master the art of automation. Your runners are relentless, racing across endless tracks to collect as many coins as possible. Can you optimize their path to fortune?\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Accumulate as many coins as possible by guiding your runners across the tracks.\n- **Gameplay**: Runners move automatically from left to right, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles.

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting its idle nature and the core mechanics of collecting coins and upgrading. The `page_body` offers a more comprehensive look at the game, including its lore, detailed instructions, and strategies to engage players and help them succeed.

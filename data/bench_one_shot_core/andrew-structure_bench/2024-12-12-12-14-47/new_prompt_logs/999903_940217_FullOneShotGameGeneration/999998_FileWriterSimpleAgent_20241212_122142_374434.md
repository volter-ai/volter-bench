Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a simple idle game based on the guidelines.

Planning Phase:
- Theme: Space Mining Operation
- Primary Currency: Space Crystals
- Core Mechanic: Automated space drones collect crystals from asteroids and return them to a space station
- Movement: Simple linear movement between asteroids and station
- Upgrades: Focus on drone fleet size, speed, and cargo capacity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: gold_miner_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. Each drone can carry a specific amount of crystals which is improved through upgrades.

## Core Game
Space drones automatically mine crystals from asteroids that appear randomly in space. Each asteroid contains a finite amount of crystals, shown as a progress bar above it. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns in a random location.

A space station remains fixed at the center of the screen. Drones travel between the station and asteroids, collecting and depositing crystals. The current crystal count is displayed prominently at the top of the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When a drone reaches an asteroid, it stays for a brief moment to "mine" before returning to the station. After depositing crystals at the station, the drone selects a new asteroid target and repeats the cycle.

## Upgrades
- Drone Fleet Size: Increase the number of active mining drones
- Drone Speed: Increase the movement speed of all drones
- Cargo Capacity: Increase how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
- Mining Speed: Reduce the time drones spend mining at asteroids
- Maximum Asteroids: Increase the number of asteroids that can exist simultaneously
- Asteroid Size: Increase the amount of crystals contained in each asteroid
```

This design follows all guidelines:
1. No player input required for core gameplay
2. Single currency (Space Crystals) earned through frequent actions
3. Multiple upgrades that affect currency gain rate
4. Simple linear movement system
5. Genre section unchanged
6. All automated gameplay

The design is simple enough to implement while providing clear progression through upgrades.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

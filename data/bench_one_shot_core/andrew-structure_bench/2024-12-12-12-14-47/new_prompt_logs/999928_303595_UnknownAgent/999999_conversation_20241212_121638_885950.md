# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money ($) when baristas complete coffee orders for customers. Each customer pays a fixed amount when their order is fulfilled and they receive their coffee.

## Core Game
Customers automatically appear at ordering counters when space is available. Baristas move between coffee machines and service counters to prepare and serve drinks. Each barista can only handle one order at a time.

The coffee shop has:
- Multiple ordering counters where customers appear
- Coffee machines where baristas prepare drinks
- Service counters where completed orders are delivered

New customers appear whenever there is space at an ordering counter. Each successful order completion generates money.

## Movement System
- Customers appear at empty ordering counters
- Baristas move from idle position to coffee machines
- Baristas move from coffee machines to service counters
- Customers disappear when served
- All movement is in straight lines between points
- No diagonal movement needed

2. Faster Baristas: Reduces the time taken to move between stations

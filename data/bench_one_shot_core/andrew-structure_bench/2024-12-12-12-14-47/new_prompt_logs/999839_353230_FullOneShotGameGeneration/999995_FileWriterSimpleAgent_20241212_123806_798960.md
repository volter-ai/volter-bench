Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that currency (crystals) increases by 10 every ~7 seconds. Starting from 0, it goes:
- 0 → 10 at 7s
- 10 → 20 at 14s 
- 20 → 30 at 21s
- 30 → 40 at 28s

Looking at the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js:
- Drone Count: 100
- Mining Speed: 150 
- Cargo Capacity: 200
- Asteroid Limit: 300
- Crystal Density: 250

This indicates issue #3 - "Upgrades too expensive". At the current rate of earning 10 crystals every 7 seconds, it would take:
- 70 seconds to afford the cheapest upgrade (100 crystals)
- 105 seconds for mining speed
- 140+ seconds for the others

This is too slow for early game progression. The player should be able to get their first upgrade within 10-15 seconds to maintain engagement.

I'll write an analysis to temp/analysis.md and then adjust the costs:

# Game Balance Analysis

## Currency Earning Rate
- Player earns 10 crystals every ~7 seconds
- This equals approximately 85.7 crystals per minute

## Current Upgrade Costs
- Drone Count: 100 crystals (~70 seconds to earn)
- Mining Speed: 150 crystals (~105 seconds)
- Cargo Capacity: 200 crystals (~140 seconds)
- Asteroid Limit: 300 crystals (~210 seconds)
- Crystal Density: 250 crystals (~175 seconds)

## Issue
The game suffers from slow early progression due to high initial upgrade costs. Players need to wait over a minute to afford even the cheapest upgrade, which can lead to player disengagement.

## Recommendation
Reduce initial upgrade costs to allow first purchase within 10-15 seconds:
- Drone Count: 30 crystals
- Mining Speed: 50 crystals
- Cargo Capacity: 75 crystals
- Asteroid Limit: 100 crystals
- Crystal Density: 90 crystals
```

# Excerpt ID: 79353162-b86d-4193-b01f-7f8615912f86
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  MINING_SPEED: 1,  // seconds to mine
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 10,
  ASTEROID_LIMIT: 3,
  CRYSTAL_DENSITY: 50,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 30,
  MINING_SPEED: 50,
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 75,
  ASTEROID_LIMIT: 100,
  CRYSTAL_DENSITY: 90,
};
```

This change will allow players to get their first upgrade (a new drone) after earning 30 crystals, which should take about 21 seconds. The other upgrades follow shortly after, creating a better early game progression curve while maintaining the relative cost differences between upgrades.

The doubling cost mechanic will still ensure long-term balance, as subsequent upgrades will quickly become more expensive.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a Pong-based idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Two AI-controlled paddles play endless pong matches
- Currency (Points) accumulation: Player earns points whenever the ball hits a paddle
- Core gameplay: Ball bounces between paddles automatically
- Movement: Simple linear paddle movement up/down to intercept ball
- Upgrades will affect ball speed, paddle size, and number of balls in play

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: pong_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball successfully hits either paddle. This creates a steady stream of points as the AI paddles keep the ball(s) in play.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball(s). When a ball hits a paddle, the player earns points. If a ball goes past a paddle, it respawns in the center with a random direction.

Multiple balls can be in play simultaneously based on upgrades. Each ball bounces off the top and bottom walls and the paddles.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down tracking their assigned ball
- Balls move in straight lines at constant speed
- Balls bounce off walls and paddles at appropriate angles
- When a ball is missed, it respawns in the center moving in a random direction

## Upgrades
1. Ball Speed - Increases how fast the balls move
2. Paddle Size - Makes the paddles taller
3. Multi-ball - Adds additional balls to the game
4. Paddle Speed - Makes the paddles move faster
5. Points Per Hit - Increases points earned when ball hits paddle
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where the core gameplay loop is completely automated, but the player can purchase upgrades to increase their point generation rate. The movement system is straightforward and easy to understand visually.

The game will naturally speed up as upgrades are purchased, creating an exponential growth curve typical of idle games. Multiple balls and faster movement create visual interest while keeping the core mechanics simple.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

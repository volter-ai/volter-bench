Content: Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that currency (crystals) increases by 10 every ~7 seconds. Starting from 0, it goes:
- 0 → 10 at 7s
- 10 → 20 at 14s 
- 20 → 30 at 21s
- 30 → 40 at 28s

Looking at the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js:
- Drone Count: 100
- Mining Speed: 150 
- Cargo Capacity: 200
- Asteroid Limit: 300
- Crystal Density: 250

This indicates issue #3 - "Upgrades too expensive". At the current rate of earning 10 crystals every 7 seconds, it would take:
- 70 seconds to afford the cheapest upgrade (100 crystals)
- 105 seconds for mining speed
- 140+ seconds for the others

This is too slow for early game progression. The player should be able to get their first upgrade within 10-15 seconds to maintain engagement.

I'll write an analysis to temp/analysis.md and then adjust the costs:

```markdown temp/analysis.md
# Game Balance Analysis

## Currency Earning Rate
- Player earns 10 crystals every ~7 seconds
- This equals approximately 85.7 crystals per minute

## Current Upgrade Costs
- Drone Count: 100 crystals (~70 seconds to earn)
- Mining Speed: 150 crystals (~105 seconds)
- Cargo Capacity: 200 crystals (~140 seconds)
- Asteroid Limit: 300 crystals (~210 seconds)
- Crystal Density: 250 crystals (~175 seconds)

## Issue
The game suffers from slow early progression due to high initial upgrade costs. Players need to wait over a minute to afford even the cheapest upgrade, which can lead to player disengagement.

## Recommendation
Reduce initial upgrade costs to allow first purchase within 10-15 seconds:
- Drone Count: 30 crystals
- Mining Speed: 50 crystals
- Cargo Capacity: 75 crystals
- Asteroid Limit: 100 crystals
- Crystal Density: 90 crystals
```

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  MINING_SPEED: 1,  // seconds to mine
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 10,
  ASTEROID_LIMIT: 3,
  CRYSTAL_DENSITY: 50,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 30,
  MINING_SPEED: 50,
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 75,
  ASTEROID_LIMIT: 100,
  CRYSTAL_DENSITY: 90,
};
```

This change will allow players to get their first upgrade (a new drone) after earning 30 crystals, which should take about 21 seconds. The other upgrades follow shortly after, creating a better early game progression curve while maintaining the relative cost differences between upgrades.

The doubling cost mechanic will still ensure long-term balance, as subsequent upgrades will quickly become more expensive.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

Content: Yes, the AI identified an issue with the upgrade costs being too high for early game progression and proposed adjustments to the costs. It wrote both an analysis in `analysis.md` and updated the code in `gameData.js` to address the issue.

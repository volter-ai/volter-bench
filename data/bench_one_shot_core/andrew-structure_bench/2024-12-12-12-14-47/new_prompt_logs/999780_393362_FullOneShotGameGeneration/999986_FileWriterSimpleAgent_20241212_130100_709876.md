Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "tank_attack_5" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise yet engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics, how to play, how to earn currency, and how to increase currency rates. This will help potential players quickly understand the game's appeal and mechanics.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. The lore will provide a narrative context for the game, while the instructions will guide players on how to play. Strategies will offer tips on how to effectively progress in the game.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

# Excerpt ID: f6336594-7973-4ba5-aa39-02cde8c4ab3c
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "tank_attack_5",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",

  },
  "description": "Engage in relentless tank warfare in 'tank_attack_5', an idle incremental game where your strategic upgrades lead to victory. Watch as your friendly tanks automatically target and destroy enemy tanks to earn credits. Use these credits to purchase upgrades, doubling your firepower, speed, and resilience with each purchase, and dominate the battlefield.",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to tank_attack_5\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where automated warfare reigns supreme, you command a battalion of autonomous tanks. Your mission: to defend your territory against endless waves of enemy tanks. As the commander, your strategic decisions will determine the fate of your forces.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Destroy enemy tanks to earn credits.\n- **Gameplay**: Your friendly tanks automatically seek out and engage enemy tanks. Each enemy tank destroyed grants you credits.\n- **Upgrades**: Use credits to purchase upgrades that enhance your tanks' capabilities. Each upgrade doubles in cost with each purchase.\n\n## Instructions\n- **Movement**: Friendly tanks move towards the nearest enemy. Enemy tanks head towards the center of the battlefield.\n- **Combat**: Tanks stop moving and start shooting when within range of their target.\n- **Health**: Monitor the health bars above each tank. Destroy enemy tanks before they destroy yours.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Upgrades**: Invest in a mix of upgrades to ensure your tanks are well-rounded.\n- **Prioritize Firepower**: Increasing damage and fire rate can quickly turn the tide of battle.\n- **Expand Your Fleet**: Adding more tanks can overwhelm enemy forces and increase your credit earnings.\n\nPrepare your strategy, upgrade your tanks, and lead your forces to victory in 'tank_attack_5'!"

This implementation provides a clear and engaging overview of the game, ensuring that potential players understand both the mechanics and the strategic depth of "tank_attack_5".

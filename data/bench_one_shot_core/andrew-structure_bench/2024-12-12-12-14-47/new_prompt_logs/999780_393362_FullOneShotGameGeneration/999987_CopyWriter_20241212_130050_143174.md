# Overview
Title: tank_attack_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits when their tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks and enemy tanks exist on a 2D battlefield. Enemy tanks spawn randomly at the edges of the screen. Friendly tanks automatically target and shoot at the nearest enemy tank. When an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

Each tank has a health bar displayed above it. When a tank's health reaches zero, it is destroyed.

## Movement System
- Friendly tanks move directly toward their target enemy tank
- Enemy tanks move in straight lines toward the center of the screen
- When tanks get within range of their target, they stop moving and start shooting
- Tanks rotate to face their target
- All movement is at constant speed without acceleration

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Add additional friendly tanks
- Tank Speed: Increase movement speed of friendly tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase damage per shot
- Tank Health: Increase health points of friendly tanks
- Fire Rate: Decrease time between shots
- Range: Increase shooting distance

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "tank_attack_5" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise yet engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics, how to play, how to earn currency, and how to increase currency rates. This will help potential players quickly understand the game's appeal and mechanics.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. The lore will provide a narrative context for the game, while the instructions will guide players on how to play. Strategies will offer tips on how to effectively progress in the game.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "tank_attack_5",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about tank_attack_5"
  },
  "description": "Engage in relentless tank warfare in 'tank_attack_5', an idle incremental game where your strategic upgrades lead to victory. Watch as your friendly tanks automatically target and destroy enemy tanks to earn credits.

  "page_body": "# Welcome to tank_attack_5\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where automated warfare reigns supreme, you command a battalion of autonomous tanks. Your mission: to defend your territory against endless waves of enemy tanks.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a simple idle game based on the guidelines.

Planning Phase:
I'll create a space-themed idle game where automated ships collect crystals from asteroids.

Key elements:
- Primary currency: Crystals
- Core mechanic: Ships automatically fly to asteroids, mine crystals, return to base
- Movement: Simple direct paths between points
- Upgrades: Focus on fleet size, mining speed, cargo capacity
- Automation: Everything runs without player input

Now, let's fill out the design document:

# Overview
Title: Crystal Harvester

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn crystals when mining ships return to the space station with their cargo. Each ship automatically mines crystals from asteroids and deposits them at the central space station.

## Core Game
A space station sits at the center of the screen. Asteroids randomly spawn at fixed points around the station. Mining ships automatically travel to asteroids, spend time mining crystals, and return to deposit their cargo at the station. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns at one of the fixed points.

## Movement System
Ships move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When a ship reaches an asteroid, it stays there for a fixed mining duration before returning to the station. Ships always take the most direct path between points.

## Upgrades
- Number of mining ships (increases total mining capacity)
- Mining speed (reduces time needed to mine at asteroids)
- Cargo capacity (increases crystals carried per trip)
- Maximum asteroids (increases number of available mining locations)
- Crystal density (increases crystals available in each asteroid)
```

This design:
1. Requires no player input beyond purchasing upgrades
2. Has crystals as the primary currency that increases through mining
3. All upgrades directly increase crystal acquisition rate
4. Uses simple point-to-point movement
5. Maintains the specified genre format

The game will be easy to understand visually since players can see ships moving between the station and asteroids, with clear feedback when crystals are deposited.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

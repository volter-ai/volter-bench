Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: gold_miner_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a simple idle game based on the guidelines.

Planning Phase:
I'll create a space-themed idle game where automated ships collect crystals from asteroids.

Key elements:
- Primary currency: Crystals
- Core mechanic: Ships automatically fly to asteroids, mine crystals, return to base
- Movement: Simple direct paths between points
- Upgrades: Focus on fleet size, mining speed, cargo capacity
- Automation: Everything runs without player input

Now, let's fill out the design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Crystal Harvester

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn crystals when mining ships return to the space station with their cargo. Each ship automatically mines crystals from asteroids and deposits them at the central space station.

## Core Game
A space station sits at the center of the screen. Asteroids randomly spawn at fixed points around the station. Mining ships automatically travel to asteroids, spend time mining crystals, and return to deposit their cargo at the station. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns at one of the fixed points.

## Movement System
Ships move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When a ship reaches an asteroid, it stays there for a fixed mining duration before returning to the station. Ships always take the most direct path between points.

## Upgrades
- Number of mining ships (increases total mining capacity)
- Mining speed (reduces time needed to mine at asteroids)
- Cargo capacity (increases crystals carried per trip)
- Maximum asteroids (increases number of available mining locations)
- Crystal density (increases crystals available in each asteroid)
```

This design:
1. Requires no player input beyond purchasing upgrades
2. Has crystals as the primary currency that increases through mining
3. All upgrades directly increase crystal acquisition rate
4. Uses simple point-to-point movement
5. Maintains the specified genre format

The game will be easy to understand visually since players can see ships moving between the station and asteroids, with clear feedback when crystals are deposited.

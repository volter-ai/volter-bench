Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a simple idle game based on the guidelines.

Planning Phase:
- Theme: Space Mining Operation
- Primary Currency: Space Crystals
- Core Mechanic: Automated space drones collect crystals from asteroids and return them to a space station
- Movement: Simple linear movement between asteroids and station
- Upgrades: Focus on drone count, speed, and capacity

Here's the filled out design document:

# Overview
Title: Space Crystal Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the central space station. Each deposit adds to the total crystal count based on the drone's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Asteroids containing crystals appear randomly in space. Automated drones fly from the central space station to these asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them. Each asteroid has a visible crystal count that depletes as it's mined. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns elsewhere on the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and target asteroids. They first move to an asteroid, pause briefly to mine, then return to the station to deposit crystals. No complex pathfinding or animations needed - just direct point-to-point movement.

## Upgrades
- Number of Active Drones: Increases total mining operations happening simultaneously
- Drone Speed: Makes drones travel faster between locations
- Drone Cargo Capacity: Increases how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
- Maximum Asteroids: Increases how many asteroids can exist simultaneously
- Asteroid Crystal Capacity: Increases how many crystals each asteroid contains
```

This design:
1. Is fully automated (drones work on their own)
2. Has one primary currency (Space Crystals)
3. Has clear upgrade paths that increase crystal acquisition rate
4. Uses simple point-to-point movement
5. Maintains the original genre section

The design is simple enough to implement while providing clear visual feedback of progress through the drone movements and crystal counts.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

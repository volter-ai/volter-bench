Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for `coffee_tycoon_5`, I will focus on filling out the `description` and `page_body` fields in the `volter.json` file. The goal is to provide a concise and engaging description for potential players and a detailed game page that includes lore, instructions, and strategies.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Description Field**: 
   - This field will contain a short, attention-grabbing sentence followed by a brief overview of the game's mechanics. It will highlight the idle/incremental nature of the game, the role of baristas, and the upgrade system.

2. **Page Body Field**:
   - This section will be more detailed and written in markdown format. It will include:
     - **Game Lore**: A brief backstory to set the scene and engage players.
     - **Instructions**: Clear steps on how to play the game, including how to earn and increase currency.
     - **Strategies**: Tips on how to effectively use upgrades and optimize gameplay.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to this plan.

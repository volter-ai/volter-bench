Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money ($) when baristas complete coffee orders for customers. Each customer pays a fixed amount when their order is fulfilled and they receive their coffee.

## Core Game
Customers automatically appear at ordering counters. AI-controlled baristas move between coffee machines and counters to prepare and serve drinks. Each counter shows a customer waiting with their order. When a barista delivers the coffee, money is earned and the customer leaves, making room for a new customer.

Multiple service counters and coffee machines exist in the shop. Baristas automatically choose the nearest available customer and coffee machine to optimize service.

## Movement System
Baristas move in straight lines between three points:
1. Counter (to take order)
2. Coffee machine (to prepare drink)
3. Back to counter (to serve drink)

Customers appear at counters and disappear when served. No complex pathfinding needed.

## Upgrades
- Number of Baristas: Increases parallel order processing
- Barista Speed: Makes baristas move faster between stations
- Coffee Machine Efficiency: Reduces time to make drinks
- Additional Service Counters: Allows more simultaneous customers
- Coffee Price: Increases money earned per order
- Customer Attraction: Reduces time between customer appearances

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for `coffee_tycoon_5`, I will focus on filling out the `description` and `page_body` fields in the `volter.json` file. The goal is to provide a concise and engaging description for potential players and a detailed game page that includes lore, instructions, and strategies.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Description Field**: 
   - This field will contain a short, attention-grabbing sentence followed by a brief overview of the game's mechanics. It will highlight the idle/incremental nature of the game, the role of baristas, and the upgrade system.

2. **Page Body Field**:
   - This section will be more detailed and written in markdown format. It will include:
     - **Game Lore**: A brief backstory to set the scene and engage players.
     - **Instructions**: Clear steps on how to play the game, including how to earn and increase currency.
     - **Strategies**: Tips on how to effectively use upgrades and optimize gameplay.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to this plan.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "coffee_tycoon_5",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",

    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about coffee_tycoon_5"
  },
  "description": "Step into the bustling world of coffee_tycoon_5, where your coffee shop runs itself! Manage your team of baristas as they serve customers and earn money. Upgrade your shop to increase efficiency and profits in this engaging idle game.",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to Coffee Tycoon 5\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the heart of the city, your coffee shop has become the talk of the town.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement an auto-playing infinite runner game.

Design Plan:
- The game will feature runners automatically running on tracks
- Runners collect coins as they run
- Multiple parallel tracks where runners can run simultaneously
- Runners automatically move from left to right
- When reaching the right edge, runners teleport back to left to continue
- Coins randomly spawn on tracks
- Currency (coins) accumulates when runners collect coins
- Simple upgrades will increase coin collection efficiency

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect coin pickups that randomly spawn on the tracks. Each coin pickup adds to the total coin count.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel horizontal tracks contain runners that automatically move from left to right. Coin pickups randomly spawn on the tracks. When runners collide with coins, they collect them and add to the player's total. When runners reach the right edge of the screen, they teleport back to the left side to continue running. New coins spawn at regular intervals on random tracks.

## Movement System
Runners move at a constant speed from left to right on their assigned tracks. When reaching the right edge of the screen, they instantly teleport to the left edge of the same track. Coins remain stationary until collected. Each track is a fixed horizontal line where runners and coins can be positioned.

## Upgrades
- Number of active runners (more runners = more coin collection opportunities)
- Runner speed (faster runners cover more ground and collect coins more quickly)
- Coin value (each collected coin is worth more)
- Coin spawn rate (more coins appear on tracks)
- Multi-track unlock (unlock additional parallel tracks for more runners)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch runners automatically collect coins and make strategic decisions about which upgrades to purchase to optimize their coin collection rate. The movement system is straightforward and easy to understand visually, while the upgrade system provides clear progression paths.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

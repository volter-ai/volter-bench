Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation first:

1. Implementation Plan:
- The game is a coffee shop management simulation where we need to automate upgrades
- From gameData.js, we can see there are 6 main upgrades:
  * BARISTA_COUNT - Hire more baristas
  * BARISTA_SPEED - Make baristas move faster
  * COFFEE_MACHINE - Reduce coffee making time
  * COUNTER_COUNT - Add more service counters
  * COFFEE_PRICE - Increase price per coffee
  * CUSTOMER_ATTRACTION - Reduce time between customers

- For GameAI.js implementation:
  1. Define UPGRADES array with all 6 upgrade types
  2. getMainCurrency() will return game.money
  3. setupExperimentalMode() will:
     - Set infinite money
     - Randomly apply 0-10 upgrades of each type
  4. updateGameStats() will show:
     - Money
     - Number of baristas
     - Coffee price
     - Customer spawn time
     - All upgrade levels
  5. checkCheapestUpgrade() will:
     - Check cost of each upgrade
     - Buy the cheapest one if enough money
  6. performUpgrade() will:
     - Call appropriate game upgrade method
     - Track upgrade level
     - Log the upgrade

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 730732f7-8474-4c50-a33d-d206d1f51d76
```javascript src/GameAI.js

  setupExperimentalMode() {
    // Give infinite money for experimental mode
    this.game.money = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // Randomly upgrade each stat between 0-10 times

      }

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Experimental mode initialized with random upgrades');

  updateGameStats() {

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game stats updated', stats);

  startUpgradeLoop() {

    this.upgradeInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.checkCheapestUpgrade();

    }, 100);
  }

  checkCheapestUpgrade() {
    let cheapestUpgrade = null;
    let lowestCost = Infinity;

    const costs = {
      BARISTA_COUNT: this.game.baristaCountCost,

    for (const upgrade of UPGRADES) {

        break;
      case 'COFFEE_PRICE':
        this.game.upgradeCoffeePrice();
        break;

      default:
        console.error(`${upgradeName} is not a valid upgrade`);
    }

    if (!skipLogging) {
      const upgradeInfo = {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        upgrade: upgradeName,
        cost: cost,
        level: currentLevel
      };

      this.ai.logUpgrade(upgradeInfo);
      this.ai.updateDebugOverlay(`Purchased ${upgradeName} upgrade for ${cost} (Level ${currentLevel})`);
    }
  }
}

const gameAI = new GameAI();
gameAI.init();

if (window.game) {
  window.game.exportAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.exportLogs();
  window.game.clearAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.clearLogs();
}

export default gameAI;
```

This implementation:
1. Defines all 6 upgrades from the game
2. Tracks upgrade levels separately from the game state
3. In experimental mode, randomly applies upgrades and gives infinite money
4. In normal mode, continuously buys the cheapest available upgrade
5. Logs all game stats and upgrades through the AIUtils
6. Updates the debug overlay with current game state
7. Exports logs on completion

The AI will automatically purchase upgrades to optimize the coffee shop's efficiency based on available money, prioritizing the cheapest upgrades first.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"

- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",

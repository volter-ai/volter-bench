Content: Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency stays at 0 for the first 22 seconds
2. At 22 seconds, it increases to 5 and then stays at 5
3. The initial upgrade costs from gameData.js are:
   - Barista Count: 100
   - Barista Speed: 50
   - Coffee Machine: 75
   - Counter Count: 150
   - Coffee Price: 80
   - Customer Attraction: 60

This indicates two issues:
1. Currency generation is too slow - it takes 22 seconds to get the first 5 coins
2. The cheapest upgrade (Barista Speed) costs 50, which is far too expensive compared to the earning rate

The root cause appears to be:
1. The barista movement speed (100 pixels/sec) is too slow given the distance they need to travel
2. The initial upgrade costs are too high relative to the earning rate

Here's my plan to fix these issues:
1. Increase initial barista speed from 100 to 200 in INITIAL_VALUES
2. Reduce all initial upgrade costs by 80% to make them more attainable early game

Let me write out the changes:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 200, // pixels per second
  COFFEE_MACHINE_TIME: 3, // seconds to make coffee
  COUNTER_COUNT: 1,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 5,
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME: 5, // seconds between customers
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 20,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 10,
  COFFEE_MACHINE: 15,
  COUNTER_COUNT: 30,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 16,
  CUSTOMER_ATTRACTION: 12,
};

export const STATION_POSITIONS = {
  COUNTER_START_X: 100,
  COUNTER_Y: 500,
  COUNTER_SPACING: 150,
  MACHINE_START_X: 100,
  MACHINE_Y: 200,
  MACHINE_SPACING: 150,
};
```

This change should:
1. Make baristas serve customers faster by doubling their movement speed
2. Make upgrades attainable within the first few customer servings
3. Maintain the relative cost ratios between upgrades while making them more accessible

All other files remain unchanged as they reference these values but don't need modification themselves. The game logic will automatically use the new values.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

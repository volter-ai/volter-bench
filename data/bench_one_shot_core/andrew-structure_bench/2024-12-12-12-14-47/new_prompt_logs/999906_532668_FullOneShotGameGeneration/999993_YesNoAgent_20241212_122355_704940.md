Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency starts at 0 and stays at 0 for about 14 seconds
2. At 14 seconds, it increases to 5 (one coffee served)
3. At 21 seconds, it increases to 10 (second coffee served)
4. Player buys BARISTA_SPEED upgrade for 10
5. Currency returns to 0 and stays at 0

The game is functioning somewhat - baristas are serving customers and earning money, but it's very slow. It takes 14 seconds to serve the first customer and another 7 seconds for the second customer. This indicates the baristas are moving too slowly or taking too long at each step.

Looking at the initial values:
- BARISTA_SPEED: 200 pixels/second
- COFFEE_MACHINE_TIME: 3 seconds
- CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME: 5 seconds

The main issue is that the BARISTA_SPEED is too low for the layout. With stations spaced 150 pixels apart and multiple trips needed (counter->machine->counter), it takes too long to complete one order.

Let's fix this by:
1. Increasing initial BARISTA_SPEED to 400 pixels/second
2. Reducing initial COFFEE_MACHINE_TIME to 2 seconds
3. Reducing some upgrade costs to make early game progression faster

Here's the implementation:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 400, // Increased from 200
  COFFEE_MACHINE_TIME: 2, // Reduced from 3
  COUNTER_COUNT: 1,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 5,
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME: 5, // seconds between customers
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 15, // Reduced from 20
  BARISTA_SPEED: 8,  // Reduced from 10
  COFFEE_MACHINE: 12, // Reduced from 15
  COUNTER_COUNT: 25, // Reduced from 30
  COFFEE_PRICE: 12, // Reduced from 16
  CUSTOMER_ATTRACTION: 10, // Reduced from 12
};

export const STATION_POSITIONS = {
  COUNTER_START_X: 100,
  COUNTER_Y: 500,
  COUNTER_SPACING: 150,
  MACHINE_START_X: 100,
  MACHINE_Y: 200,
  MACHINE_SPACING: 150,
};
```

These changes will:
1. Make baristas move twice as fast initially, reducing travel time between stations
2. Reduce coffee making time by 1 second
3. Make upgrades more affordable early game
4. Allow players to get their first upgrade much sooner

The rest of the code can remain unchanged as the core logic is working correctly - it's just the tuning that needed adjustment.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

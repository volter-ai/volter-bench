Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency starts at 0 and stays at 0 for the first 14 seconds
2. At 14 seconds, currency jumps to 8 (one coffee sale)
3. At 22 seconds, player buys a barista upgrade for 15, reducing currency to 1
4. Currency stays at 1 for the remainder of the logs

The main issue I see is that the currency accumulation is too slow. In 30 seconds, only one coffee was sold (8 currency earned). This makes it very difficult to purchase upgrades. While the player did manage to buy one barista upgrade, the slow rate of currency gain means they won't be able to afford another upgrade for a long time.

Looking at the code, I see a few issues:
1. The customer spawn time is 2 seconds (INITIAL_VALUES.CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME)
2. Coffee prep time is 3 seconds (INITIAL_VALUES.COFFEE_PREP_TIME)
3. Movement speed is relatively slow at 100 pixels/sec

To fix this, I'll:
1. Reduce CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME to 1 second to get more customers flowing
2. Reduce COFFEE_PREP_TIME to 2 seconds
3. Increase BARISTA_SPEED to 150 pixels/sec
4. Slightly reduce some upgrade costs

Here are the changes:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  MACHINE_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 150, // Increased from 100
  MAX_CUSTOMERS: 5,
  COFFEE_QUALITY: 1,
  COFFEE_PREP_TIME: 2, // Reduced from 3
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME: 1, // Reduced from 2
  CUSTOMER_PATIENCE: 20, // seconds
  BASE_COFFEE_PRICE: 8,
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 12,  // Reduced from 15
  MACHINE: 15,  // Reduced from 20
  SPEED: 12,    // Reduced from 15
  SPACE: 20,    // Reduced from 25
  QUALITY: 15,  // Reduced from 20
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 },
  MACHINE_START: { x: 500, y: 100 },
  MACHINE_SPACING: 100,
};
```

These changes will:
1. Get customers into the shop faster
2. Allow baristas to serve them more quickly
3. Make upgrades more affordable early game
4. Keep the core gameplay loop intact while making it more engaging

The faster customer spawn rate combined with faster barista movement and coffee prep time should result in more frequent sales, allowing players to purchase upgrades more regularly and progress through the game at a better pace.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

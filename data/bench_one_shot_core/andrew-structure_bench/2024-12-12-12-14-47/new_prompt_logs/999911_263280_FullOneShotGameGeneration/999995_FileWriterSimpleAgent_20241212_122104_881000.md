Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency stays at 0 for the first 13 seconds
2. Then increases to 5 at 14 seconds
3. Stays at 5 for about 9 seconds
4. Increases to 10 at 23 seconds
5. Stays at 10 until the end

The currency is changing, but very slowly. According to the design doc, each coffee sale should generate $5 base amount. The cheapest upgrade (Additional Baristas) costs $100. At the current rate of earning $5 every ~9-10 seconds, it would take about 3-4 minutes to earn enough for the first upgrade.

This falls under issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The player cannot afford any upgrades within the first 30 seconds of gameplay, making the early game too slow and potentially frustrating.

Plan to fix:
1. Reduce the base costs of all upgrades in gameData.js to make them more attainable early game
2. Keep the same doubling mechanic for subsequent purchases
3. Suggested changes:
   - Barista: $100 -> $25
   - Machine: $200 -> $50 
   - Speed: $150 -> $40
   - Space: $300 -> $75
   - Quality: $250 -> $60

This will allow players to get their first upgrade within about 5-10 seconds of gameplay, making the game more engaging early on.

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: a824f5b0-bd46-4581-b62d-f156c4a48de4
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  MACHINE_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  MAX_CUSTOMERS: 5,
  COFFEE_QUALITY: 1,
  COFFEE_PREP_TIME: 3, // seconds
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME: 2, // seconds
  CUSTOMER_PATIENCE: 20, // seconds
  BASE_COFFEE_PRICE: 5,
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 25,
  MACHINE: 50,
  SPEED: 40,
  SPACE: 75,
  QUALITY: 60,
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 },
  MACHINE_START: { x: 500, y: 100 }, // First machine position
  MACHINE_SPACING: 100, // Horizontal space between machines
};
```

This change only requires modifying the UPGRADE_COSTS constants in gameData.js. No other files need to be changed because:
1. The upgrade cost doubling logic is already implemented in the GameLogic class
2. The UI automatically uses these values through the game.upgradeCosts references
3. All other game mechanics (movement, customer spawning, coffee preparation) remain unchanged

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

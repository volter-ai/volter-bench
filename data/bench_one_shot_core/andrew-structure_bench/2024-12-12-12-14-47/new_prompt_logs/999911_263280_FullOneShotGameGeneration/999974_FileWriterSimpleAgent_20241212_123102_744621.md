Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_7" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. The lore will set the scene for the game, the instructions will guide players on the mechanics, and the strategies will provide tips on how to optimize gameplay.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to the plan:

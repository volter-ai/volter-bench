Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency starts at 0 for the first 13 seconds
2. At 14 seconds, it increases to 5
3. At 23 seconds, it increases to 10
4. No further increases happen

The currency is increasing, but very slowly. Looking at the upgrade costs in gameData.js:
- Barista: $15
- Machine: $20  
- Speed: $15
- Space: $25
- Quality: $20

The player earns only $10 in 30 seconds, which means they cannot afford even the cheapest upgrade ($15). This falls under issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive".

The solution is to adjust the game economy by:
1. Increasing the base coffee price (INITIAL_VALUES.BASE_COFFEE_PRICE) from $5 to $8
2. This will allow players to earn $16 from their first two sales instead of $10
3. This means they can afford the cheapest upgrades (Barista or Speed at $15) within the first 20-25 seconds

Here's the implementation plan:
1. Modify src/game/gameData.js to increase BASE_COFFEE_PRICE from 5 to 8
2. No other changes needed as this is a simple economic adjustment

Here are the files:

# Excerpt ID: 1cd9b7af-1f6b-4e5f-a881-f374c466e231
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  MACHINE_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  MAX_CUSTOMERS: 5,
  COFFEE_QUALITY: 1,
  COFFEE_PREP_TIME: 3, // seconds
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME: 2, // seconds
  CUSTOMER_PATIENCE: 20, // seconds
  BASE_COFFEE_PRICE: 8, // Changed from 5 to 8
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 15,  // Reduced from 25
  MACHINE: 20,  // Reduced from 50
  SPEED: 15,    // Reduced from 40
  SPACE: 25,    // Reduced from 75
  QUALITY: 20,  // Reduced from 60
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 },
  MACHINE_START: { x: 500, y: 100 }, // First machine position
  MACHINE_SPACING: 100, // Horizontal space between machines
};
```

This change will allow players to reach their first upgrade faster while maintaining the overall game balance. The first two sales will now generate $16 instead of $10, allowing players to purchase their first upgrade (either a barista or speed upgrade at $15) within the first 20-25 seconds of gameplay.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

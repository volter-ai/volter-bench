Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement an auto-playing infinite runner game.

Design Plan:
- The game will feature runners automatically running on tracks
- Runners collect coins as they run
- Multiple parallel tracks where runners can run simultaneously
- Runners automatically move right to left
- When a runner reaches the left edge, they teleport back to the right
- Coins randomly spawn on tracks
- Currency (coins) accumulates when runners collect coins
- Simple upgrades that increase coin collection efficiency

Here's the filled out design document:

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect coin pickups that randomly spawn on the tracks. Each coin pickup adds to the total coin count.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel horizontal tracks contain runners that automatically move from right to left. Coin pickups randomly spawn on the tracks. When runners collide with coins, they collect them and add to the player's total. When runners reach the left edge, they teleport back to the right side to continue running. New coins spawn at regular intervals.

## Movement System
Runners move at a constant speed from right to left along their assigned tracks. When reaching the left edge, runners instantly teleport to the right edge of their track. Coins remain stationary until collected. No complex animations, just simple position updates.

## Upgrades
- Number of active runners (more runners = more coin collection opportunities)
- Runner speed (faster runners cover more ground and collect more coins)
- Coin value (each collected coin is worth more)
- Coin spawn rate (more coins appear on tracks)
- Multi-track unlock (enables additional parallel tracks for more runners)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch runners automatically collect coins and make strategic decisions about which upgrades to purchase to optimize their coin collection rate. The movement system is straightforward and the game requires no player input beyond purchasing upgrades.

The core gameplay loop is clear: runners collect coins → coins enable upgrades → upgrades increase coin collection rate → more coins collected. This creates the typical exponential growth curve expected in idle/incremental games.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

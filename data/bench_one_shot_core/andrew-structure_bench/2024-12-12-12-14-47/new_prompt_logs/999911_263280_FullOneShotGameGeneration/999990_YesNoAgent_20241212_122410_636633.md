Content: Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency starts at 0 for the first 13 seconds
2. At 14 seconds, it increases to 5
3. At 23 seconds, it increases to 10
4. No further increases happen

The currency is increasing, but very slowly. Looking at the upgrade costs in gameData.js:
- Barista: $15
- Machine: $20  
- Speed: $15
- Space: $25
- Quality: $20

The player earns only $10 in 30 seconds, which means they cannot afford even the cheapest upgrade ($15). This falls under issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive".

The solution is to adjust the game economy by:
1. Increasing the base coffee price (INITIAL_VALUES.BASE_COFFEE_PRICE) from $5 to $8
2. This will allow players to earn $16 from their first two sales instead of $10
3. This means they can afford the cheapest upgrades (Barista or Speed at $15) within the first 20-25 seconds

Here's the implementation plan:
1. Modify src/game/gameData.js to increase BASE_COFFEE_PRICE from 5 to 8
2. No other changes needed as this is a simple economic adjustment

Here are the files:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  MACHINE_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  MAX_CUSTOMERS: 5,
  COFFEE_QUALITY: 1,
  COFFEE_PREP_TIME: 3, // seconds
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_TIME: 2, // seconds
  CUSTOMER_PATIENCE: 20, // seconds
  BASE_COFFEE_PRICE: 8, // Changed from 5 to 8
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 15,  // Reduced from 25
  MACHINE: 20,  // Reduced from 50
  SPEED: 15,    // Reduced from 40
  SPACE: 25,    // Reduced from 75
  QUALITY: 20,  // Reduced from 60
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 },
  MACHINE_START: { x: 500, y: 100 }, // First machine position
  MACHINE_SPACING: 100, // Horizontal space between machines
};
```

This change will allow players to reach their first upgrade faster while maintaining the overall game balance. The first two sales will now generate $16 instead of $10, allowing players to purchase their first upgrade (either a barista or speed upgrade at $15) within the first 20-25 seconds of gameplay.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when customers purchase coffee. Each coffee sale generates a base amount of $5. Customers automatically appear, order coffee, receive their drink from baristas, pay, and leave.

## Core Game
The game takes place in an automated coffee shop. Customers regularly appear at the entrance and line up at the counter. Baristas work between the counter and coffee machines, preparing drinks for customers. When a barista serves a completed drink to a customer, money is earned.

New customers appear at a steady rate as long as there is space in the shop. Each coffee machine can only be used by one barista at a time. Customers leave after being served or if they wait too long.

The shop displays:
- Current money
- Number of customers waiting
- Number of drinks being prepared
- Number of available coffee machines

## Movement System
Entities move in straight lines between fixed points:

Customers:
- Move from entrance to counter
- Wait at counter
- Move from counter to exit after being served

Baristas:
- Move from counter to coffee machine
- Wait at machine while preparing coffee
- Move back to counter to serve customer

## Upgrades
- Additional Baristas ($100 base) - More workers to make coffee
- Additional Coffee Machines ($200 base) - More stations to prepare drinks
- Faster Baristas ($150 base) - Reduces coffee preparation time
- Larger Shop Space ($300 base) - Allows more customers to wait in line
- Better Coffee Quality ($250 base) - Increases money earned per sale

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_7" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. The lore will set the scene for the game, the instructions will guide players on the mechanics, and the strategies will provide tips on how to optimize gameplay.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to the plan:

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a tank battle idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated tanks battle enemy tanks to earn credits
- Primary currency: Credits earned by destroying enemy tanks
- Core gameplay: Player's tanks automatically seek and destroy enemy tanks that spawn randomly
- Movement: Simple straight-line movement between points
- Upgrades: Focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits when their tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically patrol a battlefield. Enemy tanks spawn randomly at the edges of the screen. When a friendly tank detects an enemy tank, it moves toward it and fires. Each successful hit damages the enemy tank. When an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

The game displays the current credit count prominently at the top of the screen. Enemy tanks have visible health bars above them.

## Movement System
Tanks move in straight lines toward their targets. When no enemies are present, friendly tanks move in a simple patrol pattern between random points on their half of the screen. Enemy tanks move in straight lines toward the nearest friendly tank.

Tanks rotate instantly to face their target direction - no turning animations needed. This keeps the movement system clear and functional.

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Add additional friendly tanks to the battlefield
- Tank Speed: Increase movement speed of friendly tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase damage dealt per shot
- Tank Health: Increase durability of friendly tanks
- Fire Rate: Reduce time between shots
- Detection Range: Increase the range at which friendly tanks can spot enemies
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. All action is automated
2. Credits (primary currency) accumulate through tank battles
3. Clear upgrade paths exist to increase credit gain rate
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The genre requirements are maintained exactly as specified

The design focuses on clarity and simplicity while providing multiple avenues for progression through the upgrade system.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

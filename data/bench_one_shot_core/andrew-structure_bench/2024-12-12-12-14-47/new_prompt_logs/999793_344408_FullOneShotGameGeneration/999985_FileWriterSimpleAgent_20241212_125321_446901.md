Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "pong_6" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the essence of the game, explain the core mechanics, and highlight how players can earn and increase currency. The description should be enticing enough to grab the reader's attention.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation. The page body should provide a comprehensive understanding of the game mechanics and upgrades.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

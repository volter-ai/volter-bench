Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a tank battle idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated tanks battle enemy tanks to earn credits
- Primary currency: Credits earned by destroying enemy tanks
- Core gameplay: Player's tanks automatically seek and destroy enemy tanks that spawn randomly
- Movement: Simple straight-line movement between points
- Upgrades: Focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits when their tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically patrol a battlefield. Enemy tanks spawn randomly at the edges of the screen. When a friendly tank detects an enemy tank, it moves toward it and fires. Each successful hit damages the enemy tank. When an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

The game displays the current credit count prominently at the top of the screen. Enemy tanks have visible health bars above them.

## Movement System
Tanks move in straight lines toward their targets. When no enemies are present, friendly tanks move in a simple patrol pattern between random points on their half of the screen. Enemy tanks move in straight lines toward the nearest friendly tank.

Tanks rotate instantly to face their target direction - no turning animations needed. This keeps the movement system clear and functional.

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Add additional friendly tanks to the battlefield
- Tank Speed: Increase movement speed of friendly tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase damage dealt per shot
- Tank Health: Increase durability of friendly tanks
- Fire Rate: Reduce time between shots
- Detection Range: Increase the range at which friendly tanks can spot enemies
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. All action is automated
2. Credits (primary currency) accumulate through tank battles
3. Clear upgrade paths exist to increase credit gain rate
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The genre requirements are maintained exactly as specified

The design focuses on clarity and simplicity while providing multiple avenues for progression through the upgrade system.

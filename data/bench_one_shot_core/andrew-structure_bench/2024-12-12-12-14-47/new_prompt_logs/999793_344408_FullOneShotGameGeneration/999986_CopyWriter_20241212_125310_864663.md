Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: pong_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever either paddle successfully hits the ball. Points are the primary currency.
Each successful hit adds to the point total.
Consecutive hits without missing increase the point multiplier temporarily.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong against each other.
The ball bounces between the paddles, gradually increasing in speed.
When a paddle misses the ball, the game resets with base speed.
The goal is to accumulate points through successful paddle hits.
A score multiplier increases with consecutive hits.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down automatically to track the ball's vertical position
- Ball moves in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When ball hits a paddle, it reflects at a slight random angle
- Ball speed increases gradually until a paddle misses
- After a miss, ball resets to center with base speed

## Upgrades
1. Paddle Height: Increases the size of both paddles
2. Paddle Speed: Makes paddles move faster to track the ball
3. Point Multiplier: Increases base points earned per hit
4. Starting Ball Speed: Increases the initial speed of the ball
5. Paddle Prediction: Improves AI paddle accuracy
6. Combo Multiplier: Increases points earned from consecutive hits

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "pong_6" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the essence of the game, explain the core mechanics, and highlight how players can earn and increase currency. The description should be enticing enough to grab the reader's attention.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation. The page body should provide a comprehensive understanding of the game mechanics and upgrades.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

```json volter.json

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a tank battle idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated tanks battle enemy tanks to earn credits
- Primary currency: Credits earned by destroying enemy tanks
- Core gameplay: Player's tanks automatically seek and destroy enemy tanks that spawn randomly
- Movement: Simple direct line movement between points
- Upgrades: Focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits when their tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks and enemy tanks exist on a 2D battlefield. Enemy tanks spawn randomly at the edges of the screen. Friendly tanks automatically target and shoot at the nearest enemy tank. When an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

Each tank has a health bar displayed above it. When a tank's health reaches zero, it is destroyed.

## Movement System
- Friendly tanks move directly toward their target enemy tank
- Enemy tanks move in straight lines toward the center of the screen
- When tanks are in range of their target, they stop moving and start shooting
- Tanks rotate to face their target
- All movement is at constant speed without acceleration

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Add additional friendly tanks
- Tank Speed: Increase movement speed of friendly tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase damage per shot
- Tank Health: Increase health points of friendly tanks
- Fire Rate: Decrease time between shots
- Range: Increase shooting distance
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. The action is completely automated
2. Credits (primary currency) increase through tank battles
3. Multiple upgrade paths allow for different strategies
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The game loop is clear and continuous

The design follows all guidelines by:
1. Requiring no player input for the core gameplay
2. Having a single currency (credits) that increases through frequent actions
3. Including upgrades that directly increase credit earning rate
4. Using simple, direct movement patterns
5. Maintaining the original genre section

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

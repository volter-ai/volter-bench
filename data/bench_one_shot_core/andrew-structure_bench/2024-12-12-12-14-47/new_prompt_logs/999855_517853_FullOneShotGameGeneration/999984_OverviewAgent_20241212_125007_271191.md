Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a tank battle idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated tanks battle enemy tanks to earn credits
- Primary currency: Credits earned by destroying enemy tanks
- Core gameplay: Player's tanks automatically seek and destroy enemy tanks that spawn randomly
- Movement: Simple direct line movement between points
- Upgrades: Focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits when their tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks and enemy tanks exist on a 2D battlefield. Enemy tanks spawn randomly at the edges of the screen. Friendly tanks automatically target and shoot at the nearest enemy tank. When an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

Each tank has a health bar displayed above it. When a tank's health reaches zero, it is destroyed.

## Movement System
- Friendly tanks move directly toward their target enemy tank
- Enemy tanks move in straight lines toward the center of the screen
- When tanks are in range of their target, they stop moving and start shooting
- Tanks rotate to face their target
- All movement is at constant speed without acceleration

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Add additional friendly tanks
- Tank Speed: Increase movement speed of friendly tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase damage per shot
- Tank Health: Increase health points of friendly tanks
- Fire Rate: Decrease time between shots
- Range: Increase shooting distance
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. The action is completely automated
2. Credits (primary currency) increase through tank battles
3. Multiple upgrade paths allow for different strategies
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The game loop is clear and continuous

The design follows all guidelines by:
1. Requiring no player input for the core gameplay
2. Having a single currency (credits) that increases through frequent actions
3. Including upgrades that directly increase credit earning rate
4. Using simple, direct movement patterns
5. Maintaining the original genre section

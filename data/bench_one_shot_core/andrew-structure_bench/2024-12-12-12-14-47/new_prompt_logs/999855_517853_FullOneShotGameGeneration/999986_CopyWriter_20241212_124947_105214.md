Here is the description of the game game
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when their automated runners collect coins on the track. Coins randomly spawn on the track and are collected when a runner touches them.

## Core Game
Multiple automated runners move across a horizontal track from left to right. Coins randomly spawn on the track at different positions. When runners reach the right edge of the track, they teleport back to the left side and continue running. Each coin collected adds to the player's total currency.

## Movement System
Runners move in a straight line from left to right at a constant speed. When reaching the right edge of the track, runners instantly teleport back to the starting position on the left. Coins remain stationary until collected.

## Upgrades
- Number of Runners: Add additional runners on the track
- Runner Speed: Increase movement speed of all runners
- Coin Value: Multiply the value of each collected coin
- Coin Spawn Rate: Increase frequency of coin spawns
- Track Width: Expand the track to allow more coins to exist simultaneously

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_1" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging description of the game. It should include a hook to grab the reader's attention, followed by a brief explanation of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. It will provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game mechanics, the purpose of the game, and tips on how to progress efficiently.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_1",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_1"
  },
  "description": "Embark on an endless journey with 'infinite_runner_1', where automated runners tirelessly collect coins for you. Watch as your currency grows over time and strategically invest in upgrades to boost your earnings. Add more runners, increase their speed, enhance coin value, and expand the track to maximize your wealth!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_1\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where time never stops, your runners are on an endless mission to collect as many coins as possible. These tireless runners traverse a never-ending track, gathering wealth for you as they go. Your role is to guide their progress through strategic upgrades.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Automated Runners**: Your runners move automatically from left to right, collecting coins that appear on the track.\n- **Currency Accumulation**: Coins are collected when a runner touches them, adding to your total currency.\n- **Teleportation**: Once a runner reaches the end of the track, they teleport back to the start to continue their journey.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Number of Runners**: Increase the number of runners to collect more coins simultaneously.\n- **Runner Speed**: Boost the speed of your runners to cover more ground quickly.\n- **Coin Value**: Enhance the value of each coin collected to increase your earnings.\n- **Coin Spawn Rate**: Increase how often coins appear on the track.\n- **Track Width**: Expand the track to allow more coins to be collected at once.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on increasing the number of runners and their speed early on to maximize coin collection.\n- Balance your upgrades to ensure a steady increase in currency accumulation.\n- Prioritize coin value and spawn rate upgrades as your currency grows to exponentially increase your earnings.\n\nEnjoy the endless adventure and watch your wealth grow in 'infinite_runner_1'!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting the core mechanics and the player's objective. The `page_body` field offers a detailed explanation, including the game's lore, instructions on how to play, available upgrades, and strategies to succeed. This comprehensive approach ensures that players have all the information they need to enjoy and progress in the game.

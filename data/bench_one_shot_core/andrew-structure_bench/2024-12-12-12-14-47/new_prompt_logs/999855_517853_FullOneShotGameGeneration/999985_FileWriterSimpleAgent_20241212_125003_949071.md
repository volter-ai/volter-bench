Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_1" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging description of the game. It should include a hook to grab the reader's attention, followed by a brief explanation of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. It will provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game mechanics, the purpose of the game, and tips on how to progress efficiently.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

# Excerpt ID: 630211a7-28cf-409b-809d-3af81d6f3c5d
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_1",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_1"
  },
  "description": "Embark on an endless journey with 'infinite_runner_1', where automated runners tirelessly collect coins for you. Watch as your currency grows over time and strategically invest in upgrades to boost your earnings. Add more runners, increase their speed, enhance coin value, and expand the track to maximize your wealth!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_1\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where time never stops, your runners are on an endless mission to collect as many coins as possible. These tireless runners traverse a never-ending track, gathering wealth for you as they go. Your role is to guide their progress through strategic upgrades.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Automated Runners**: Your runners move automatically from left to right, collecting coins that appear on the track.\n- **Currency Accumulation**: Coins are collected when a runner touches them, adding to your total currency.\n- **Teleportation**: Once a runner reaches the end of the track, they teleport back to the start to continue their journey.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Number of Runners**: Increase the number of runners to collect more coins simultaneously.\n- **Runner Speed**: Boost the speed of your runners to cover more ground quickly.\n- **Coin Value**: Enhance the value of each coin collected to increase your earnings.\n- **Coin Spawn Rate**: Increase how often coins appear on the track.\n- **Track Width**: Expand the track to allow more coins to be collected at once.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on increasing the number of runners and their speed early on to maximize coin collection.\n- Balance your upgrades to ensure a steady increase in currency accumulation.\n- Prioritize coin value and spawn rate upgrades as your currency grows to exponentially increase your earnings.\n\nEnjoy the endless adventure and watch your wealth grow in 'infinite_runner_1'!"
}
```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting the core mechanics and the player's objective. The `page_body` field offers a detailed explanation, including the game's lore, instructions on how to play, available upgrades, and strategies to succeed. This comprehensive approach ensures that players have all the information they need to enjoy and progress in the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

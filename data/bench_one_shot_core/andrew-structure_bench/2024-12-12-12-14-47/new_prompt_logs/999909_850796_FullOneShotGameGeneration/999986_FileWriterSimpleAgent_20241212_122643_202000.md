Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for `coffee_tycoon_1`, I will focus on filling out the `description` and `page_body` fields in the `volter.json` file. The goal is to provide a concise and engaging description for potential players and a detailed game page body that includes lore, instructions, and strategies.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Description Field**: 
   - This field requires a short, attention-grabbing sentence followed by a brief description of the game mechanics. 
   - I will highlight the core gameplay loop, how players earn currency, and the role of upgrades in increasing currency rates.

2. **Page Body Field**:
   - This field will be more detailed and written in markdown format.
   - I will include a brief lore or theme of the game to set the stage.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to play the game, including how customers and baristas interact.
   - Explain the currency system and how players can use upgrades to enhance their coffee shop.
   - Offer strategies or tips for players to optimize their gameplay and maximize their earnings.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to this plan.

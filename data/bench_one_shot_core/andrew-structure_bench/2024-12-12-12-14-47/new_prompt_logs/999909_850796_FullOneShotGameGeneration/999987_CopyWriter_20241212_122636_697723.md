# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when customers receive their coffee and pay before leaving the shop. Each coffee sale generates a base amount of $5.

## Core Game
Customers automatically spawn at the shop entrance. Baristas work at coffee machines to prepare drinks. When a drink is ready, baristas carry it to waiting customers. After receiving their coffee, customers pay and exit the shop.

The coffee machines show a progress bar while preparing drinks. Customers have a small indicator showing they are waiting for coffee.

New customers appear when there is available space in the shop and existing customers leave.

## Movement System
- Customers move in a straight line from entrance to waiting area
- Baristas move between coffee machines and customers in straight lines
- Customers exit through the entrance after being served
- All movement is instant with no animations, just position updates

## Upgrades
- Additional Baristas ($50 base cost)
- Barista Movement Speed ($30 base cost)
- Coffee Machine Brewing Speed ($40 base cost)
- Maximum Customers in Shop ($60 base cost)
- Coffee Price Multiplier ($100 base cost)

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for `coffee_tycoon_1`, I will focus on filling out the `description` and `page_body` fields in the `volter.json` file. The goal is to provide a concise and engaging description for potential players and a detailed game page body that includes lore, instructions, and strategies.

### Implementation Plan

1. **Description Field**: 
   - This field requires a short, attention-grabbing sentence followed by a brief description of the game mechanics. 
   - I will highlight the core gameplay loop, how players earn currency, and the role of upgrades in increasing currency rates.

2. **Page Body Field**:
   - This field will be more detailed and written in markdown format.
   - I will include a brief lore or theme of the game to set the stage.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to play the game, including how customers and baristas interact.
   - Explain the currency system and how players can use upgrades to enhance their coffee shop.
   - Offer strategies or tips for players to optimize their gameplay and maximize their earnings.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to this plan.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "coffee_tycoon_1",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about coffee_tycoon_1"
  },
  "description": "Step into the world of coffee_tycoon_1, where your coffee shop runs itself! Watch as customers flock in, baristas brew, and money flows. Earn currency by serving coffee and invest in upgrades to boost your profits.",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to Coffee Tycoon 1\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a bustling city where coffee is the lifeblood of its citizens, you own a small but promising coffee shop. Your goal is to become the ultimate coffee tycoon by automating your shop and maximizing profits.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Customers**: They enter your shop automatically and wait for their coffee.

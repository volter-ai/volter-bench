Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: gold_miner_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a simple idle game based on the guidelines.

Planning Phase:
- Theme: Space Mining Operation
- Primary Currency: Space Crystals
- Core Mechanic: Automated space drones collect crystals from asteroids and deliver them to a space station
- Movement: Simple straight-line paths between asteroids and station
- Upgrades: Focus on drone count, speed, and capacity

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: gold_miner_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the central space station. Each deposit adds to the total crystal count based on the drone's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Automated drones fly between randomly spawning asteroids and a central space station. Each asteroid contains a finite amount of Space Crystals, displayed as a progress bar above it. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns at a random location on the screen.

The space station remains fixed in the center of the screen. Multiple drones can mine different asteroids simultaneously. Each drone will select the nearest available asteroid to mine.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between their current position and their target (either asteroid or space station). When a drone reaches an asteroid, it stays there briefly to "mine" before returning to the station. After depositing at the station, it immediately seeks the next closest asteroid.

## Upgrades
1. Drone Count: Add additional drones to collect crystals (starts with 1)
2. Mining Speed: Reduce the time needed to extract crystals from asteroids
3. Cargo Capacity: Increase how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
4. Drone Speed: Increase movement speed of all drones
5. Asteroid Richness: Increase the amount of crystals contained in each asteroid
6. Maximum Asteroids: Increase the number of asteroids that can exist simultaneously
```

This design follows all guidelines:
- Requires no player input except buying upgrades
- Has one primary currency (Space Crystals)
- Features simple straight-line movement
- Includes multiple upgrades that affect currency gain rate
- Maintains the original genre section

The game will be easy to understand visually, with clear feedback through the movement of drones and depleting asteroid progress bars. All systems are fully automated, making it a true idle game.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Error Analysis:
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'path')" occurs in getSprite(). Looking at the code:

# Excerpt ID: ac5a769b-61ac-45a0-bc62-654f0d340385
```javascript
// In gameLogic.js
getSprite(spriteConfig) {
  const texture = PIXI.Texture.from(spriteConfig.path);  // Error here
  const sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);
  sprite.width = spriteConfig.width;
  sprite.height = spriteConfig.height;
  return sprite;
}
```

The issue is that we're not properly defining the SPRITES in assetManifest.js. Looking at the current implementation, we need to ensure all required sprites are defined.

Let's check assetManifest.js:
# Excerpt ID: 012afc18-1f1d-486e-92b6-7cbc74637582
```javascript
export const SPRITES = {
  background: {
    path: 'assets/background.png',
    width: 800,
    height: 600
  },
  asset_name: {  // This is a placeholder and needs to be replaced
    path: 'assets/assetname.png',
    width: 64,
    height: 64
  }
};
```

The issue is that we're trying to use sprites like 'station', 'ship', and 'asteroid' but they're not defined in the manifest. Let's fix assetManifest.js:

# Excerpt ID: 9425c2bc-f2d1-445c-b74b-5540472ca0f4
```js src/game/assetManifest.js
export const SPRITES = {
  background: {
    path: 'assets/background.png',
    width: 800,
    height: 600
  },
  station: {
    path: 'assets/station.png',
    width: 128,
    height: 128
  },
  ship: {
    path: 'assets/ship.png',
    width: 64,
    height: 64
  },
  asteroid: {
    path: 'assets/asteroid.png',
    width: 64,
    height: 64
  }
};
```

# Excerpt ID: 0fe44877-4dbc-49a7-bb9e-0bb3b9673f35
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  MINING_SHIPS: 1,
  MINING_SPEED: 1,
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 10,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 3,
  CRYSTAL_DENSITY: 50,
  STATION_RADIUS: 200,
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  MINING_SHIPS: 100,
  MINING_SPEED: 50,
  CARGO_CAPACITY: 75,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 150,
  CRYSTAL_DENSITY: 200,
};

export const SHIP_SPEED = 100;
```

The changes:
1. Added proper sprite definitions for all required game objects
2. Removed placeholder asset_name
3. Added SHIP_SPEED to gameData.js
4. Added STATION_RADIUS to INITIAL_VALUES

This should resolve the undefined property error by ensuring all required sprite configurations are properly defined before they're used in the game logic.

The rest of the implementation (Game.js, GameUI.js, and gameLogic.js) remains unchanged as they were correct. The error was specifically in the asset manifest not having all required sprite definitions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

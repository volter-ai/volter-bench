Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement an auto-playing infinite runner game.

Design Plan:
- The game will feature runners automatically running on tracks
- Runners collect coins as they run
- Multiple parallel tracks where runners can run simultaneously
- Runners automatically dodge obstacles by switching tracks
- Currency (coins) accumulates as runners collect them
- Simple left/right movement for track switching, forward movement is automatic
- Upgrades will focus on increasing coin collection and runner effectiveness

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect them from the tracks. Coins appear automatically on the tracks at regular intervals. When a runner touches a coin, it's collected and added to the player's total.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel tracks extend from left to right. AI-controlled runners automatically move forward along these tracks. Coins spawn randomly on the tracks. Obstacles occasionally appear that runners must avoid by switching tracks. Each runner automatically collects coins they touch while running.

When a runner reaches the right edge of the screen, they teleport back to the left side and continue running. New coins and obstacles continuously spawn to maintain the game flow.

## Movement System
- Runners move automatically from left to right at a constant speed
- When encountering an obstacle, runners automatically move one track up or down to avoid it
- When reaching the right edge, runners instantly appear on the left side
- Coins disappear when collected
- Obstacles disappear when they reach the right edge

## Upgrades
- Number of simultaneous runners
- Runner movement speed
- Coin value multiplier
- Coin spawn frequency
- Number of parallel tracks
- Runner collision radius (makes it easier to collect coins)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch their runners automatically collect coins while making strategic upgrade decisions to increase their coin collection rate.

The core gameplay loop is straightforward but satisfying:
1. Runners automatically collect coins
2. Players spend coins on upgrades
3. Upgrades make coin collection more efficient
4. Repeat with increasing returns

The movement system is functional and clear, making it easy to understand what's happening without requiring complex animations or player input.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: Space Crystal Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the central space station. Each deposit adds to the total crystal count based on the drone's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Asteroids containing crystals appear randomly in space. Automated drones fly from the central space station to these asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them. Each asteroid has a visible crystal count that depletes as it's mined. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns elsewhere on the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and target asteroids. They first move to an asteroid, pause briefly to mine, then return to the station to deposit crystals. No complex pathfinding or animations needed - just direct point-to-point movement.

## Upgrades
- Number of Active Drones: Increases total mining operations happening simultaneously
- Drone Speed: Makes drones travel faster between locations
- Drone Cargo Capacity: Increases how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
- Maximum Asteroids: Increases how many asteroids can exist simultaneously
- Asteroid Crystal Capacity: Increases how many crystals each asteroid contains

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "Space Crystal Miner" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed description of the game, including the lore, instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. It will be written in markdown format to allow for structured content presentation.

Now, let's proceed to write the content for the `volter.json` file.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "gold_miner_3",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about gold_miner_3"
  },
  "description": "Embark on an interstellar adventure in Space Crystal Miner! Watch as your automated drones mine precious crystals from asteroids and return them to your space station. Earn Space Crystals over time and strategically invest in upgrades to boost your mining efficiency. Increase your fleet, speed, and capacity to maximize your crystal collection!",
  "page_body": "# Space Crystal Miner\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, hidden among the stars, lie asteroids rich with valuable Space Crystals. As the commander of a futuristic mining operation, your mission is to harvest these crystals using a fleet of automated drones. The more crystals you collect, the more you can expand and enhance your mining capabilities.\n\n## How to Play\nSpace Crystal Miner is an idle/incremental game where your primary task is to manage and upgrade your mining operation. Drones automatically seek out and mine asteroids, returning with their cargo to the central space station. Your role is to oversee the operation and make strategic decisions to optimize your crystal collection.\n\n### Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their mined crystals at the space station. The amount depends on the drone's carrying capacity.\n\n### Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Drones**: Increase the number of drones mining simultaneously.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the speed at which drones travel between asteroids and the station.\n- **Drone Cargo Capacity**: Enhance the amount of crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to appear at once, increasing mining opportunities.\n- **Asteroid Crystal Capacity**: Increase the number of crystals each asteroid contains.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Your Upgrades**: Focus on a balanced approach to upgrading your drones and asteroid capacity to ensure a steady flow of crystals.\n- **Prioritize Speed and Capacity**: Early investments in speed and cargo capacity can significantly boost your crystal collection rate.\n- **Expand Your Fleet**: Increasing the number of active drones can exponentially grow your mining operation's efficiency.\n\nEmbark on this cosmic journey and become the ultimate Space Crystal Miner!"

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a succinct overview of the game, highlighting the core mechanics and the player's objectives. The `page_body` field offers a comprehensive guide to the game, including the lore, gameplay instructions, and strategies to help players succeed. This approach ensures that potential players have a clear understanding of what the game entails and how to engage with it effectively.

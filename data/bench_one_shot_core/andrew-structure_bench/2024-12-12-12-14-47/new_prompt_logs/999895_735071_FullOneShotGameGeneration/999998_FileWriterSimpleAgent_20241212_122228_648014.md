Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation first:

1. Implementation Plan:
- The game is about collecting crystals using drones that mine asteroids
- There are 5 types of upgrades:
  * DRONE_COUNT: Add more drones
  * DRONE_SPEED: Make drones move faster
  * DRONE_CAPACITY: Increase how much each drone can carry
  * MAX_ASTEROIDS: Increase number of asteroids
  * ASTEROID_CAPACITY: Increase how much each asteroid contains

- For the GameAI implementation:
  1. Import INITIAL_VALUES and UPGRADE_COSTS from gameData
  2. Define UPGRADES array with all 5 upgrade types
  3. getMainCurrency will return game.crystals
  4. updateGameStats will show:
     - Crystal count
     - Drone count and stats
     - Asteroid count and capacity
     - All upgrade costs
  5. checkCheapestUpgrade will:
     - Check cost of each upgrade
     - Buy the cheapest one affordable
  6. performUpgrade will:
     - Call appropriate game upgrade method
     - Track upgrade level
     - Log the upgrade

2. Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: a871635b-2bb9-4ce3-871a-dbecd9c5f83e
```javascript src/GameAI.js
import { AIUtils } from './AIUtils';
import { INITIAL_VALUES, UPGRADE_COSTS } from './game/gameData';

const UPGRADES = [
  'DRONE_COUNT',
  'DRONE_SPEED',
  'DRONE_CAPACITY',
  'MAX_ASTEROIDS',
  'ASTEROID_CAPACITY'
];

export class GameAI {
  constructor() {
    this.ai = new AIUtils();
    this.game = null;
    this.initialized = false;
    // Initialize upgrade levels for all upgrade types
    this.upgradeLevels = UPGRADES.reduce((acc, upgrade) => {
      acc[upgrade] = 0;
      return acc;
    }, {});
  }

  init() {
    if (!window.game || !window.game.ready) {
      setTimeout(() => this.init(), 100);
      return;
    }
    this.game = window.game;

    if (this.initialized) return;
    this.initialized = true;

    window.game.app.ticker.speed = this.ai.defaultGameSpeed;
    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game speed set to ' + this.ai.defaultGameSpeed + 'x');

    if (this.ai.enabled) {
      this.ai.gameStartTime = Date.now();

      if (this.ai.mode === 'experimental') {
        this.setupExperimentalMode();
      }

      this.ai.startLoggingLoop(this.getMainCurrency.bind(this));
      this.startUpgradeLoop();
      this.updateGameStats();

      setTimeout(() => {
        this.ai.stopAI();
        this.ai.exportLogs();
        this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Session ended - logs exported');
      }, this.ai.duration);
    }
  }

  getMainCurrency() {
    return this.game.crystals;
  }

  setupExperimentalMode() {
    // Give infinite currency for experimental mode
    this.game.crystals = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // Randomly upgrade each stat between 0-10 times
    UPGRADES.forEach(upgrade => {
      const times = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11); // 0 to 10
      for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
        this.performUpgrade(upgrade, 0, true);
      }
    });

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Experimental mode initialized with random upgrades');
  }

  updateGameStats() {
    const stats = {
      Crystals: this.game.crystals,
      'Drone Count': this.game.droneCount,
      'Drone Speed': this.game.droneSpeed.toFixed(1),
      'Drone Capacity': this.game.droneCapacity,
      'Max Asteroids': this.game.maxAsteroids,
      'Asteroid Capacity': this.game.asteroidCapacity,
      'Drone Cost': this.game.droneCost,
      'Speed Cost': this.game.speedCost,
      'Capacity Cost': this.game.capacityCost,
      'Asteroid Count Cost': this.game.asteroidCountCost,
      'Asteroid Capacity Cost': this.game.asteroidCapacityCost
    };

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game stats updated', stats);
  }

  startUpgradeLoop() {
    if (!this.ai.enabled || this.ai.mode === 'experimental') return;

    this.upgradeInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.checkCheapestUpgrade();
      this.updateGameStats();
    }, 100);
  }

  checkCheapestUpgrade() {
    let cheapestUpgrade = null;
    let lowestCost = Infinity;

    const costs = {
      DRONE_COUNT: this.game.droneCost,
      DRONE_SPEED: this.game.speedCost,
      DRONE_CAPACITY: this.game.capacityCost,
      MAX_ASTEROIDS: this.game.asteroidCountCost,
      ASTEROID_CAPACITY: this.game.asteroidCapacityCost
    };

    for (const upgrade of UPGRADES) {
      const cost = costs[upgrade];
      if (cost <= this.game.crystals && cost < lowestCost) {
        cheapestUpgrade = upgrade;
        lowestCost = cost;
      }
    }

    if (cheapestUpgrade) {
      this.performUpgrade(cheapestUpgrade, lowestCost);
    }
  }

  performUpgrade(upgradeName, cost, skipLogging = false) {
    // Increment the upgrade level before performing the upgrade
    this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName]++;
    const currentLevel = this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName];

    switch (upgradeName) {
      case 'DRONE_COUNT':
        this.game.upgradeDroneCount();
        break;
      case 'DRONE_SPEED':
        this.game.upgradeDroneSpeed();
        break;
      case 'DRONE_CAPACITY':
        this.game.upgradeDroneCapacity();
        break;
      case 'MAX_ASTEROIDS':
        this.game.upgradeMaxAsteroids();
        break;
      case 'ASTEROID_CAPACITY':
        this.game.upgradeAsteroidCapacity();
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`${upgradeName} is not a valid upgrade`);
    }

    if (!skipLogging) {
      const upgradeInfo = {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        upgrade: upgradeName,
        cost: cost,
        level: currentLevel
      };

      this.ai.logUpgrade(upgradeInfo);
      this.ai.updateDebugOverlay(`Purchased ${upgradeName} upgrade for ${cost} (Level ${currentLevel})`);
    }
  }
}

const gameAI = new GameAI();
gameAI.init();

if (window.game) {
  window.game.exportAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.exportLogs();
  window.game.clearAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.clearLogs();
}

export default gameAI;
```

This implementation:
1. Tracks all game stats and upgrade costs
2. In normal mode, continuously buys the cheapest available upgrade
3. In experimental mode, randomly applies 0-10 upgrades of each type
4. Logs all upgrades and game state
5. Updates the debug overlay with current stats
6. Exports logs at the end of the session

The AI will automatically purchase upgrades to optimize crystal collection based on what it can afford at any given time.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"

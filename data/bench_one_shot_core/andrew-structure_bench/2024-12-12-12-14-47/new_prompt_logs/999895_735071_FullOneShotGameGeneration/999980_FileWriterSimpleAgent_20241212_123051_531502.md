Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "Space Crystal Miner" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed description of the game, including the lore, instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. It will be written in markdown format to allow for structured content presentation.

Now, let's proceed to write the content for the `volter.json` file.

# Excerpt ID: 6a3d70aa-9b97-4e1c-b58a-3265f097e8d3
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "gold_miner_3",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [

    ".babelrc",

  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about gold_miner_3"
  },
  "description": "Embark on an interstellar adventure in Space Crystal Miner! Watch as your automated drones mine precious crystals from asteroids and return them to your space station. Earn Space Crystals over time and strategically invest in upgrades to boost your mining efficiency. Increase your fleet, speed, and capacity to maximize your crystal collection!",
  "page_body": "# Space Crystal Miner\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, hidden among the stars, lie asteroids rich with valuable Space Crystals. As the commander of a futuristic mining operation, your mission is to harvest these crystals using a fleet of automated drones. The more crystals you collect, the more you can expand and enhance your mining capabilities.\n\n## How to Play\nSpace Crystal Miner is an idle/incremental game where your primary task is to manage and upgrade your mining operation. Drones automatically seek out and mine asteroids, returning with their cargo to the central space station. Your role is to oversee the operation and make strategic decisions to optimize your crystal collection.\n\n### Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their mined crystals at the space station. The amount depends on the drone's carrying capacity.\n\n### Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Drones**: Increase the number of drones mining simultaneously.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the speed at which drones travel between asteroids and the station.\n- **Drone Cargo Capacity**: Enhance the amount of crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to appear at once, increasing mining opportunities.\n- **Asteroid Crystal Capacity**: Increase the number of crystals each asteroid contains.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Your Upgrades**: Focus on a balanced approach to upgrading your drones and asteroid capacity to ensure a steady flow of crystals.\n- **Prioritize Speed and Capacity**: Early investments in speed and cargo capacity can significantly boost your crystal collection rate.\n- **Expand Your Fleet**: Increasing the number of active drones can exponentially grow your mining operation's efficiency.\n\nEmbark on this cosmic journey and become the ultimate Space Crystal Miner!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a succinct overview of the game, highlighting the core mechanics and the player's objectives. The `page_body` field offers a comprehensive guide to the game, including the lore, gameplay instructions, and strategies to help players succeed. This approach ensures that potential players have a clear understanding of what the game entails and how to engage with it effectively.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

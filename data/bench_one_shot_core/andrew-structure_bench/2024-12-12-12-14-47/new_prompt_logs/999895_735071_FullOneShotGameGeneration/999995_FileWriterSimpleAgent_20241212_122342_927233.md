Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that currency (crystals) increases in steps of 10:
- 0 crystals from 0-5s
- 10 crystals from 5-10s 
- 20 crystals from 10-15s
- 30 crystals from 15-30s

The currency does increase, so that's working. However, looking at UPGRADE_COSTS.js, the cheapest upgrade (drone speed) costs 50 crystals. After 30 seconds, the player only has 30 crystals, making it impossible to purchase any upgrades in a reasonable timeframe.

This is issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive"

The solution is to lower the initial upgrade costs to make at least one upgrade achievable within 10 seconds. Given the current crystal earning rate (about 10 crystals every 5 seconds), I recommend:

1. Lower DRONE_SPEED cost from 50 to 25 crystals
2. Lower DRONE_CAPACITY cost from 75 to 40 crystals  
3. Lower DRONE_COUNT cost from 100 to 45 crystals
4. Lower MAX_ASTEROIDS cost from 150 to 60 crystals
5. Lower ASTEROID_CAPACITY cost from 125 to 50 crystals

This way:
- Players can get their first upgrade (speed) after ~12-15 seconds
- Other upgrades become available shortly after
- The doubling cost mechanic ensures long-term progression

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 096e8bd1-e967-484e-b5c7-2d50c37fa196
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  DRONE_CAPACITY: 10,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 3,
  ASTEROID_CAPACITY: 50,
  MINING_TIME: 1, // seconds to mine
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 45,
  DRONE_SPEED: 25,
  DRONE_CAPACITY: 40,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 60,
  ASTEROID_CAPACITY: 50,
};
```

All other files remain unchanged as they don't need modification. This change maintains the core game mechanics while making the early game more engaging by allowing players to access upgrades sooner.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

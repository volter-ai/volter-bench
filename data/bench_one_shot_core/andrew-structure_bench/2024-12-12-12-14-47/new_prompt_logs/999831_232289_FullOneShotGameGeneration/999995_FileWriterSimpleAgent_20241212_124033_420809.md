Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the currency progression over 30 seconds:
- Currency starts at 0
- Increases very slowly, reaching only 9 after 30 seconds
- The cheapest upgrade (Ball Speed) costs 10 points
- At this rate, it would take over 33 seconds just to get the first upgrade

This clearly falls into issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The player cannot afford even the cheapest upgrade (10 points) within the first 30 seconds of gameplay. This makes the game feel too slow and unrewarding in the early stages.

The solution is to adjust the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js to make them more attainable early on. We should lower the initial costs so players can get their first upgrade within about 10 seconds.

Looking at the current rate of earning (about 1 point every 3-4 seconds), we should set the cheapest upgrade to around 3-4 points to make it attainable within 10 seconds.

Here's my plan:
1. Modify UPGRADE_COSTS in gameData.js to lower all initial costs
2. Keep the relative pricing between upgrades similar, just scaled down
3. No other files need to be modified since this is just a configuration change

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 2186ae71-8df2-4938-a215-fcf299b878b3
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BALL_SPEED: 200,
  PADDLE_SIZE: 100,
  BALL_COUNT: 1,
  PADDLE_SPEED: 300,
  POINTS_MULTIPLIER: 1
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BALL_SPEED: 3,  // Was 10
  PADDLE_SIZE: 5,  // Was 15
  BALL_COUNT: 15,  // Was 50
  PADDLE_SPEED: 7,  // Was 20
  POINTS_MULTIPLIER: 8  // Was 25
};
```

This change will:
- Make the first upgrade (Ball Speed) attainable in about 9-10 seconds
- Keep the relative pricing between upgrades similar
- Allow players to experience the upgrade mechanics much earlier
- Create a more engaging early game experience
- Still maintain progression as costs double with each purchase

The rest of the game logic remains sound and doesn't need modification. The currency is increasing as expected, and the upgrade mechanics are working - they were just too expensive initially.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

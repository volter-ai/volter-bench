Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: pong_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever either paddle successfully hits the ball. Points are the primary currency.
Additional points are earned based on the current ball speed - faster balls generate more points per hit.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The ball moves between them, gradually speeding up.
When a paddle misses the ball, the game resets to base speed.
The longer the volley continues, the more points are earned per hit due to increased ball speed.
Score/points display at the top of the screen.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down automatically to track the ball's vertical position
- Ball moves in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When ball hits a paddle, it reflects at a slight random angle
- Ball speed increases by a small amount after each successful paddle hit
- All movement is linear with no acceleration or complex physics

## Upgrades
1. Paddle Height: Increases the size of both paddles, making it easier to hit the ball
2. Paddle Speed: Makes paddles move faster to reach the ball
3. Point Multiplier: Increases points earned per successful hit
4. Starting Ball Speed: Increases the base speed when game resets
5. Speed Scaling: Increases how much the ball speeds up after each hit

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "pong_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how the player earns currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation and upgrade efficiency.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "pong_2",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about pong_2"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the mesmerizing world of pong_2, where two AI-controlled paddles engage in an endless volley. Earn points every time a paddle hits the ball, with faster speeds yielding more rewards. Upgrade your paddles and ball speed to maximize your point collection and climb the leaderboard!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to pong_2\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a digital realm where time stands still, two paddles are locked in an eternal dance, bouncing a ball back and forth in a never-ending game of pong. As the overseer of this realm, your task is to enhance their performance and reap the rewards of their ceaseless efforts.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Automatic Gameplay**: Sit back and watch as the AI-controlled paddles keep the ball in play.\n- **Earning Points**: Gain points every time the ball hits a paddle. The faster the ball, the more points you earn.\n- **Game Reset**: If a paddle misses, the game resets to the base speed, but your accumulated points remain.\n\n## Upgrades\nEnhance your game with strategic upgrades:\n1. **Paddle Height**: Increase paddle size for easier hits.\n2. **Paddle Speed**: Boost paddle movement speed to catch the ball more effectively.\n3. **Point Multiplier**: Amplify the points earned per hit.\n4. **Starting Ball Speed**: Begin each game at a higher speed.\n5. **Speed Scaling**: Increase the rate at which the ball speeds up after each hit.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Focus on Point Multiplier**: Early investment in point multipliers can significantly boost your earnings.\n- **Balance Upgrades**: While paddle upgrades help maintain longer volleys, don't neglect speed-related upgrades to maximize point potential.\n- **Adapt to Game Resets**: Use resets as an opportunity to reassess and optimize your upgrade strategy.\n\nEmbark on this idle adventure and see how far you can push the limits of pong_2!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick and engaging overview of the game, while the `page_body` offers a comprehensive guide, including lore, gameplay instructions, upgrade details, and strategic tips. This approach ensures that players have both a quick understanding and a detailed reference to enhance their gaming experience.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a tank battle idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated tanks battle enemy tanks to earn credits
- Primary currency: Credits earned by destroying enemy tanks
- Core gameplay: Player's tanks automatically seek and destroy enemy tanks that spawn randomly
- Movement: Simple direct movement between points, no complex pathfinding
- Upgrades: Focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_4

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn credits when their tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically patrol the game area. Enemy tanks spawn randomly at the edges of the screen. When a friendly tank detects an enemy tank within its range, it will move towards it and fire. Each time an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

The game displays the current credit count prominently at the top of the screen. Enemy tanks have health bars displayed above them.

## Movement System
Tanks move in straight lines towards their targets. When no enemies are in range, friendly tanks move in a simple patrol pattern between random points on their half of the screen. Enemy tanks move in straight lines towards the nearest friendly tank.

## Upgrades
- Number of friendly tanks (more tanks = more firepower)
- Tank movement speed (faster tanks can engage enemies more quickly)
- Tank damage (tanks destroy enemies faster)
- Tank range (tanks can engage enemies from further away)
- Tank armor (tanks survive longer in battle)
- Enemy spawn rate (more enemies = more potential credits)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch their tank force grow and become more effective over time, while the core gameplay loop of destroying enemies and earning credits happens automatically.

The upgrade system provides multiple ways to increase credit earning rate:
- More tanks means more simultaneous engagements
- Faster/stronger tanks means quicker enemy defeats
- Better range means less time spent moving
- More durability means tanks spend less time respawning
- Increased spawn rates means more opportunities for credits

The movement system is intentionally simple to keep the focus on the strategic elements and upgrade decisions rather than complex tactical gameplay.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "pong_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how the player earns currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation and upgrade efficiency.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

# Excerpt ID: f3ff1673-8140-491e-92e9-126a5183002d
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "pong_2",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about pong_2"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the mesmerizing world of pong_2, where two AI-controlled paddles engage in an endless volley. Earn points every time a paddle hits the ball, with faster speeds yielding more rewards. Upgrade your paddles and ball speed to maximize your point collection and climb the leaderboard!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to pong_2\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a digital realm where time stands still, two paddles are locked in an eternal dance, bouncing a ball back and forth in a never-ending game of pong. As the overseer of this realm, your task is to enhance their performance and reap the rewards of their ceaseless efforts.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Automatic Gameplay**: Sit back and watch as the AI-controlled paddles keep the ball in play.\n- **Earning Points**: Gain points every time the ball hits a paddle. The faster the ball, the more points you earn.\n- **Game Reset**: If a paddle misses, the game resets to the base speed, but your accumulated points remain.\n\n## Upgrades\nEnhance your game with strategic upgrades:\n1. **Paddle Height**: Increase paddle size for easier hits.\n2. **Paddle Speed**: Boost paddle movement speed to catch the ball more effectively.\n3. **Point Multiplier**: Amplify the points earned per hit.\n4. **Starting Ball Speed**: Begin each game at a higher speed.\n5. **Speed Scaling**: Increase the rate at which the ball speeds up after each hit.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Focus on Point Multiplier**: Early investment in point multipliers can significantly boost your earnings.\n- **Balance Upgrades**: While paddle upgrades help maintain longer volleys, don't neglect speed-related upgrades to maximize point potential.\n- **Adapt to Game Resets**: Use resets as an opportunity to reassess and optimize your upgrade strategy.\n\nEmbark on this idle adventure and see how far you can push the limits of pong_2!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick and engaging overview of the game, while the `page_body` offers a comprehensive guide, including lore, gameplay instructions, upgrade details, and strategic tips. This approach ensures that players have both a quick understanding and a detailed reference to enhance their gaming experience.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

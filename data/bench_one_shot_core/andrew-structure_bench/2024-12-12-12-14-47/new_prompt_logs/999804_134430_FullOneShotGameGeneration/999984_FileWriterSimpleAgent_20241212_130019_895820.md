Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "pong_7" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief explanation of the gameplay, how the player earns currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation and upgrade efficiency.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

# Excerpt ID: 26ffcc76-31c5-4b5f-9dca-b8be8e1727f8
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "pong_7",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about pong_7"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the endless action of pong_7, an idle incremental game where AI paddles play an infinite game of pong. Earn points every time a ball hits a paddle and use them to purchase upgrades that enhance paddle size, ball speed, and more. Watch as your currency grows exponentially with strategic upgrades!",
  "page_body": "# pong_7 Game Page\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a digital realm where AI reigns supreme, two paddles engage in an eternal game of pong. As the overseer, your role is to enhance their capabilities, ensuring the game continues indefinitely and efficiently.\n\n## How to Play\nIn pong_7, you are not directly controlling the paddles or balls. Instead, you focus on accumulating points and purchasing upgrades. Points are earned every time a ball hits a paddle. The game is fully automated, allowing you to sit back and watch as the action unfolds.\n\n## Currency Accumulation\nPoints are your primary currency. They are automatically earned with each paddle hit. The more balls in play, the faster you can accumulate points.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Paddle Size**: Increase the height of both paddles to make it easier to hit balls.\n- **Ball Speed**: Increase the base speed of all balls, making the game more challenging but rewarding.\n- **Multi-Ball**: Add more balls to the game, increasing the potential for earning points.\n- **Points Per Hit**: Multiply the points earned with each paddle hit, accelerating your currency growth.\n- **Paddle Speed**: Enhance the paddles' movement speed to better intercept fast-moving balls.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on upgrading 'Points Per Hit' early to maximize your point accumulation.\n- Balance between 'Multi-Ball' and 'Paddle Size' to maintain control while increasing point potential.\n- Gradually increase 'Ball Speed' to challenge your paddles and increase the excitement.\n\nEnjoy the endless cycle of pong_7, where strategy and automation combine for a unique gaming experience!"
}
```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting its idle nature and the role of upgrades. The `page_body` field expands on this by providing a narrative context, detailed gameplay instructions, and strategic advice to help players optimize their experience.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

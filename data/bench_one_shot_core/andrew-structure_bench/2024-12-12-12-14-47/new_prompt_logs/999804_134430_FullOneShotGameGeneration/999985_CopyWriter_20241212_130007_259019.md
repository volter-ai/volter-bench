Here is the description of the game game
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball hits either paddle. Points are the primary currency used to purchase upgrades.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically track and move to intercept balls. Multiple balls can be in play simultaneously. Each ball gradually speeds up until a point is scored, then resets to base speed. The game continues indefinitely, generating points with each paddle hit.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down vertically along the left and right edges
- Each paddle automatically moves toward the y-position of the nearest ball
- Balls move in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When a ball scores (passes a paddle), it resets to the center with a random direction

## Upgrades
- Paddle Size: Increases height of both paddles
- Ball Speed: Increases base movement speed of all balls
- Multi-Ball: Adds additional balls to the game
- Points Per Hit: Multiplies points earned when balls hit paddles
- Paddle Speed: Increases how quickly paddles can move to catch balls

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "pong_7" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief explanation of the gameplay, how the player earns currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation and upgrade efficiency.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "pong_7",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about pong_7"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the endless action of pong_7, an idle incremental game where AI paddles play an infinite game of pong. Earn points every time a ball hits a paddle and use them to purchase upgrades that enhance paddle size, ball speed, and more. Watch as your currency grows exponentially with strategic upgrades!",
  "page_body": "# pong_7 Game Page\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a digital realm where AI reigns supreme, two paddles engage in an eternal game of pong. As the overseer, your role is to enhance their capabilities, ensuring the game continues indefinitely and efficiently.\n\n## How to Play\nIn pong_7, you are not directly controlling the paddles or balls. Instead, you focus on accumulating points and purchasing upgrades. Points are earned every time a ball hits a paddle. The game is fully automated, allowing you to sit back and watch as the action unfolds.\n\n## Currency Accumulation\nPoints are your primary currency. They are automatically earned with each paddle hit. The more balls in play, the faster you can accumulate points.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Paddle Size**: Increase the height of both paddles to make it easier to hit balls.\n- **Ball Speed**: Increase the base speed of all balls, making the game more challenging but rewarding.\n- **Multi-Ball**: Add more balls to the game, increasing the potential for earning points.\n- **Points Per Hit**: Multiply the points earned with each paddle hit, accelerating your currency growth.\n- **Paddle Speed**: Enhance the paddles' movement speed to better intercept fast-moving balls.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on upgrading 'Points Per Hit' early to maximize your point accumulation.\n- Balance between 'Multi-Ball' and 'Paddle Size' to maintain control while increasing point potential.\n- Gradually increase 'Ball Speed' to challenge your paddles and increase the excitement.\n\nEnjoy the endless cycle of pong_7, where strategy and automation combine for a unique gaming experience!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting its idle nature and the role of upgrades. The `page_body` field expands on this by providing a narrative context, detailed gameplay instructions, and strategic advice to help players optimize their experience.

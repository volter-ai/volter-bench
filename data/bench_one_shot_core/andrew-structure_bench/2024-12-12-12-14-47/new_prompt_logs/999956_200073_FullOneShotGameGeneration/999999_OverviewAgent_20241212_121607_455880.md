Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: gold_miner_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a gold mining idle game.

Planning Phase:
1. Core Mechanics:
- Multiple gold mines appear on the map
- Automated miners move between mines and a central depot
- Miners collect gold from mines and deposit at depot
- Gold is the primary currency
- Mines deplete over time and new ones spawn

2. Movement System:
- Miners move in straight lines between mines and depot
- Simple position updates without complex pathfinding
- Clear visual feedback of mining operations

3. Currency System:
- Gold accumulates when miners deposit at depot
- Rate increases with upgrades

4. Upgrades:
- More miners
- Faster miners
- Larger mining capacity
- More simultaneous mines
- Richer mines

Now, let's write the overview document:

# Overview
Title: gold_miner_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn gold when miners deposit their cargo at the central depot. Each miner automatically travels to mines, collects gold, and returns to deposit it. The amount of gold earned per deposit depends on the miner's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Multiple gold mines appear on the screen, each containing a finite amount of gold. Automated miners travel between the mines and a central depot. When a miner reaches a mine, they collect gold up to their carrying capacity. They then return to the depot to deposit the gold, which adds to the player's currency. When a mine is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns in a random location.

## Movement System
Miners move in straight lines between their current position and their destination (either a mine or the depot). When a miner needs to collect gold, they target the nearest non-empty mine. After collecting, they move directly to the depot. Once they've deposited their gold, they select a new mine and repeat the cycle.

## Upgrades
- Miner Count: Add additional miners to collect gold simultaneously
- Mining Speed: Increase the movement speed of all miners
- Carrying Capacity: Increase how much gold each miner can carry per trip
- Maximum Mines: Increase the number of mines that can exist simultaneously
- Mine Size: Increase the amount of gold in each mine
```

This design follows all guidelines:
1. No player input required for core gameplay
2. Gold is the primary currency that increases through frequent deposits
3. All upgrades directly increase gold acquisition rate
4. Movement is simple and straightforward
5. Genre section remains unchanged

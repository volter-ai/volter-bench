Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a gold mining idle game.

Planning Phase:
1. Core Mechanics:
- Multiple gold mines appear on the map
- Automated miners move between mines and a central depot
- Miners collect gold from mines and deposit at depot
- Gold is the primary currency
- Mines deplete over time and new ones spawn

2. Movement System:
- Miners move in straight lines between mines and depot
- Simple position updates without complex pathfinding
- Clear visual feedback of mining operations

3. Currency System:
- Gold accumulates when miners deposit at depot
- Rate increases with upgrades

4. Upgrades:
- More miners
- Faster miners
- Larger mining capacity
- More simultaneous mines
- Richer mines

Now, let's write the overview document:

# Overview
Title: gold_miner_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn gold when miners deposit their cargo at the central depot. Each miner automatically travels to mines, collects gold, and returns to deposit it. The amount of gold earned per deposit depends on the miner's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Multiple gold mines appear on the screen, each containing a finite amount of gold. Automated miners travel between the mines and a central depot. When a miner reaches a mine, they collect gold up to their carrying capacity. They then return to the depot to deposit the gold, which adds to the player's currency. When a mine is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns in a random location.

## Movement System
Miners move in straight lines between their current position and their destination (either a mine or the depot). When a miner needs to collect gold, they target the nearest non-empty mine. After collecting, they move directly to the depot. Once they've deposited their gold, they select a new mine and repeat the cycle.

## Upgrades
- Miner Count: Add additional miners to collect gold simultaneously
- Mining Speed: Increase the movement speed of all miners
- Carrying Capacity: Increase how much gold each miner can carry per trip
- Maximum Mines: Increase the number of mines that can exist simultaneously
- Mine Size: Increase the amount of gold in each mine
```

This design follows all guidelines:
1. No player input required for core gameplay
2. Gold is the primary currency that increases through frequent deposits
3. All upgrades directly increase gold acquisition rate
4. Movement is simple and straightforward
5. Genre section remains unchanged

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

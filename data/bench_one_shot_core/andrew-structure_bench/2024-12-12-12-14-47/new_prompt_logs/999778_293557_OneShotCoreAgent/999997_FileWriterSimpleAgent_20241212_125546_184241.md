Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Error Analysis:
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'path')" typically occurs when trying to access the 'path' property of an undefined object. In this case, it's happening when trying to load sprites.

Looking at the code:
# Excerpt ID: 95792f1b-19be-4f8d-a3e9-9a1c47640eb2
```js
loadAssets(SPRITES, () => {
  if (!this.app.stage) return;
  this.createGameObjects();
  this.app.ticker.add(this.gameLoop.bind(this));
  this.ready = true;
});
```

The issue is that we're missing the `utils.js` file that contains the `loadAssets` function. This function is referenced but not defined. Let's create the missing utility function.

2. Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 87b45013-8481-47b7-85e8-2c334cf89a6e
```js src/game/utils.js
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';

export const loadAssets = (sprites, onComplete) => {
  // Add all sprite paths to the PIXI loader
  Object.values(sprites).forEach(sprite => {
    PIXI.Assets.add(sprite.path, sprite.path);
  });

  // Load all sprites
  Promise.all(
    Object.values(sprites).map(sprite => 
      PIXI.Assets.load(sprite.path)
    )
  ).then(() => {
    onComplete();
  });
};
```

The rest of the files remain unchanged as they were correct. The error was due to a missing utility file that handles asset loading. This new implementation:

1. Takes a sprites configuration object and a callback function
2. Adds each sprite to PIXI's asset loader
3. Loads all sprites asynchronously
4. Calls the callback function when loading is complete

This should resolve the error and allow the game to properly load and display the sprites.

Note: Make sure the asset files (tank images, background) are actually present in the correct path (public/assets/) in your project directory:
- public/assets/background.png
- public/assets/friendly_tank.png
- public/assets/enemy_tank.png

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

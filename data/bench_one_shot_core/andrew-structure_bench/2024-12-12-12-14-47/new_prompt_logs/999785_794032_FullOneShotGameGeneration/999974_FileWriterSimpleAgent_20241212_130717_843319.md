Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "tank_attack_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. The lore will provide context and background to the game, while the instructions will guide players on the mechanics and objectives. Strategies will offer tips on how to effectively progress in the game.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

This implementation provides a clear and engaging description of the game, along with a comprehensive page body that includes lore, instructions, and strategies to enhance the player's experience.

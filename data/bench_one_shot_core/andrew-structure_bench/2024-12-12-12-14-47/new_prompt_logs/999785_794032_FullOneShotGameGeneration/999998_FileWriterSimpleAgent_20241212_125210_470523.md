Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation first:

1. Implementation Plan:
- The game is a tank vs base battle where tanks automatically move and attack bases
- The main currency is "credits" earned from destroying bases
- There are 5 possible upgrades:
  * Tank Health
  * Tank Damage
  * Tank Speed
  * Tank Count
  * Base Reward
- For the GameAI implementation:
  * Import all upgrade types and costs from gameData
  * Track upgrade levels for each upgrade type
  * In experimental mode:
    - Set credits to max
    - Randomly apply 0-10 upgrades of each type
  * In standard mode:
    - Check costs of all available upgrades
    - Purchase the cheapest one if enough credits
  * Update stats to show:
    - Current credits
    - All tank stats
    - Base reward amount
    - Upgrade levels
  * Log currency and upgrades for analysis

2. Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 3b564e09-2d6d-4c12-ab96-455225860a57
```javascript src/GameAI.js
import { AIUtils } from './AIUtils';
import { UPGRADE_COSTS } from './game/gameData';

const UPGRADES = [
  'TANK_HEALTH',
  'TANK_DAMAGE', 
  'TANK_SPEED',
  'TANK_COUNT',
  'BASE_REWARD'
];

export class GameAI {
  constructor() {
    this.ai = new AIUtils();
    this.game = null;
    this.initialized = false;
    // Initialize upgrade levels for all upgrade types
    this.upgradeLevels = UPGRADES.reduce((acc, upgrade) => {
      acc[upgrade] = 0;
      return acc;
    }, {});
  }

  init() {
    if (!window.game || !window.game.ready) {
      setTimeout(() => this.init(), 100);
      return;
    }
    this.game = window.game;

    if (this.initialized) return;
    this.initialized = true;

    window.game.app.ticker.speed = this.ai.defaultGameSpeed;
    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game speed set to ' + this.ai.defaultGameSpeed + 'x');

    if (this.ai.enabled) {
      this.ai.gameStartTime = Date.now();

      if (this.ai.mode === 'experimental') {
        this.setupExperimentalMode();
      }

      setTimeout(() => {
        this.ai.stopAI();
        this.ai.exportLogs();
        this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Session ended - logs exported');
      }, this.ai.duration);
    }
  }

  getMainCurrency() {
    return this.game.credits;
  }

  setupExperimentalMode() {
    // Give infinite currency for experimental mode
    this.game.credits = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // Randomly upgrade each stat between 0-10 times
    UPGRADES.forEach(upgrade => {
      const times = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11); // 0 to 10
      for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
        this.performUpgrade(upgrade, 0, true);
      }
    });

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Experimental mode initialized with random upgrades');
  }

  updateGameStats() {
    const stats = {
      Credits: Math.floor(this.game.credits),

      'Tank Damage Level': this.upgradeLevels.TANK_DAMAGE,
      'Tank Speed Level': this.upgradeLevels.TANK_SPEED,
      'Tank Count Level': this.upgradeLevels.TANK_COUNT,
      'Base Reward Level': this.upgradeLevels.BASE_REWARD
    };

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game stats updated', stats);
  }

  startUpgradeLoop() {
    if (!this.ai.enabled || this.ai.mode === 'experimental') return;

    this.upgradeInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.checkCheapestUpgrade();
      this.updateGameStats();
    }, 100);
  }

  checkCheapestUpgrade() {
    let cheapestUpgrade = null;
    let lowestCost = Infinity;

    const costs = {
      TANK_HEALTH: this.game.tankHealthCost,
      TANK_DAMAGE: this.game.tankDamageCost,
      TANK_SPEED: this.game.tankSpeedCost,
      TANK_COUNT: this.game.tankCountCost,

    };

    for (const upgrade of UPGRADES) {
      const cost = costs[upgrade];
      if (cost <= this.game.credits && cost < lowestCost) {
        cheapestUpgrade = upgrade;
        lowestCost = cost;
      }
    }

    if (cheapestUpgrade) {
      this.performUpgrade(cheapestUpgrade, lowestCost);
    }
  }

  performUpgrade(upgradeName, cost, skipLogging = false) {
    // Increment the upgrade level before performing the upgrade
    this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName]++;
    const currentLevel = this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName];

    switch (upgradeName) {
      case 'TANK_HEALTH':
        this.game.upgradeTankHealth();
        break;
      case 'TANK_DAMAGE':
        this.game.upgradeTankDamage();
        break;
      case 'TANK_SPEED':
        this.game.upgradeTankSpeed();
        break;
      case 'TANK_COUNT':
        this.game.upgradeTankCount();
        break;
      case 'BASE_REWARD':
        this.game.upgradeBaseReward();
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`${upgradeName} is not a valid upgrade`);
    }

    if (!skipLogging) {
      const upgradeInfo = {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        upgrade: upgradeName,
        cost: cost,
        level: currentLevel
      };

      this.ai.logUpgrade(upgradeInfo);
      this.ai.updateDebugOverlay(`Purchased ${upgradeName} upgrade for ${cost} (Level ${currentLevel})`);
    }
  }
}

const gameAI = new GameAI();
gameAI.init();

if (window.game) {
  window.game.exportAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.exportLogs();
  window.game.clearAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.clearLogs();
}

export default gameAI;
```

This implementation:
1. Defines all possible upgrades
2. Tracks upgrade levels
3. Implements both experimental and standard modes
4. Logs all relevant game stats and upgrades
5. Buys cheapest available upgrade in standard mode
6. Randomly applies upgrades in experimental mode
7. Updates debug overlay with current game state
8. Exports logs for analysis

The AI will automatically play the game by purchasing upgrades whenever possible, focusing on the cheapest available upgrades to maximize resource usage.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

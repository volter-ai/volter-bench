Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs:

1. From 0s to 8s: Currency stays at 0
2. At 8.5s: Player makes upgrades (TANK_HEALTH, TANK_DAMAGE) costing 13 credits total
3. At 9s: Currency is 7
4. More upgrades follow with currency fluctuating
5. Around 18s-28s: Currency stays at 0 for a long period
6. At 28s: Currency jumps to 24
7. Final upgrades and currency changes follow

The game is functional but has some issues:

1. Initial currency gain is slow (takes 8s to get first credits)
2. Long periods without currency gain (18-28s)
3. Currency gain seems inconsistent

The root cause appears to be in the tank-base combat logic. Looking at the code, I notice:

1. Tanks only damage bases when they're within 50 units
2. Tanks and bases damage each other simultaneously
3. Tanks often die before destroying bases due to BASE_DAMAGE being too high relative to TANK_HEALTH

Let's fix this by:
1. Reducing BASE_DAMAGE in INITIAL_VALUES
2. Increasing initial TANK_HEALTH
3. Slightly increasing TANK_DAMAGE

Here are the changes:

# Excerpt ID: 04719212-b984-4ff5-841e-a45427d7ecec
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  TANK_HEALTH: 150,
  TANK_DAMAGE: 50,
  TANK_SPEED: 100,
  TANK_COUNT: 1,
  BASE_REWARD: 20,
  BASE_HEALTH: 100,
  BASE_DAMAGE: 5,
  TANK_SPAWN_TIME: 3,
  BASE_SPAWN_TIME: 5
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  TANK_HEALTH: 5,
  TANK_DAMAGE: 8,
  TANK_SPEED: 10,
  TANK_COUNT: 25,
  BASE_REWARD: 15
};

export const SPAWN_POSITIONS = {
  TANKS: [
    {x: 50, y: 100},
    {x: 50, y: 300},
    {x: 50, y: 500}
  ],
  BASES: [
    {x: 700, y: 150},
    {x: 700, y: 300},
    {x: 700, y: 450}
  ]
};
```

These changes will:
1. Make tanks more durable (150 health vs 100)
2. Make tanks deal more damage (50 vs 40)
3. Reduce base damage (5 vs 10)

This should result in:
1. Faster initial currency gain
2. More consistent currency generation
3. Less periods of zero income
4. Better game balance overall

The rest of the code remains unchanged as the issue was purely with the initial values.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

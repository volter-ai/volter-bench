Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency behavior:
- First 8 seconds: Currency stays at 0
- At 9s: Currency increases to 7
- At 15s: Currency jumps to 27
- Regular currency updates occur, showing earnings

2. Upgrades:
- Multiple upgrades are purchased successfully
- Tank health upgrades are purchased repeatedly
- Tank damage, speed, and count upgrades are also purchased
- The cost doubling mechanic appears to be broken - tank health upgrades remain at cost 20 instead of doubling

The main issue is that the upgrade costs are not properly doubling as specified in the design doc. This is causing the player to be able to purchase an excessive number of tank health upgrades since the cost stays fixed at 20.

Let's fix this in the GameLogic class by properly implementing the cost doubling:

```js src/game/gameLogic.js
import * as PIXI from 'pixi.js';
import { INITIAL_VALUES, UPGRADE_COSTS, SPAWN_POSITIONS } from './gameData';
import { SPRITES } from './assetManifest';
import { loadAssets } from './utils'

const SCREEN_SIZE = {
  width: 800,
  height: 600
}

export class GameLogic {
  constructor(container) {
    this.app = new PIXI.Application({
      width: SCREEN_SIZE.width,
      height: SCREEN_SIZE.height,
      backgroundColor: 0x222C37,
    });

    container.appendChild(this.app.view);

    this.ready = false;
    this.credits = 0;
    this.tankHealth = INITIAL_VALUES.TANK_HEALTH;
    this.tankDamage = INITIAL_VALUES.TANK_DAMAGE;
    this.tankSpeed = INITIAL_VALUES.TANK_SPEED;
    this.tankCount = INITIAL_VALUES.TANK_COUNT;
    this.baseReward = INITIAL_VALUES.BASE_REWARD;
    
    this.tankHealthCost = UPGRADE_COSTS.TANK_HEALTH;
    this.tankDamageCost = UPGRADE_COSTS.TANK_DAMAGE;
    this.tankSpeedCost = UPGRADE_COSTS.TANK_SPEED;
    this.tankCountCost = UPGRADE_COSTS.TANK_COUNT;
    this.baseRewardCost = UPGRADE_COSTS.BASE_REWARD;

    this.tankSpawnTimer = 0;
    this.baseSpawnTimer = 0;

    loadAssets(SPRITES, () => {
      if (!this.app.stage) return;
      this.createGameObjects();
      this.app.ticker.add(this.gameLoop.bind(this));
      this.ready = true;
    });
  }

  getSprite(key) {
    const sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(PIXI.Loader.shared.resources[key].texture);
    sprite.width = SPRITES[key].width;
    sprite.height = SPRITES[key].height;
    return sprite;
  }

  createGameObjects() {
    this.background = this.getSprite('background');
    this.tanks = new PIXI.Container();
    this.bases = new PIXI.Container();
    
    this.app.stage.addChild(this.background);
    this.app.stage.addChild(this.tanks);
    this.app.stage.addChild(this.bases);

    // Create initial tanks and bases
    this.spawnTank();
    SPAWN_POSITIONS.BASES.forEach(pos => this.spawnBase(pos.x, pos.y));
  }

  spawnTank() {
    if (this.tanks.children.length >= this.tankCount) return;
    
    const pos = SPAWN_POSITIONS.TANKS[this.tanks.children.length % SPAWN_POSITIONS.TANKS.length];
    const tank = this.getSprite('tank');
    tank.anchor.set(0.5);
    tank.x = pos.x;
    tank.y = pos.y;
    tank.health = this.tankHealth;
    tank.maxHealth = this.tankHealth;
    this.tanks.addChild(tank);
  }

  spawnBase(x, y) {
    const base = this.getSprite('base');
    base.anchor.set(0.5);
    base.x = x;
    base.y = y;
    base.health = INITIAL_VALUES.BASE_HEALTH;
    base.maxHealth = INITIAL_VALUES.BASE_HEALTH;
    this.bases.addChild(base);
  }

  gameLoop(delta) {
    const elapsedSecs = delta / 60;

    // Spawn timers
    this.tankSpawnTimer += elapsedSecs;
    if (this.tankSpawnTimer >= INITIAL_VALUES.TANK_SPAWN_TIME) {
      this.spawnTank();
      this.tankSpawnTimer = 0;
    }

    this.baseSpawnTimer += elapsedSecs;
    if (this.baseSpawnTimer >= INITIAL_VALUES.BASE_SPAWN_TIME && this.bases.children.length < SPAWN_POSITIONS.BASES.length) {
      const pos = SPAWN_POSITIONS.BASES[this.bases.children.length];
      this.spawnBase(pos.x, pos.y);
      this.baseSpawnTimer = 0;
    }

    // Tank movement and combat
    this.tanks.children.forEach(tank => {
      if (this.bases.children.length === 0) return;

      // Find nearest base
      let nearestBase = this.bases.children[0];
      let nearestDist = this.getDistance(tank, nearestBase);

      this.bases.children.forEach(base => {
        const dist = this.getDistance(tank, base);
        if (dist < nearestDist) {
          nearestDist = dist;
          nearestBase = base;
        }
      });

      // Move toward nearest base
      if (nearestDist > 50) {
        const angle = Math.atan2(nearestBase.y - tank.y, nearestBase.x - tank.x);
        tank.x += Math.cos(angle) * this.tankSpeed * elapsedSecs;
        tank.y += Math.sin(angle) * this.tankSpeed * elapsedSecs;
      } else {
        // Attack base
        nearestBase.health -= this.tankDamage * elapsedSecs;
        tank.health -= INITIAL_VALUES.BASE_DAMAGE * elapsedSecs;

        // Check tank death
        if (tank.health <= 0) {
          this.tanks.removeChild(tank);
        }

        // Check base destruction
        if (nearestBase.health <= 0) {
          this.credits += this.baseReward;
          this.bases.removeChild(nearestBase);
        }
      }
    });
  }

  getDistance(obj1, obj2) {
    const dx = obj1.x - obj2.x;
    const dy = obj1.y - obj2.y;
    return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
  }

  upgradeTankHealth() {
    if (this.credits >= this.tankHealthCost) {
      this.credits -= this.tankHealthCost;
      this.tankHealth *= 1.2;
      this.tankHealthCost *= 2;
    }
  }

  upgradeTankDamage() {
    if (this.credits >= this.tankDamageCost) {
      this.credits -= this.tankDamageCost;
      this.tankDamage *= 1.2;
      this.tankDamageCost *= 2;
    }
  }

  upgradeTankSpeed() {
    if (this.credits >= this.tankSpeedCost) {
      this.credits -= this.tankSpeedCost;
      this.tankSpeed *= 1.2;
      this.tankSpeedCost *= 2;
    }
  }

  upgradeTankCount() {
    if (this.credits >= this.tankCountCost) {
      this.credits -= this.tankCountCost;
      this.tankCount += 1;
      this.tankCountCost *= 2;
      this.spawnTank();
    }
  }

  upgradeBaseReward() {
    if (this.credits >= this.baseRewardCost) {
      this.credits -= this.baseRewardCost;
      this.baseReward *= 1.2;
      this.baseRewardCost *= 2;
    }
  }

  destroy() {
    this.app.destroy(true);
  }
}
```

The changes made:
1. Fixed the upgrade cost doubling by ensuring the cost multiplier is properly applied in each upgrade method
2. No other changes were needed as the core game mechanics appear to be working correctly

The game should now have proper progression with increasing upgrade costs, preventing the player from being able to spam upgrades indefinitely at the same cost.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

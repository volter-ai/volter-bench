Here is the design doc of the game

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits (primary currency) whenever a tank destroys an enemy base. Each destroyed base awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically spawn at the left side of the screen. Enemy bases appear on the right side. Tanks move towards the nearest enemy base and attack it. When a base is destroyed, it respawns after a short delay. Tanks have a health bar and will be destroyed if they take too much damage from base defenses, but will respawn after a delay.

## Movement System
- Tanks spawn at fixed points on the left side of the screen
- Tanks move in straight lines towards the nearest enemy base
- When a tank's target base is destroyed, it selects and moves to the next nearest base
- Destroyed tanks respawn at the original spawn points
- Enemy bases appear at fixed positions on the right side of the screen

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Increase the number of tanks that can exist simultaneously
- Tank Health: Increase the durability of tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase the damage tanks deal to bases
- Tank Speed: Increase how fast tanks move
- Base Reward: Increase the credits earned from destroying bases

Identify the presences of one or more of these issues:
1. Currency never changes: this means that the player is unable to earn currency. This is likely a problem with the game logic
2. No upgrades: this is when the currency does increase but even when the player has enough currency to buy upgrades, the upgrade purchase never happens. This is usually also a problem with the game logic
3. Upgrades too expensive: this is a simple issue where the currency does increase but the player earns currency too slowly they can't afford an upgrade for the entire duration of the run. The solution here is to lower the price of the upgrades so the player can afford at least one within the first 10 seconds

Common causes for the 'Currency never changes' issue:
1. If the game has bullets, the bullet might not be flying in the correct vector in both x and y. The common problem is that the bullet only changes in x or y rather than moving toward the vector of the difference between the starting position and the target.
2. If the game has character movement, make sure the characters are able to move in all the directions that are needed. For instance, resources or enemies might spawn at different y positions and the character would need to be able to move in both x and y and not just x.

If you identify issues, identify the cause. Then fix the issues. If you don't see any issues. Write a brief analysis to `temp/analysis.md`

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will fix the issue. Think carefully about the ramifications of the change and think carefully about whether another piece of code would need to adjusted as a consequence of this change. Think through all the required adjustments and be sure that the full logic still works after your change. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency starts at 0 for first 7 seconds
2. At 8 seconds, currency jumps to 20 (first base destroyed)
3. Player makes several upgrades:
   - Tank Health (5 credits)
   - Tank Damage (8 credits) 
   - Tank Health again (10 credits)
   - Tank Speed (10 credits)
   - Base Reward (15 credits)
   - Tank Damage (16 credits)
   - Tank Health (20 credits)
   - Tank Speed (20 credits)
   - Tank Count (25 credits)
   - Base Reward (30 credits)

4. Currency continues to increase periodically from base destructions
5. Player is able to afford and purchase multiple upgrades

Analysis:
The game appears to be functioning correctly according to the design doc:
1. Currency changes appropriately when bases are destroyed
2. Upgrades are working and can be purchased
3. Upgrade costs are reasonable - player can make first purchase within 8 seconds
4. Upgrade costs double after each purchase as intended
5. Multiple tanks can be spawned and attack bases simultaneously
6. Base rewards increase after upgrading base reward

I'll write this analysis to a file:

Analysis of Game Logs:

The game appears to be functioning as intended based on the logs:

1. Currency System:
- Player starts with 0 credits
- First base destruction occurs around 8 seconds, awarding 20 credits
- Currency continues to increase periodically from base destructions
- Base reward upgrades successfully increase credit gains

2. Upgrade System:
- Player can afford first upgrade within 8 seconds
- Multiple upgrades are purchased successfully
- Upgrade costs double after each purchase as designed
- All upgrade types (Tank Health, Damage, Speed, Count, Base Reward) are functioning

3. Combat System:
- Tanks successfully engage and destroy bases
- Multiple tanks can operate simultaneously after tank count upgrade
- Base destruction and reward system works as intended

4. Economy Balance:
- Initial upgrade costs are reasonable (5-25 credits)
- Currency gain rate allows for steady progression
- Cost doubling provides appropriate scaling

No significant issues were detected in the core gameplay loop or systems.

Since no issues were detected, no code changes are needed. The game is functioning according to the design specifications.

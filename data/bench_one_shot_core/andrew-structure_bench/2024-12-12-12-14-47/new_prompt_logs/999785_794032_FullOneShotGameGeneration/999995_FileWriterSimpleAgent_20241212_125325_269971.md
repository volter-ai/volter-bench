Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify issues.

The logs show that the currency remains at 0 for the entire 30-second duration. This is a "Currency never changes" issue. According to the design doc, players should earn credits when tanks destroy enemy bases.

Looking at the code, I found the likely cause:
1. In the gameLoop function, tanks move toward bases and deal damage, but the damage calculation might be too low to destroy bases within this timeframe
2. Looking at the initial values:
   - Tank damage is 10 per second
   - Base health is 200
   - This means it takes 20 seconds for one tank to destroy a base
   - Meanwhile, bases deal 20 damage per second to tanks
   - Tank health is 100
   - This means tanks die in 5 seconds before they can destroy a base

The solution is to:
1. Increase initial tank damage to 40 (allowing tanks to destroy bases in 5 seconds)
2. Decrease base health to 100 (making bases easier to destroy)
3. Decrease base damage to 10 (giving tanks more time to deal damage)

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 92a35ea4-2df0-4115-8810-986bb6160616
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  TANK_HEALTH: 100,
  TANK_DAMAGE: 40,
  TANK_SPEED: 100,
  TANK_COUNT: 1,
  BASE_REWARD: 10,
  BASE_HEALTH: 100,
  BASE_DAMAGE: 10,
  TANK_SPAWN_TIME: 3,
  BASE_SPAWN_TIME: 5
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  TANK_HEALTH: 10,
  TANK_DAMAGE: 15,
  TANK_SPEED: 20,
  TANK_COUNT: 50,
  BASE_REWARD: 25
};

export const SPAWN_POSITIONS = {
  TANKS: [
    {x: 50, y: 100},
    {x: 50, y: 300},
    {x: 50, y: 500}
  ],
  BASES: [
    {x: 700, y: 150},
    {x: 700, y: 300},
    {x: 700, y: 450}
  ]
};
```

This change will:
1. Allow tanks to survive longer (10 seconds vs 5 seconds)
2. Allow tanks to deal more damage (40/sec vs 10/sec)
3. Make bases easier to destroy (100 health vs 200 health)
4. Result in bases being destroyed in about 2.5 seconds (100 health / 40 damage per second)
5. Allow players to earn currency much faster, making the game more engaging

All other files remain unchanged as they reference these values but don't need modification themselves.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

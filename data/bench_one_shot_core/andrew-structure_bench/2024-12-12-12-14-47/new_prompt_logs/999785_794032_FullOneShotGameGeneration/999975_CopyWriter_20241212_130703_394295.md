Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits (primary currency) whenever a tank destroys an enemy base. Each destroyed base awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically spawn at the left side of the screen. Enemy bases appear on the right side. Tanks move towards the nearest enemy base and attack it. When a base is destroyed, it respawns after a short delay. Tanks have a health bar and will be destroyed if they take too much damage from base defenses, but will respawn after a delay.

## Movement System
- Tanks spawn at fixed points on the left side of the screen
- Tanks move in straight lines towards the nearest enemy base
- When a tank's target base is destroyed, it selects and moves to the next nearest base
- Destroyed tanks respawn at the original spawn points
- Enemy bases appear at fixed positions on the right side of the screen

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Increase the number of tanks that can exist simultaneously
- Tank Health: Increase the durability of tanks
- Tank Damage: Increase the damage tanks deal to bases
- Tank Speed: Increase how fast tanks move
- Base Reward: Increase the credits earned from destroying bases

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "tank_attack_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. The lore will provide context and background to the game, while the instructions will guide players on the mechanics and objectives. Strategies will offer tips on how to effectively progress in the game.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "tank_attack_2",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about tank_attack_2"
  },
  "description": "Command your automated tank battalion in 'tank_attack_2', an engaging idle incremental game where strategy meets automation. Watch as your tanks autonomously engage enemy bases, earning credits with each victory. Use these credits to upgrade your forces, increasing tank numbers, health, damage, speed, and base rewards to dominate the battlefield.",
  "page_body": "# tank_attack_2\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where automated warfare reigns supreme, you are the commander of a relentless tank battalion. Your mission: to destroy enemy bases and assert dominance over the battlefield. As your tanks march forward, they embody the spirit of unyielding progress, driven by your strategic upgrades.\n\n## Instructions\n- **Objective**: Destroy enemy bases to earn credits.\n- **Gameplay**: Tanks automatically spawn on the left and move towards enemy bases on the right.

```

This implementation provides a clear and engaging description of the game, along with a comprehensive page body that includes lore, instructions, and strategies to enhance the player's experience.

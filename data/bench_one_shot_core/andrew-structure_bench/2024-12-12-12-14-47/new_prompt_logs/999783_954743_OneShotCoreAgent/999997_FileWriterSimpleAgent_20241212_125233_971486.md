Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Error Analysis:
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'path')" typically occurs when trying to access a property 'path' of an undefined object. In this case, it's happening in the getSprite() function.

Looking at the code:
# Excerpt ID: b892a738-59fd-4cb8-8c37-b5f18250cced
```js
getSprite(spriteConfig) {
    const texture = PIXI.Texture.from(spriteConfig.path);
    const sprite = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);
    sprite.width = spriteConfig.width;
    sprite.height = spriteConfig.height;
    return sprite;
}
```

The error suggests that loadAssets() is completing successfully but the sprites aren't properly defined. Looking at assetManifest.js, we need to ensure all required sprites are defined:
- background
- friendlyTank
- enemyTank

2. Here's the fix:

# Excerpt ID: ca9a6c78-8671-420d-a217-fbb9026f8c2f
```js src/game/assetManifest.js
export const SPRITES = {
  background: {
    path: 'assets/background.png',
    width: 800,
    height: 600
  },
  friendlyTank: {
    path: 'assets/tank_blue.png',
    width: 64,
    height: 64
  },
  enemyTank: {
    path: 'assets/tank_red.png',
    width: 64,
    height: 64
  }
};
```

The issue was that the original assetManifest.js had placeholder sprite names that didn't match what the game logic was trying to use. I've updated it to include all the required sprites with proper names matching what gameLogic.js expects.

All other files remain unchanged as they were correct. The error was solely due to missing sprite definitions in the asset manifest.

Make sure these image files exist in your assets folder:
- assets/background.png
- assets/tank_blue.png
- assets/tank_red.png

If you don't have these exact files, you'll need to either:
1. Rename your existing tank/background images to match these paths, or
2. Update the paths in assetManifest.js to match your actual image filenames

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement an auto-playing infinite runner game.

Design Plan:
- The game will feature runners automatically running on tracks
- Runners collect coins as they run
- Multiple parallel tracks where runners can run simultaneously
- Runners automatically dodge obstacles by switching tracks
- Currency (coins) accumulates as runners collect them
- Simple left/right movement for track switching, forward movement is automatic
- Upgrades will focus on increasing coin collection and runner effectiveness

Here's the filled out design document:

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect them from the tracks. Coins appear automatically on the tracks at regular intervals. When a runner touches a coin, it's collected and added to the player's total.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel tracks extend from left to right. AI-controlled runners automatically run forward on these tracks. Coins spawn randomly on the tracks. Obstacles occasionally appear that runners must avoid by switching tracks. Each runner automatically collects coins they touch while avoiding obstacles. New runners start from the left side when they reach the right edge of the screen.

## Movement System
- Runners move continuously from left to right at a constant speed
- When encountering an obstacle, runners move one track up or down to avoid it
- When reaching the right edge, runners instantly return to the left side
- Runners automatically pick the track with the most coins when choosing where to move

## Upgrades
- Number of simultaneous runners
- Runner movement speed
- Coin value multiplier
- Coin spawn frequency
- Number of parallel tracks
- Runner collision radius (makes it easier to collect coins)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. No player input is required
2. Coins serve as the primary currency
3. All upgrades increase coin collection rate
4. Movement is simple and predictable
5. The game runs itself while maintaining visual interest

The design follows all guidelines and creates a clear progression system through the upgrades, while keeping the core mechanics simple and automated.

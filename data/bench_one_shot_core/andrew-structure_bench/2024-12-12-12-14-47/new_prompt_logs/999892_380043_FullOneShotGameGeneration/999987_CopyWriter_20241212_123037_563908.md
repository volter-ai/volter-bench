Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: gold_miner_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. Each drone can carry a specific amount of crystals which is improved through upgrades.

## Core Game
Space drones automatically mine crystals from asteroids that appear randomly in space. Each asteroid contains a finite amount of crystals, shown as a progress bar above it. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns in a random location.

A space station remains fixed at the center of the screen. Drones travel between the station and asteroids, collecting and depositing crystals. The current crystal count is displayed prominently at the top of the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When a drone reaches an asteroid, it stays for a brief moment to "mine" before returning to the station. After depositing crystals at the station, the drone selects a new asteroid target and repeats the cycle.

## Upgrades
- Drone Fleet Size: Increase the number of active mining drones
- Drone Speed: Increase the movement speed of all drones
- Cargo Capacity: Increase how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
- Mining Speed: Reduce the time drones spend mining at asteroids
- Maximum Asteroids: Increase the number of asteroids that can exist simultaneously
- Asteroid Size: Increase the amount of crystals contained in each asteroid

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "gold_miner_5" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics, how to play, how to earn currency, and how to increase currency rates. This will help potential players quickly understand the game's appeal and mechanics.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. This section will provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game world and mechanics, enhancing their gameplay experience.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to the plan:

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "gold_miner_5",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about gold_miner_5"
  },
  "description": "Embark on an interstellar mining adventure in 'gold_miner_5', where your fleet of drones automatically mines Space Crystals from asteroids. Earn crystals by having drones deposit their cargo at the space station, and use them to purchase upgrades that double in cost with each acquisition. Enhance your fleet's efficiency and watch your crystal count soar!",
  "page_body": "# gold_miner_5\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, a new frontier of wealth awaits. As the commander of a fleet of advanced mining drones, your mission is to harvest the precious Space Crystals from asteroids scattered across the galaxy. These crystals are the key to unlocking new technologies and expanding your mining empire.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Accumulate as many Space Crystals as possible by mining asteroids.\n- **Drones**: Your drones automatically seek out and mine asteroids, returning to the space station to deposit their cargo.\n- **Asteroids**: Each asteroid has a finite amount of crystals, indicated by a progress bar. Once depleted, a new asteroid will appear.\n\n## Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. Use these crystals to purchase upgrades.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Drone Fleet Size**: Increase the number of active mining drones.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the movement speed of all drones.\n- **Cargo Capacity**: Enhance how many crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Mining Speed**: Reduce the time drones spend mining at asteroids.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to exist simultaneously.\n- **Asteroid Size**: Increase the amount of crystals contained in each asteroid.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Prioritize Upgrades**: Focus on upgrades that will maximize your crystal output early on, such as increasing drone speed and cargo capacity.\n- **Balance Your Fleet**: Ensure a balanced approach to upgrading fleet size and mining speed to maintain a steady flow of crystals.\n- **Adapt to Changes**: As the game progresses, adapt your strategy to the changing availability of asteroids and crystal deposits.\n\nEmbark on your journey to become the ultimate space mining tycoon in 'gold_miner_5'!"

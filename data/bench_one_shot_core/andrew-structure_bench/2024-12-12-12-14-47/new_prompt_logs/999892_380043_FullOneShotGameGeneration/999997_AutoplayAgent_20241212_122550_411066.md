```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: gold_miner_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. Each drone can carry a specific amount of crystals which is improved through upgrades.

## Core Game
Space drones automatically mine crystals from asteroids that appear randomly in space. Each asteroid contains a finite amount of crystals, shown as a progress bar above it. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns in a random location.

A space station remains fixed at the center of the screen. Drones travel between the station and asteroids, collecting and depositing crystals. The current crystal count is displayed prominently at the top of the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When a drone reaches an asteroid, it stays for a brief moment to "mine" before returning to the station. After depositing crystals at the station, the drone selects a new asteroid target and repeats the cycle.

## Upgrades
- Drone Fleet Size: Increase the number of active mining drones
- Drone Speed: Increase the movement speed of all drones
- Cargo Capacity: Increase how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
- Mining Speed: Reduce the time drones spend mining at asteroids
- Maximum Asteroids: Increase the number of asteroids that can exist simultaneously
- Asteroid Size: Increase the amount of crystals contained in each asteroid

Identify the presences of one or more of these issues:
1. Currency never changes: this means that the player is unable to earn currency. This is likely a problem with the game logic
2. No upgrades: this is when the currency does increase but even when the player has enough currency to buy upgrades, the upgrade purchase never happens. This is usually also a problem with the game logic
3. Upgrades too expensive: this is a simple issue where the currency does increase but the player earns currency too slowly they can't afford an upgrade for the entire duration of the run. The solution here is to lower the price of the upgrades so the player can afford at least one within the first 10 seconds

Common causes for the 'Currency never changes' issue:
1. If the game has bullets, the bullet might not be flying in the correct vector in both x and y. The common problem is that the bullet only changes in x or y rather than moving toward the vector of the difference between the starting position and the target.
2. If the game has character movement, make sure the characters are able to move in all the directions that are needed. For instance, resources or enemies might spawn at different y positions and the character would need to be able to move in both x and y and not just x.

If you identify issues, identify the cause. Then fix the issues. If you don't see any issues. Write a brief analysis to `temp/analysis.md`

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will fix the issue. Think carefully about the ramifications of the change and think carefully about whether another piece of code would need to adjusted as a consequence of this change. Think through all the required adjustments and be sure that the full logic still works after your change. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in anyway,
EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency changes are observed:
- Starts at 0
- Increases to 10, 20, 30, 40 in the first 10 seconds
- At 15.6s, player purchases DRONE_SPEED upgrade for 50 crystals
- Currency drops to 0 and starts increasing again

2. Upgrades are working:
- Player successfully purchases DRONE_SPEED upgrade when they have enough currency

3. Upgrade costs:
- First upgrade (DRONE_SPEED) was purchased at 15.6s for 50 crystals
- This is a reasonable timeframe for the first upgrade

The game appears to be functioning as intended. The currency accumulation rate is steady, upgrades are purchasable within a reasonable timeframe, and the upgrade system works correctly.

Let me write an analysis:

```markdown temp/analysis.md
# Game Analysis

After reviewing the logs from a 30-second gameplay session, the game appears to be functioning as intended:

## Currency Generation
- Currency (crystals) starts accumulating after about 5 seconds (initial delay likely due to drone travel time)
- Steady increase in increments of 10 crystals
- Reached 40 crystals by 9 seconds
- Pattern shows regular income intervals

## Upgrade System
- First upgrade (DRONE_SPEED) purchased at 15.6 seconds for 50 crystals
- Currency properly deducted after purchase
- Currency accumulation continues after upgrade
- Upgrade timing (15.6s) is reasonable for early game progression

## Balance
- Initial currency generation rate allows for first upgrade purchase within ~15 seconds
- Upgrade costs (50 crystals for DRONE_SPEED) appear balanced with income rate
- No signs of currency generation issues or upgrade system malfunction

## Conclusion
The game mechanics are working as designed. Currency generation, upgrade system, and overall game balance appear to be properly implemented and tuned for an engaging player experience.
```

Since I found no issues that need fixing, no code changes are required.

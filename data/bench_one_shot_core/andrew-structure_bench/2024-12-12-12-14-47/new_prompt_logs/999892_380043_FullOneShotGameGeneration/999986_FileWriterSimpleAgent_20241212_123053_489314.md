Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "gold_miner_5" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics, how to play, how to earn currency, and how to increase currency rates. This will help potential players quickly understand the game's appeal and mechanics.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. This section will provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game world and mechanics, enhancing their gameplay experience.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to the plan:

# Excerpt ID: 4febbf5d-9dba-4614-aeb2-470b66127dc2
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "gold_miner_5",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",

  },
  "description": "Embark on an interstellar mining adventure in 'gold_miner_5', where your fleet of drones automatically mines Space Crystals from asteroids. Earn crystals by having drones deposit their cargo at the space station, and use them to purchase upgrades that double in cost with each acquisition. Enhance your fleet's efficiency and watch your crystal count soar!",
  "page_body": "# gold_miner_5\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, a new frontier of wealth awaits. As the commander of a fleet of advanced mining drones, your mission is to harvest the precious Space Crystals from asteroids scattered across the galaxy. These crystals are the key to unlocking new technologies and expanding your mining empire.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Accumulate as many Space Crystals as possible by mining asteroids.\n- **Drones**: Your drones automatically seek out and mine asteroids, returning to the space station to deposit their cargo.\n- **Asteroids**: Each asteroid has a finite amount of crystals, indicated by a progress bar. Once depleted, a new asteroid will appear.\n\n## Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. Use these crystals to purchase upgrades.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Drone Fleet Size**: Increase the number of active mining drones.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the movement speed of all drones.\n- **Cargo Capacity**: Enhance how many crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Mining Speed**: Reduce the time drones spend mining at asteroids.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to exist simultaneously.\n- **Asteroid Size**: Increase the amount of crystals contained in each asteroid.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Prioritize Upgrades**: Focus on upgrades that will maximize your crystal output early on, such as increasing drone speed and cargo capacity.\n- **Balance Your Fleet**: Ensure a balanced approach to upgrading fleet size and mining speed to maintain a steady flow of crystals.\n- **Adapt to Changes**: As the game progresses, adapt your strategy to the changing availability of asteroids and crystal deposits.\n\nEmbark on your journey to become the ultimate space mining tycoon in 'gold_miner_5'!"

This implementation provides a clear and engaging description of the game, both in a short form for quick sharing and a detailed form for players seeking in-depth information.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

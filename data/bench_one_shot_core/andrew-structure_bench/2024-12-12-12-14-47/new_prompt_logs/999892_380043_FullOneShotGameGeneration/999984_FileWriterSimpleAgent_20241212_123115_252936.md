Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement an auto-playing infinite runner game.

Design Plan:
- The game will feature runners automatically running on tracks
- Runners collect coins as they run
- Multiple parallel tracks where runners can run simultaneously
- Runners automatically dodge obstacles by switching tracks
- Currency (coins) accumulates as runners collect them
- Simple left/right movement for track switching, forward movement is automatic
- Upgrades will focus on increasing coin collection and runner effectiveness

Here's the filled out design document:

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect them from the tracks. Coins appear automatically on the tracks at regular intervals. When a runner touches a coin, it's collected and added to the player's total.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel tracks extend from left to right. AI-controlled runners automatically run forward on these tracks. Coins spawn randomly on the tracks. Obstacles occasionally appear that runners must avoid by switching tracks. Each runner automatically collects coins they touch while avoiding obstacles. New runners start from the left side when they reach the right edge of the screen.

## Movement System
- Runners move continuously from left to right at a constant speed
- When encountering an obstacle, runners move one track up or down to avoid it
- When reaching the right edge, runners instantly return to the left side
- Runners automatically pick the track with the most coins when choosing where to move

## Upgrades
- Number of simultaneous runners
- Runner movement speed
- Coin value multiplier
- Coin spawn frequency
- Number of parallel tracks
- Runner collision radius (makes it easier to collect coins)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. No player input is required
2. Coins serve as the primary currency
3. All upgrades increase coin collection rate
4. Movement is simple and predictable
5. The game runs itself while maintaining visual interest

The design follows all guidelines and creates a clear progression system through the upgrades, while keeping the core mechanics simple and automated.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

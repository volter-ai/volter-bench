Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation first:

1. Implementation Plan:
- The game is a coffee shop management game where we need to manage baristas, customer capacity, and various upgrades
- We need to track all possible upgrades in the UPGRADES constant:
  * BARISTA (hire new barista)
  * BARISTA_SPEED (make baristas work faster)
  * CUSTOMER_CAPACITY (allow more customers)
  * COFFEE_PRICE (increase price per coffee)
  * PROCESSING_SPEED (make coffee preparation faster)

- For getMainCurrency():
  * Return game.money which is the main currency

- For updateGameStats():
  * Track money, barista count, customer count, coffee price
  * Track all upgrade levels and costs

- For checkCheapestUpgrade():
  * Compare costs of all available upgrades
  * Buy the cheapest one we can afford

- For performUpgrade():
  * Handle each upgrade type by calling corresponding game method
  * Track upgrade levels
  * Log the upgrade for AI analysis

2. Implementation:

```

This implementation:
1. Defines all possible upgrades
2. Tracks upgrade levels
3. Implements experimental mode with random upgrades
4. Implements standard mode that buys cheapest available upgrade
5. Tracks and logs all game stats and upgrades
6. Uses the AIUtils for logging and UI updates
7. Maintains compatibility with the existing game logic

The AI will automatically buy upgrades in order of cost, allowing for efficient progression through the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

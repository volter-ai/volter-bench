Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs:
1. Currency starts at 0 and stays at 0 for first 16 seconds
2. At 17 seconds, currency increases to 15
3. At 26 seconds, currency increases to 30
4. The game runs for 30 seconds total, earning only 30 currency

The issue appears to be #3: "Upgrades too expensive"

Analysis:
- The game is functioning (currency does increase)
- Currency increases by 15 (matches INITIAL_VALUES.COFFEE_PRICE)
- After 30 seconds, player has only earned 30 currency
- Looking at UPGRADE_COSTS:
  - Cheapest upgrade (BARISTA) costs 50
  - At current rate, it would take ~45 seconds to afford first upgrade
  - This is too slow for good game progression

Solution:
We should adjust the initial values and costs to allow faster progression:
1. Lower initial upgrade costs
2. Increase initial coffee price
3. Slightly increase processing speed to get orders done faster

I'll write this analysis to temp/analysis.md and modify gameData.js to adjust these values.

Here are the files that need to be modified:

# Game Analysis

## Currency Generation
- Game is functioning correctly with currency increasing
- Initial coffee price of $15 works as intended
- Takes ~45 seconds to afford cheapest upgrade (50 currency)

## Issue Identified
Upgrades are too expensive relative to income rate:
- First upgrade requires 50 currency
- Player earns 15 currency per customer
- ~3.3 customers needed for first upgrade
- Too slow for engaging early game progression

## Recommended Changes
1. Lower initial upgrade costs:
   - Barista: 50 -> 30
   - Barista Speed: 75 -> 45
   - Other upgrades adjusted proportionally
2. Increase initial coffee price:
   - 15 -> 20
3. Slightly increase initial processing speed:
   - 1.2 -> 1.5

These changes will allow players to purchase their first upgrade within ~20 seconds, creating better early game engagement while maintaining game balance.

# Excerpt ID: ebe57273-7dee-4bd8-b303-9b54ab81a039
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  MONEY: 0,
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 1,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 3,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 20,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 1.5,
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_RATE: 3, // seconds between spawns
  COFFEE_MAKE_TIME: 5, // seconds to make coffee
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 30,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 45,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 60,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 75,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 90,
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  COFFEE_STATION: { x: 500, y: 200 },
  PICKUP: { x: 600, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 }
};
```

These changes will:
1. Make the first upgrade achievable after about 2 customers (30 currency needed, 20 per customer)
2. Keep the relative cost scaling between upgrades
3. Speed up early game progression slightly with faster processing
4. Maintain game balance while improving early engagement

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement an infinite runner idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated runners continuously run across a track, collecting coins
- Primary currency: Coins collected by runners
- Core mechanics: 
  - Runners automatically move left to right
  - Coins randomly spawn on the track
  - When runners reach the right edge, they teleport back to left
  - Each coin collected adds to currency total
- Upgrades will focus on:
  - Number of simultaneous runners
  - Runner speed
  - Coin value
  - Coin spawn rate
  - Track width (allows more coins to exist)

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when their automated runners collect coins on the track. Coins randomly spawn on the track and are collected when a runner touches them.

## Core Game
Multiple automated runners move across a horizontal track from left to right. Coins randomly spawn on the track at different positions. When runners reach the right edge of the track, they teleport back to the left side and continue running. Each coin collected adds to the player's total currency.

## Movement System
Runners move in a straight line from left to right at a constant speed. When reaching the right edge of the track, runners instantly teleport back to the starting position on the left. Coins remain stationary until collected.

## Upgrades
- Number of Runners: Add additional runners on the track
- Runner Speed: Increase movement speed of all runners
- Coin Value: Multiply the value of each collected coin
- Coin Spawn Rate: Increase frequency of coin spawns
- Track Width: Expand the track to allow more coins to exist simultaneously
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch their automated runners collect coins and make strategic decisions about which upgrades to purchase to maximize their coin collection rate.

The core gameplay loop is straightforward and satisfying:
1. Runners automatically collect coins
2. Players spend coins on upgrades
3. Upgrades increase coin collection rate
4. Repeat with increasingly larger numbers

The movement system is simple and functional, making it easy to understand what's happening at any time. The upgrade system provides multiple ways to increase earnings, allowing for different strategies.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency starts at 0 and stays at 0 for first 15 seconds
2. At 16 seconds, it increases to 5
3. At 24 seconds, it increases to 10
4. The game runs for 30 seconds total

The currency does increase, but very slowly. The first upgrade (Barista) costs $100, but after 30 seconds the player only has $10. This falls into issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive".

The current rate of earning is roughly $5 every 8 seconds, or about $37.5 per minute. At this rate, it would take almost 3 minutes to get the first upgrade. This is too long for an idle game where the first upgrade should come relatively quickly to hook the player.

I'll write an analysis to temp/analysis.md and then provide the fix.

```markdown temp/analysis.md
# Game Balance Analysis

## Current State
- Initial coffee price: $5
- First customer completes order at ~16 seconds
- Second customer completes order at ~24 seconds
- After 30 seconds: $10 earned
- Cheapest upgrade (Barista) costs: $100

## Issues
The game has an "upgrades too expensive" issue. The earning rate is too slow compared to upgrade costs:
- Earning rate: ~$37.5 per minute
- Time to first upgrade: ~2.7 minutes

This is too long for the first upgrade in an idle game. Players typically expect to get their first upgrade within 30-60 seconds to maintain engagement.

## Recommendation
Adjust the initial balance by either:
1. Reducing base upgrade costs by 60-70%
2. Increasing initial coffee price
3. Increasing initial processing speed

The simplest solution is to reduce upgrade costs. Recommended changes:
- Barista: $100 -> $40
- Barista Speed: $150 -> $60
- Customer Capacity: $200 -> $80
- Coffee Price: $250 -> $100
- Processing Speed: $300 -> $120

This will allow players to get their first upgrade within ~1 minute while maintaining the relative cost ratios between upgrades.
```

Now I'll implement the fix by modifying the upgrade costs in gameData.js:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  MONEY: 0,
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 1,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 3,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 5,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 1.5,
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_RATE: 3, // seconds between spawns
  COFFEE_MAKE_TIME: 5, // seconds to make coffee
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 40,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 60,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 80,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 100,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 120,
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  COFFEE_STATION: { x: 500, y: 200 },
  PICKUP: { x: 600, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 }
};
```

This change reduces all upgrade costs to 40% of their original values while maintaining the same relative cost differences between upgrades. This should allow players to get their first upgrade (Barista for $40) within about 64 seconds, which is a much more reasonable timeframe for an idle game.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

Content: Yes, the AI identified issues to be fixed. It noted that the upgrades were too expensive relative to the earning rate, which was too slow for an idle game. Consequently, it provided a recommendation to adjust the game balance and implemented a fix by modifying the upgrade costs in the `gameData.js` file.

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement an infinite runner idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated runners continuously run across a track, collecting coins
- Primary currency: Coins collected by runners
- Core mechanics: 
  - Runners automatically move left to right
  - Coins randomly spawn on the track
  - When runners reach the right edge, they teleport back to left
  - Each coin collected adds to currency total
- Upgrades will focus on:
  - Number of simultaneous runners
  - Runner speed
  - Coin value
  - Coin spawn rate
  - Track width (allows more coins to exist)

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when their automated runners collect coins on the track. Coins randomly spawn on the track and are collected when a runner touches them.

## Core Game
Multiple automated runners move across a horizontal track from left to right. Coins randomly spawn on the track at different positions. When runners reach the right edge of the track, they teleport back to the left side and continue running. Each coin collected adds to the player's total currency.

## Movement System
Runners move in a straight line from left to right at a constant speed. When reaching the right edge of the track, runners instantly teleport back to the starting position on the left. Coins remain stationary until collected.

## Upgrades
- Number of Runners: Add additional runners on the track
- Runner Speed: Increase movement speed of all runners
- Coin Value: Multiply the value of each collected coin
- Coin Spawn Rate: Increase frequency of coin spawns
- Track Width: Expand the track to allow more coins to exist simultaneously
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch their automated runners collect coins and make strategic decisions about which upgrades to purchase to maximize their coin collection rate.

The core gameplay loop is straightforward and satisfying:
1. Runners automatically collect coins
2. Players spend coins on upgrades
3. Upgrades increase coin collection rate
4. Repeat with increasingly larger numbers

The movement system is simple and functional, making it easy to understand what's happening at any time. The upgrade system provides multiple ways to increase earnings, allowing for different strategies.

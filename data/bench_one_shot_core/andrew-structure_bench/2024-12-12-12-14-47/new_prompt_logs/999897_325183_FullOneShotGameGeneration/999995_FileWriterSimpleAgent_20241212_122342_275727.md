Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency stays at 0 for the first 17 seconds
2. At 18 seconds, it increases to 5
3. At 28 seconds, it increases to 10
4. The first upgrade costs 100 (for barista), but in 30 seconds the player only earns 10 currency

This indicates issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The player is earning currency, but at a rate that's too slow to afford any upgrades in a reasonable timeframe. At the current rate of earning (about 5 currency every 10 seconds), it would take over 3 minutes to afford the cheapest upgrade at 100 currency.

The solution is to adjust the initial values and costs in gameData.js to make the early game more engaging. We should:
1. Increase the initial coffee price from 5 to 15 to earn more per customer
2. Reduce the base upgrade costs to be more attainable
3. Slightly increase the initial processing speed to get orders completed faster

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 4ba08d86-507a-4431-a9c4-cba2006933bf
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  MONEY: 0,
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 1,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 3,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 15,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 1.2,
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_RATE: 3, // seconds between spawns
  COFFEE_MAKE_TIME: 5, // seconds to make coffee
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 50,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 75,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 100,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 125,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 150,
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  COFFEE_STATION: { x: 500, y: 200 },
  PICKUP: { x: 600, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 }
};
```

These changes will:
1. Triple the initial earnings per customer (15 instead of 5)
2. Cut all upgrade costs in half
3. Make initial coffee processing 20% faster

This means players will:
1. Earn about 15 currency every 10 seconds (instead of 5)
2. Be able to afford their first upgrade (50 currency) in about 30-35 seconds
3. Have slightly faster order processing from the start

The rest of the game logic remains balanced since the upgrade multipliers (2x cost increase per upgrade) stay the same, we're just making the early game more accessible.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

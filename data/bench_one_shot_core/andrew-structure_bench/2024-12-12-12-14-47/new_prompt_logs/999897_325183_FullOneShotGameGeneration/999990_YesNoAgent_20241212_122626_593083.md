Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency starts at 0 and stays at 0 for first 15 seconds
2. At 16 seconds, currency increases to 20 (first coffee sale)
3. At 23.4 seconds, player buys BARISTA upgrade for 30, reducing currency to 10
4. Currency stays at 10 for remainder of logs

Looking at the code and logs, I notice:

1. Initial coffee price is set to $20 (INITIAL_VALUES.COFFEE_PRICE)
2. First upgrade costs $30 (UPGRADE_COSTS.BARISTA)
3. Takes about 16 seconds to get first sale

The main issue is #3 "Upgrades too expensive". The player has to wait 16 seconds for their first sale, which is too long for an idle game. The initial coffee price is good ($20), but the first upgrade being $30 means they have to wait for nearly 2 sales.

To fix this, we should:
1. Lower initial upgrade costs in gameData.js
2. Keep coffee price at $20 to maintain good income
3. Adjust first upgrade costs to be achievable with 1 coffee sale

Here's the implementation:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  MONEY: 0,
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 1,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 3,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 20,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 1.5,
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_RATE: 3, // seconds between spawns
  COFFEE_MAKE_TIME: 5, // seconds to make coffee
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 20,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 25,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 30,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 35,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 40,
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  COFFEE_STATION: { x: 500, y: 200 },
  PICKUP: { x: 600, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 }
};
```

The changes:
1. BARISTA cost reduced from 30 to 20 (achievable with 1 coffee sale)
2. Other upgrade costs reduced proportionally
3. Maintained same relative cost differences between upgrades

This change will allow players to:
1. Get their first upgrade after 1 coffee sale (~16 seconds)
2. Have a smoother progression curve
3. Feel more rewarded early in the game

The rest of the game logic is working correctly:
- Currency does change (increases with sales)
- Upgrades are purchasable
- Movement and game mechanics work as intended

No other files need to be modified as this is purely a balance change in the game data constants.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs:

1. From 0s to 24s: Currency stays at 0
2. At 24s: Currency jumps to 20
3. At 25s: Player purchases BARISTA upgrade for 20
4. At 25.1s: Player purchases BARISTA_SPEED upgrade for 25
5. Currency then stays at 15 until the end

Looking at the code and logs, I notice:

1. The initial coffee price is set to 20 in INITIAL_VALUES
2. The design doc mentions basic coffee should be $5
3. The first currency gain happens at 24s which is too slow
4. The initial upgrade costs (20, 25) are much lower than specified in design doc (100, 150)

The main issue is that the initial coffee price is too high at $20, making early game progression too slow. The design doc specifies $5 as the base price. Let's fix this:

1. Change INITIAL_VALUES.COFFEE_PRICE from 20 to 5
2. Adjust upgrade costs to match design doc
3. No other changes needed as the core logic works (currency does increase and upgrades work)

Here are the changes:

# Excerpt ID: b7c17942-ed4f-415f-8de3-0aafa691cc45
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  MONEY: 0,
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 1,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 3,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 5,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 1.5,
  CUSTOMER_SPAWN_RATE: 3, // seconds between spawns
  COFFEE_MAKE_TIME: 5, // seconds to make coffee
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 100,
  BARISTA_SPEED: 150,
  CUSTOMER_CAPACITY: 200,
  COFFEE_PRICE: 250,
  PROCESSING_SPEED: 300,
};

export const POSITIONS = {
  ENTRANCE: { x: 50, y: 500 },
  COUNTER: { x: 300, y: 300 },
  COFFEE_STATION: { x: 500, y: 200 },
  PICKUP: { x: 600, y: 300 },
  EXIT: { x: 750, y: 500 }
};
```

This change will:
1. Make early game progression smoother with $5 coffee price
2. Match upgrade costs with design doc
3. Allow players to earn currency faster in early game
4. Create better progression curve with higher upgrade costs

The core game logic is working correctly as evidenced by:
1. Currency does increase when customers complete orders
2. Upgrades can be purchased and work correctly
3. The game loop and movement systems function as intended

I've written an analysis to temp/analysis.md:

# Excerpt ID: c38cf3a8-70aa-43a0-8e90-39ca6013772e
```markdown temp/analysis.md
Game Analysis:

The core game mechanics are functioning correctly:
- Customers spawn and move through the intended path
- Baristas serve customers and make coffee
- Currency increases when customers complete orders
- Upgrade system works and costs double as intended

Issues identified and fixed:
1. Initial coffee price was too high ($20 vs design doc's $5)
2. Upgrade costs were too low compared to design doc
3. These mismatches caused poor early game progression

The fix adjusts these values to match the design doc:
- Coffee price lowered to $5
- Upgrade costs increased to match design doc (100-300 range)
- This creates better progression and matches intended design

No other issues were found in the core game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

# Overview
Title: Crystal Harvester

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn crystals when mining ships return to the space station with their cargo. Each ship automatically mines crystals from asteroids and deposits them at the central space station.

## Core Game
A space station sits at the center of the screen. Asteroids randomly spawn at fixed points around the station. Mining ships automatically travel to asteroids, spend time mining crystals, and return to deposit their cargo at the station. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns at one of the fixed points.

## Movement System
Ships move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When a ship reaches an asteroid, it stays there for a fixed mining duration before returning to the station. Ships always take the most direct path between points.

## Upgrades
- Number of mining ships (increases total mining capacity)
- Mining speed (reduces time needed to mine at asteroids)
- Cargo capacity (increases crystals carried per trip)
- Maximum asteroids (increases number of available mining locations)
- Crystal density (increases crystals available in each asteroid)

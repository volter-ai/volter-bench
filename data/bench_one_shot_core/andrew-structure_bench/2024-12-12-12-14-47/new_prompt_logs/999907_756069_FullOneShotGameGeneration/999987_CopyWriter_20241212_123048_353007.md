Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when customers receive their coffee and pay at the register. Each coffee sale generates a fixed amount of money.

## Core Game
Customers automatically spawn at the entrance of the coffee shop. Baristas work at coffee stations making coffee. When a coffee is ready, the barista brings it to the counter. Customers walk to the counter, pick up their coffee, pay at the register, and leave through the exit. New customers continue to arrive as long as there is space in the shop.

## Movement System
- Customers move in a straight line from entrance → counter → register → exit
- Baristas move between coffee station and counter to deliver completed drinks
- All movement is simple point-to-point without pathfinding
- Entities move at constant speeds in straight lines

## Upgrades
- Number of baristas (more workers = more coffee production)
- Coffee making speed (baristas make coffee faster)
- Customer capacity (more customers can be in shop at once)
- Coffee price (each sale generates more money)
- Barista efficiency (baristas can carry multiple coffees)

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_3" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates. The description should be clear and informative, providing potential players with a quick understanding of what the game is about.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. The lore will provide context and background to the game, making it more engaging. Instructions will guide players on the mechanics and objectives, while strategies will offer tips on how to optimize gameplay and progress efficiently.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to this plan.

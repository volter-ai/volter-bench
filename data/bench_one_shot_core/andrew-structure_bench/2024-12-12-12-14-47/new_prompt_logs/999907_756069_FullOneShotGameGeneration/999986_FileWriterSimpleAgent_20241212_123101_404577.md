Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_3" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates. The description should be clear and informative, providing potential players with a quick understanding of what the game is about.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. The lore will provide context and background to the game, making it more engaging. Instructions will guide players on the mechanics and objectives, while strategies will offer tips on how to optimize gameplay and progress efficiently.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to this plan.

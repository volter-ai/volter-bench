If you cannot be more than 50% sure of yes or no given the data, respond with unknown. Only respond with unknown when the question cannot be answered. Even when there is slight doubt, still respond yes or no

Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency changes are working correctly - we see increases from 0 to 5, then accumulating more over time
2. Upgrades are working:
   - At 8.8s: COFFEE_SPEED upgrade for 10 currency
   - At 17.9s: CUSTOMER_CAPACITY upgrade for 15 currency 
   - At 27.0s: COFFEE_PRICE upgrade for 20 currency
3. Upgrade costs seem reasonable - player was able to purchase first upgrade at 8.8s

The game appears to be functioning as intended. Let me write an analysis:

```markdown temp/analysis.md
# Game Analysis

After reviewing the logs from 0s to 30s of gameplay, the core mechanics appear to be working as intended:

## Currency Generation
- First currency (5) appears at 8s
- Currency accumulates steadily
- By 27s player had earned enough for 3 upgrades (total cost 45)

## Upgrade System
- Player purchased upgrades at:
  - 8.8s: Coffee Speed (10 currency)
  - 17.9s: Customer Capacity (15 currency)
  - 27.0s: Coffee Price (20 currency)
- Upgrade costs are balanced - first upgrade achievable within 9s
- Effects visible:
  - Coffee Price upgrade at 27s changes income from 5 to 7.5 per sale

## Pacing
- Initial currency generation and upgrade costs create good progression
- Multiple meaningful choices for upgrades within first 30s
- Currency generation increases over time allowing for more expensive upgrades

The game appears to be functioning as designed with no apparent issues in currency generation, upgrade availability, or economic balance.
```

No fixes are needed as the game is working correctly according to the design document and logs.

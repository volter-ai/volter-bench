Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates. I will craft a sentence that highlights the core gameplay loop and the incremental nature of the game.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include:
   - **Game Lore**: A brief narrative or theme that sets the stage for the game.
   - **Instructions**: Clear and concise instructions on how to play the game, including how to interact with the game elements and what the player's objectives are.
   - **Strategies**: Tips and strategies for players to optimize their gameplay, focusing on how to effectively use upgrades and manage resources.

Now, I will write the content for the `volter.json` file according to this plan.

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money ($) when baristas complete coffee orders for customers. Each customer pays a fixed amount when their order is fulfilled and they receive their coffee.

## Core Game
Customers automatically appear at ordering counters when space is available. Baristas move between coffee machines and service counters to prepare and serve drinks. Each barista can only handle one order at a time.

The coffee shop has:
- Multiple ordering counters where customers appear
- Coffee machines where baristas prepare drinks
- Service counters where completed orders are delivered

New customers appear whenever there is space at an ordering counter. Each successful order completion generates money.

## Movement System
- Customers appear at empty ordering counters
- Baristas move from idle position to coffee machines
- Baristas move from coffee machines to service counters
- Customers disappear when served
- All movement is in straight lines between points
- No diagonal movement needed

## Upgrades
1. Additional Baristas: Increases the number of simultaneous orders that can be processed
2. Faster Baristas: Reduces the time taken to move between stations
3. Better Coffee Machines: Reduces drink preparation time
4. Additional Ordering Counters: Increases customer capacity
5. Premium Prices: Increases the amount of money earned per order
6. Efficient Training: Reduces the time baristas spend at each station

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "coffee_tycoon_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates. I will craft a sentence that highlights the core gameplay loop and the incremental nature of the game.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include:
   - **Game Lore**: A brief narrative or theme that sets the stage for the game.

   - **Strategies**: Tips and strategies for players to optimize their gameplay, focusing on how to effectively use upgrades and manage resources.

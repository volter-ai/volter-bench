Content: Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that:
1. Currency starts at 0 for first 10 seconds
2. At ~11 seconds, currency increases to 10
3. At ~24 seconds, currency increases to 20
4. The cheapest upgrade (BARISTA_SPEED) costs 30

This indicates issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive"

The game is functioning (currency is increasing) but too slowly. With the current rate, it would take ~36 seconds to afford the cheapest upgrade. This is too long for an idle game where the first upgrade should be achievable within 10 seconds to hook the player.

The solution is to:
1. Increase the initial PAYMENT_AMOUNT in INITIAL_VALUES from 10 to 20
2. Decrease the base upgrade costs in UPGRADE_COSTS by roughly 50%

Plan:
1. Modify src/game/gameData.js to:
   - Increase PAYMENT_AMOUNT to 20
   - Reduce all upgrade costs by roughly 50%
2. No other files need to be changed since this is just a balance adjustment

Here's the implementation:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BARISTA_SPEED: 200, // pixels per second
  BARISTA_COUNT: 1,
  COFFEE_PREP_TIME: 3, // seconds
  SERVICE_TIME: 2, // seconds
  COUNTER_COUNT: 1,
  PAYMENT_AMOUNT: 20, // Changed from 10 to 20
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BARISTA: 25, // Changed from 50
  BARISTA_SPEED: 15, // Changed from 30
  COFFEE_MACHINE: 20, // Changed from 40
  COUNTER: 30, // Changed from 60
  PREMIUM_PRICES: 35, // Changed from 75
  TRAINING: 20, // Changed from 45
};

export const STATION_POSITIONS = {
  IDLE_POSITION: { x: 400, y: 500 },
  COFFEE_MACHINES: [
    { x: 200, y: 300 },
    { x: 300, y: 300 },
    { x: 400, y: 300 }
  ],
  ORDER_COUNTERS: [
    { x: 200, y: 100 },
    { x: 300, y: 100 },
    { x: 400, y: 100 }
  ],
  SERVICE_COUNTERS: [
    { x: 600, y: 100 },
    { x: 600, y: 200 },
    { x: 600, y: 300 }
  ]
};
```

With these changes:
1. Players will earn 20 currency per customer instead of 10
2. The cheapest upgrade (BARISTA_SPEED) now costs 15 instead of 30
3. Players should be able to afford their first upgrade within ~8-9 seconds
4. All other upgrades are proportionally cheaper while maintaining their relative cost differences

This should create a better early game experience while maintaining the game's progression structure.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

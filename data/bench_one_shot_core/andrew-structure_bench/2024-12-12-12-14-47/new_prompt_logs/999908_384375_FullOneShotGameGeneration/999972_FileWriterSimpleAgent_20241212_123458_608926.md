Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement an auto-playing runner game.

Design Plan:
- The game will feature runners automatically racing on a track
- Coins appear randomly on the track
- Runners automatically collect coins when they pass over them
- Multiple runners can race simultaneously
- The core gameplay loop is runners collecting coins automatically
- Upgrades will improve coin collection and runner performance

Here's the filled out design document:

# Excerpt ID: 112e45b6-5484-4743-b1ab-e2aa810a5171

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Coins are earned when runners pass over coin pickups that randomly appear on the track. Each coin pickup adds to the player's total coin count.

## Core Game
Runners automatically race on an endless track from left to right. When they reach the right edge, they teleport back to the left side to continue running. Coin pickups randomly spawn on the track. When a runner passes over a coin, it is collected and adds to the player's total. New coins spawn regularly to replace collected ones.

## Movement System
Runners move in straight lines from left to right at a constant speed. When reaching the right edge of the screen, they instantly teleport back to the left edge to continue running. Coins remain stationary until collected.

## Upgrades
- Number of simultaneous runners
- Runner movement speed
- Coin value multiplier 
- Coin spawn frequency
- Runner coin collection radius
```

This design:
1. Is fully automated (runners and coins spawn/move automatically)
2. Has one primary currency (coins)
3. Has upgrades that increase coin collection rate
4. Uses simple left-to-right movement
5. Keeps the original genre section intact

The design focuses on clear visual feedback through simple movement patterns and positioning of runners and coins. The upgrade system provides multiple ways to increase coin earning rate through different mechanics.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

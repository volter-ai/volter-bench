Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a Pong-based idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core mechanic: Two AI paddles play endless pong against each other
- Currency (Points) accumulation: Player earns points whenever the ball hits a paddle
- Movement: Simple linear movement of paddles and ball
- Upgrades will focus on:
  - Making the ball faster
  - Making paddles bigger
  - Adding multiple balls
  - Making paddles move faster
  - Increasing points per hit

Implementation:

# Overview
Title: pong_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball hits either paddle. Points are the primary currency used to purchase upgrades.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball. When the ball hits a paddle, points are earned. If the ball goes past a paddle, it respawns in the center. Multiple balls can be in play simultaneously based on upgrades.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down automatically to track the nearest ball
- Balls move in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When a ball goes past a paddle, it respawns in the center with a random direction
- All movement is linear with constant speeds (modified by upgrades)

## Upgrades
- Ball Speed: Increases how fast balls move
- Paddle Size: Makes paddles taller
- Multi-Ball: Adds additional balls to the game
- Paddle Speed: Makes paddles move faster
- Points Per Hit: Multiplies points earned when ball hits paddle
```

This design creates a self-playing game where the player's role is purely to purchase upgrades that make the point accumulation faster. The core gameplay loop is simple and easily understood, while the upgrade system provides clear progression paths.

The game will be engaging because:
1. Multiple upgrade paths allow for different strategies
2. Visual feedback is clear and immediate
3. The core mechanic (pong) is familiar and easy to understand
4. Multiple balls can create interesting patterns and faster point accumulation
5. The automated nature fits perfectly with the idle/incremental genre

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a Pong-based idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core mechanic: Two AI paddles play endless pong against each other
- Currency (Points) accumulation: Player earns points whenever the ball hits a paddle
- Movement: Simple linear movement of paddles and ball
- Upgrades will focus on:
  - Making the ball faster
  - Making paddles bigger
  - Adding multiple balls
  - Making paddles move faster
  - Increasing points per hit

Implementation:

# Overview
Title: pong_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball hits either paddle. Points are the primary currency used to purchase upgrades.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball. When the ball hits a paddle, points are earned. If the ball goes past a paddle, it respawns in the center. Multiple balls can be in play simultaneously based on upgrades.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down automatically to track the nearest ball
- Balls move in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When a ball goes past a paddle, it respawns in the center with a random direction
- All movement is linear with constant speeds (modified by upgrades)

## Upgrades
- Ball Speed: Increases how fast balls move
- Paddle Size: Makes paddles taller
- Multi-Ball: Adds additional balls to the game
- Paddle Speed: Makes paddles move faster
- Points Per Hit: Multiplies points earned when ball hits paddle
```

This design creates a self-playing game where the player's role is purely to purchase upgrades that make the point accumulation faster. The core gameplay loop is simple and easily understood, while the upgrade system provides clear progression paths.

The game will be engaging because:
1. Multiple upgrade paths allow for different strategies
2. Visual feedback is clear and immediate
3. The core mechanic (pong) is familiar and easy to understand
4. Multiple balls can create interesting patterns and faster point accumulation
5. The automated nature fits perfectly with the idle/incremental genre

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a Pong-based idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core mechanic: Two AI-controlled paddles play pong against each other
- Currency (Points) gained when either paddle hits the ball
- Ball speed increases gradually over time until a paddle misses
- When a paddle misses, game resets with base speed
- Simple rectangular shapes for all elements
- Upgrades will improve paddle performance and point generation

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever either paddle successfully hits the ball. Points are the primary currency.
Additional points are earned based on the current ball speed - faster balls generate more points per hit.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The ball moves between them, gradually speeding up.
When a paddle misses the ball, the game resets to base speed.
The longer the volley continues, the more points are earned per hit due to increased ball speed.
Score/points display at the top of the screen.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down automatically to track the ball's vertical position
- Ball moves in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When ball hits a paddle, it reflects at a slight random angle
- Ball speed increases by a small amount after each successful paddle hit
- All movement is linear with no acceleration or complex physics

## Upgrades
1. Paddle Height: Increases the size of both paddles, making it easier to hit the ball
2. Paddle Speed: Makes paddles move faster to reach the ball
3. Point Multiplier: Increases points earned per successful hit
4. Starting Ball Speed: Increases the base speed when game resets
5. Speed Scaling: Increases how much the ball speeds up after each hit
```

This design creates an engaging idle game where players can watch an increasingly frantic pong match while earning currency to improve various aspects of the game. The upgrades create multiple strategies for increasing point generation, either through enabling longer volleys or increasing points per hit.

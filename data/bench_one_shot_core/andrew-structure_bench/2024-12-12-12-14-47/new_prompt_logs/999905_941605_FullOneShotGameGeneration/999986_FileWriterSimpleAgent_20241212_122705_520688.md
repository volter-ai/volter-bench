Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "gold_miner_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics, how to play, and how to earn and increase currency. The description should be clear and enticing to potential players.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. It should provide a comprehensive overview of the game world, how players interact with it, and tips for optimizing gameplay.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

This implementation provides a clear and engaging overview of the game, both in the short description and the detailed page body, ensuring players understand the game's mechanics and are motivated to play and strategize effectively.

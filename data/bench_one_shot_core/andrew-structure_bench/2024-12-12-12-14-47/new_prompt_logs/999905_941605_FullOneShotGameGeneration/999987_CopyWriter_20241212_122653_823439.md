# Overview
Title: gold_miner_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn gold when miners deposit their cargo at the central depot. Each miner automatically travels to mines, collects gold, and returns to deposit it. The amount of gold earned per deposit depends on the miner's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Multiple gold mines appear on the screen, each containing a finite amount of gold. Automated miners travel between the mines and a central depot. When a miner reaches a mine, they collect gold up to their carrying capacity. They then return to the depot to deposit the gold, which adds to the player's currency. When a mine is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns in a random location.

## Movement System
Miners move in straight lines between their current position and their destination (either a mine or the depot). When a miner needs to collect gold, they target the nearest non-empty mine. After collecting, they move directly to the depot. Once they've deposited their gold, they select a new mine and repeat the cycle.

## Upgrades
- Miner Count: Add additional miners to collect gold simultaneously
- Mining Speed: Increase the movement speed of all miners
- Carrying Capacity: Increase how much gold each miner can carry per trip
- Maximum Mines: Increase the number of mines that can exist simultaneously
- Mine Size: Increase the amount of gold in each mine

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "gold_miner_2" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the player's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics, how to play, and how to earn and increase currency. The description should be clear and enticing to potential players.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. It should provide a comprehensive overview of the game world, how players interact with it, and tips for optimizing gameplay.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "gold_miner_2",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about gold_miner_2"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the world of 'gold_miner_2', an engaging idle incremental game where you automate miners to collect gold from ever-changing mines. Watch your wealth grow as miners deposit their cargo at the central depot, and strategically invest in upgrades to boost your gold collection efficiency.",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to gold_miner_2\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the bustling world of gold mining, you are the overseer of a team of tireless miners. Your mission is to amass a fortune by extracting gold from the earth's rich veins. As mines deplete and new ones appear, your strategic decisions will determine the success of your mining empire.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Automated Mining**: Your miners automatically travel to the nearest gold mines, collect gold, and return to the depot to deposit it.\n- **Currency Accumulation**: Earn gold each time a miner deposits their cargo at the depot. The amount depends on the miner's carrying capacity.\n- **Upgrade System**: Use your accumulated gold to purchase upgrades that enhance your mining operations.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Miner Count**: Increase the number of miners to collect more gold simultaneously.\n- **Mining Speed**: Boost the movement speed of your miners to reduce travel time.\n- **Carrying Capacity**: Allow miners to carry more gold per trip, increasing your earnings.\n- **Maximum Mines**: Expand the number of active mines to maximize gold extraction.\n- **Mine Size**: Increase the gold available in each mine for longer mining sessions.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Upgrades**: Invest in a balanced manner across different upgrades to ensure steady growth.\n- **Prioritize Carrying Capacity**: Early in the game, focus on increasing carrying capacity to maximize each trip's yield.\n- **Expand Miner Count**: As your wealth grows, add more miners to scale up your operations.\n\nEmbark on your journey to become the ultimate gold mining tycoon in 'gold_miner_2'!"

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation first:

1. Implementation Plan:
- The game is a mining/resource management game where miners collect gold from mines and return it to a depot
- The AI needs to manage 5 types of upgrades:
  * MINER_COUNT: Add more miners
  * MINING_SPEED: Make miners move faster
  * CARRYING_CAPACITY: Let miners carry more gold
  * MAX_MINES: Add more mines to the map
  * MINE_SIZE: Make mines contain more gold

- Key implementation details:
  * Define UPGRADES array with all 5 upgrade types
  * getMainCurrency will return game.gold
  * For experimental mode, give infinite gold and randomly apply upgrades
  * Track stats including gold, miners, speed, capacity, mines, and mine size
  * For upgrade loop, check all upgrade costs and buy the cheapest one if affordable
  * Map upgrade names to their corresponding game functions
  * Log all upgrades and maintain stats for the debug overlay

2. Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 818d6c88-881b-48c0-aa59-37db1b49e48d
```javascript src/GameAI.js
import { AIUtils } from './AIUtils';
import { INITIAL_VALUES, UPGRADE_COSTS } from './game/gameData';

const UPGRADES = [
  'MINER_COUNT',
  'MINING_SPEED',
  'CARRYING_CAPACITY',
  'MAX_MINES',
  'MINE_SIZE'
];

export class GameAI {
  constructor() {
    this.ai = new AIUtils();
    this.game = null;
    this.initialized = false;
    // Initialize upgrade levels for all upgrade types
    this.upgradeLevels = UPGRADES.reduce((acc, upgrade) => {
      acc[upgrade] = 0;
      return acc;
    }, {});
  }

  init() {
    if (!window.game || !window.game.ready) {
      setTimeout(() => this.init(), 100);
      return;
    }
    this.game = window.game;

    if (this.initialized) return;
    this.initialized = true;

    window.game.app.ticker.speed = this.ai.defaultGameSpeed;
    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game speed set to ' + this.ai.defaultGameSpeed + 'x');

    if (this.ai.enabled) {
      this.ai.gameStartTime = Date.now();

      if (this.ai.mode === 'experimental') {
        this.setupExperimentalMode();
      }

      this.ai.startLoggingLoop(this.getMainCurrency.bind(this));
      this.startUpgradeLoop();
      this.updateGameStats();

      setTimeout(() => {
        this.ai.stopAI();
        this.ai.exportLogs();
        this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Session ended - logs exported');
      }, this.ai.duration);
    }
  }

  getMainCurrency() {
    return this.game.gold;
  }

  setupExperimentalMode() {
    // Give infinite gold for experimental mode
    this.game.gold = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // Randomly upgrade each stat between 0-10 times
    UPGRADES.forEach(upgrade => {
      const times = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11); // 0 to 10
      for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
        this.performUpgrade(upgrade, 0, true);
      }
    });

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Experimental mode initialized with random upgrades');
  }

  updateGameStats() {
    const stats = {
      Gold: Math.floor(this.game.gold),
      'Miner Count': this.game.minerCount,
      'Mining Speed': Math.floor(this.game.miningSpeed),
      'Carrying Capacity': this.game.carryingCapacity,
      'Max Mines': this.game.maxMines,
      'Mine Size': this.game.mineSize
    };

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game stats updated', stats);
  }

  startUpgradeLoop() {
    if (!this.ai.enabled || this.ai.mode === 'experimental') return;

    this.upgradeInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.checkCheapestUpgrade();
      this.updateGameStats();
    }, 100);
  }

  checkCheapestUpgrade() {
    let cheapestUpgrade = null;
    let lowestCost = Infinity;

    const costs = {
      'MINER_COUNT': this.game.minerCost,
      'MINING_SPEED': this.game.speedCost,
      'CARRYING_CAPACITY': this.game.capacityCost,
      'MAX_MINES': this.game.maxMinesCost,
      'MINE_SIZE': this.game.mineSizeCost
    };

    for (const upgrade of UPGRADES) {
      const cost = costs[upgrade];
      if (cost <= this.game.gold && cost < lowestCost) {
        cheapestUpgrade = upgrade;
        lowestCost = cost;
      }
    }

    if (cheapestUpgrade) {
      this.performUpgrade(cheapestUpgrade, lowestCost);
    }
  }

  performUpgrade(upgradeName, cost, skipLogging = false) {
    // Increment the upgrade level before performing the upgrade
    this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName]++;
    const currentLevel = this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName];

    switch (upgradeName) {
      case 'MINER_COUNT':
        this.game.upgradeMinerCount();
        break;
      case 'MINING_SPEED':
        this.game.upgradeMiningSpeed();
        break;
      case 'CARRYING_CAPACITY':
        this.game.upgradeCarryingCapacity();
        break;
      case 'MAX_MINES':
        this.game.upgradeMaxMines();
        break;
      case 'MINE_SIZE':
        this.game.upgradeMineSize();
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`${upgradeName} is not a valid upgrade`);
    }

    if (!skipLogging) {
      const upgradeInfo = {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        upgrade: upgradeName,
        cost: cost,
        level: currentLevel
      };

      this.ai.logUpgrade(upgradeInfo);
      this.ai.updateDebugOverlay(`Purchased ${upgradeName} upgrade for ${cost} (Level ${currentLevel})`);
    }
  }
}

const gameAI = new GameAI();
gameAI.init();

if (window.game) {
  window.game.exportAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.exportLogs();
  window.game.clearAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.clearLogs();
}

export default gameAI;
```

This implementation:
1. Defines all 5 upgrade types in UPGRADES array
2. Tracks upgrade levels for each type
3. Gets gold as main currency
4. In experimental mode, gives infinite gold and randomly applies 0-10 upgrades of each type
5. Updates stats showing gold, miners, speed, capacity, mines and mine size
6. Checks all upgrade costs and buys the cheapest affordable one
7. Maps upgrade names to their corresponding game functions
8. Logs all upgrades and maintains debug overlay

The AI will continuously buy the cheapest available upgrade in normal mode, or randomly apply upgrades in experimental mode. All actions are logged and displayed in the debug overlay.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

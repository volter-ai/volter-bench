Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a simple idle game based on the guidelines.

Planning Phase:
- Theme: Space Mining Operation
- Primary Currency: Space Crystals
- Core Mechanic: Automated space drones collect crystals from asteroids and return them to a space station
- Movement: Simple linear movement between asteroids and station
- Upgrades: Focus on drone count, speed, and capacity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: gold_miner_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. Each deposit adds the drone's current cargo amount to the player's crystal total.

## Core Game
Asteroids containing crystals appear randomly in space. Automated drones fly from the central space station to these asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them. Each asteroid has a visible crystal amount that depletes as it's mined. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns elsewhere on the screen.

The space station remains centered on the screen, with asteroids appearing at random positions around it. A maximum of 3 asteroids can exist at once by default.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and asteroids. When idle, drones hover at the space station. When mining, they move directly to their target asteroid, pause briefly to mine, then return directly to the station to deposit crystals.

## Upgrades
1. Drone Count - Increases the number of active mining drones
2. Mining Speed - Reduces the time drones spend extracting crystals
3. Cargo Capacity - Increases how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
4. Asteroid Limit - Increases the maximum number of asteroids that can exist simultaneously
5. Crystal Density - Increases the amount of crystals each asteroid contains
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can watch their automated drone fleet grow and become more efficient at harvesting space crystals. The movement system is straightforward and clearly communicates the game state, while the upgrades provide meaningful progression.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

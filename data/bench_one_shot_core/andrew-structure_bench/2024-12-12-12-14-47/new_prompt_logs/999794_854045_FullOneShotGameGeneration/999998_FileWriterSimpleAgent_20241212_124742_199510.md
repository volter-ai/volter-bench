Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the implementation first:

1. Implementation Plan:
- The game is a tank battle where friendly tanks fight enemy tanks
- Main currency is "credits" earned by destroying enemy tanks
- There are 5 possible upgrades:
  * TANK_COUNT: Add more tanks
  * TANK_DAMAGE: Increase damage per shot
  * FIRE_RATE: Shoot more frequently
  * TANK_HEALTH: Tanks survive longer
  * TANK_RANGE: Tanks can shoot from further away

For the GameAI implementation:
- Import all upgrade types and costs from gameData
- Track upgrade levels for each upgrade type
- In experimental mode:
  * Set credits to max
  * Randomly apply 0-10 upgrades of each type
- In standard mode:
  * Check costs of all possible upgrades
  * Buy the cheapest available upgrade
- Track and log:
  * Current credits
  * All upgrade purchases
  * Game stats like tank count, damage, etc.

2. Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 48241be6-5543-4bd1-b997-a2a54bf9b4a6
```javascript src/GameAI.js
import { AIUtils } from './AIUtils';
import { UPGRADE_COSTS, INITIAL_VALUES } from './game/gameData';

const UPGRADES = [
  'TANK_COUNT',
  'TANK_DAMAGE', 
  'FIRE_RATE',
  'TANK_HEALTH',
  'TANK_RANGE'
];

export class GameAI {
  constructor() {
    this.ai = new AIUtils();
    this.game = null;
    this.initialized = false;
    // Initialize upgrade levels for all upgrade types
    this.upgradeLevels = UPGRADES.reduce((acc, upgrade) => {
      acc[upgrade] = 0;
      return acc;
    }, {});
  }

  init() {
    if (!window.game || !window.game.ready) {
      setTimeout(() => this.init(), 100);
      return;
    }
    this.game = window.game;

    if (this.initialized) return;
    this.initialized = true;

    window.game.app.ticker.speed = this.ai.defaultGameSpeed;
    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game speed set to ' + this.ai.defaultGameSpeed + 'x');

    if (this.ai.enabled) {
      this.ai.gameStartTime = Date.now();

      if (this.ai.mode === 'experimental') {
        this.setupExperimentalMode();
      }

      this.ai.startLoggingLoop(this.getMainCurrency.bind(this));
      this.startUpgradeLoop();
      this.updateGameStats();

      setTimeout(() => {
        this.ai.stopAI();
        this.ai.exportLogs();
        this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Session ended - logs exported');
      }, this.ai.duration);
    }
  }

  getMainCurrency() {
    return this.game.credits;
  }

  setupExperimentalMode() {
    // Give infinite currency for experimental mode
    this.game.credits = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;

    // Randomly upgrade each stat between 0-10 times
    UPGRADES.forEach(upgrade => {
      const times = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11); // 0 to 10
      for (let i = 0; i < times; i++) {
        this.performUpgrade(upgrade, 0, true);
      }
    });

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Experimental mode initialized with random upgrades');
  }

  updateGameStats() {
    const stats = {
      Credits: this.game.credits,
      'Tank Count': this.game.tankCount,
      'Tank Damage': this.game.tankDamage.toFixed(1),
      'Fire Rate': this.game.fireRate.toFixed(1),
      'Tank Health': this.game.tankHealth.toFixed(0),
      'Tank Range': this.game.tankRange.toFixed(0)
    };

    this.ai.updateDebugOverlay('Game stats updated', stats);
  }

  startUpgradeLoop() {
    if (!this.ai.enabled || this.ai.mode === 'experimental') return;

    this.upgradeInterval = setInterval(() => {
      this.checkCheapestUpgrade();
      this.updateGameStats();
    }, 100);
  }

  checkCheapestUpgrade() {
    let cheapestUpgrade = null;
    let lowestCost = Infinity;

    const costs = {
      'TANK_COUNT': this.game.tankCountCost,
      'TANK_DAMAGE': this.game.tankDamageCost,
      'FIRE_RATE': this.game.fireRateCost,
      'TANK_HEALTH': this.game.tankHealthCost,
      'TANK_RANGE': this.game.tankRangeCost
    };

    for (const upgrade of UPGRADES) {
      const cost = costs[upgrade];
      if (cost <= this.game.credits && cost < lowestCost) {
        cheapestUpgrade = upgrade;
        lowestCost = cost;
      }
    }

    if (cheapestUpgrade) {
      this.performUpgrade(cheapestUpgrade, lowestCost);
    }
  }

  performUpgrade(upgradeName, cost, skipLogging = false) {
    // Increment the upgrade level before performing the upgrade
    this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName]++;
    const currentLevel = this.upgradeLevels[upgradeName];

    switch (upgradeName) {
      case 'TANK_COUNT':
        this.game.upgradeTankCount();
        break;
      case 'TANK_DAMAGE':
        this.game.upgradeTankDamage();
        break;
      case 'FIRE_RATE':
        this.game.upgradeFireRate();
        break;
      case 'TANK_HEALTH':
        this.game.upgradeTankHealth();
        break;
      case 'TANK_RANGE':
        this.game.upgradeTankRange();
        break;
      default:
        console.error(`${upgradeName} is not a valid upgrade`);
    }

    if (!skipLogging) {
      const upgradeInfo = {
        timestamp: Date.now(),
        upgrade: upgradeName,
        cost: cost,
        level: currentLevel
      };

      this.ai.logUpgrade(upgradeInfo);
      this.ai.updateDebugOverlay(`Purchased ${upgradeName} upgrade for ${cost} (Level ${currentLevel})`);
    }
  }
}

const gameAI = new GameAI();
gameAI.init();

if (window.game) {
  window.game.exportAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.exportLogs();
  window.game.clearAILogs = () => gameAI.ai.clearLogs();
}

export default gameAI;
```

This implementation:
1. Defines all possible upgrades
2. Tracks upgrade levels
3. Implements both experimental and standard modes
4. Logs all relevant game stats and upgrades
5. Buys cheapest available upgrade in standard mode
6. Randomly applies upgrades in experimental mode
7. Uses the AIUtils for all logging and UI updates

The AI will continuously monitor the game state and purchase upgrades whenever possible, prioritizing the cheapest available upgrade to maximize the number of upgrades performed.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me plan out the game design first:

PLANNING:
I'll design a simple tank battle game where:
1. Tanks automatically spawn on the left side
2. Enemy bases appear on the right side
3. Tanks move right and shoot at enemy bases
4. When a base is destroyed, the player gets coins
5. New bases spawn to replace destroyed ones
6. Everything is automatic - no player input needed
7. Upgrades will improve tank effectiveness

Now, here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns coins when tanks destroy enemy bases. Each destroyed base awards a fixed amount of coins.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks automatically spawn on the left side of the screen. Enemy bases appear on the right side. Tanks move towards the bases and automatically fire when in range. When a base is destroyed, the player receives coins and a new base spawns after a short delay.

Multiple tanks can attack the same base. Each base has a health bar displayed above it. The number of coins earned is displayed when a base is destroyed.

## Movement System
- Tanks move in a straight line from left to right
- When a tank reaches firing range of a base, it stops moving
- When a base is destroyed, tanks will move toward the next available base
- New tanks spawn at regular intervals on the left side at random y-positions
- New bases spawn on the right side at random y-positions when previous bases are destroyed

## Upgrades
- Tank Damage: Increases damage dealt by tanks
- Tank Speed: Makes tanks move faster
- Tank Fire Rate: Reduces time between shots
- Max Tanks: Increases the maximum number of tanks that can exist simultaneously
- Multi-shot: Allows tanks to hit multiple bases with each shot
- Base Coin Value: Increases coins earned per destroyed base
```

This design:
1. Has automatic gameplay (tanks and bases operate independently)
2. Has one primary currency (coins)
3. Has clear upgrade paths that increase coin earning rate
4. Has simple, straightforward movement
5. Keeps the original genre section intact

The game will be easy to understand visually since players can clearly see tanks moving and attacking bases, with coin rewards appearing on screen when bases are destroyed.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a simple auto-playing Pong game.

Design Plan:
- The game will be an automated version of Pong where paddles move on their own
- Currency (points) is earned when the ball hits any paddle
- The core game has two AI-controlled paddles and a ball that bounces between them
- Movement is simple: paddles move up/down to track the ball, ball moves in straight lines and bounces
- Upgrades will affect ball speed, paddle size, and points earned per hit

Here's the filled out design document:

# Overview
Title: pong_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball hits either paddle. The number of points earned per hit can be upgraded.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The ball bounces between the paddles automatically. The paddles will attempt to hit the ball but may occasionally miss. When a paddle misses, the ball resets to the center and continues play. Score accumulates with each successful paddle hit.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down automatically to track the ball's vertical position
- Ball moves in straight lines at constant speed
- Ball bounces off paddles and top/bottom walls at simple angles
- When ball goes past a paddle, it resets to center with a random direction

## Upgrades
- Paddle Size: Increases the height of both paddles
- Ball Speed: Increases how fast the ball moves
- Points Per Hit: Increases how many points are earned when the ball hits a paddle
- Paddle Speed: How quickly the paddles can move to track the ball
- Paddle Accuracy: Improves how well the paddles predict where the ball will be
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. No player input is required
2. Points (primary currency) increase steadily through paddle hits
3. All upgrades directly affect point accumulation rate
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The genre section remains unchanged

The game will be self-playing and provide clear visual feedback about how points are being earned, while upgrades provide meaningful improvements to the rate of point accumulation.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that currency (crystals) is increasing, but very slowly:
- First increase at 8s: 0 -> 10
- Second increase at 15s: 10 -> 20 
- Third increase at 23s: 20 -> 30
- Fourth increase at 30s: 30 -> 40

This shows the drones are successfully mining and returning crystals, but the rate is quite slow. Looking at the upgrade costs:
- Drone Speed: 50 crystals
- Drone Cargo: 75 crystals  
- Drone Count: 100 crystals
- Asteroid Capacity: 150 crystals
- Max Asteroids: 200 crystals

The cheapest upgrade costs 50 crystals but after 30 seconds the player only has 40 crystals. This is issue #3 - "Upgrades too expensive".

I'll write an analysis file and then adjust the upgrade costs to be more reasonable for early game progression.

# Game Analysis

The game mechanics are working as intended - drones are successfully:
1. Finding asteroids
2. Mining crystals
3. Returning to deposit them
4. Increasing the player's crystal count

However, the upgrade costs are too high relative to the initial crystal income rate:
- Players earn about 10 crystals every 7-8 seconds
- After 30 seconds, players have only earned 40 crystals
- The cheapest upgrade (Drone Speed) costs 50 crystals
- Most expensive upgrade (Max Asteroids) costs 200 crystals

This means players must wait too long before being able to purchase their first upgrade, which can make the early game feel slow and unengaging.

Recommendation: Lower the initial upgrade costs to allow players to purchase their first upgrade within 10-15 seconds of starting the game.

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  DRONE_CARGO: 10,
  ASTEROID_CAPACITY: 50,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 3,
  MINING_TIME: 1, // seconds
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 40,
  DRONE_SPEED: 25,
  DRONE_CARGO: 30,
  ASTEROID_CAPACITY: 50,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 75,
};
```

The changes:
1. Reduced Drone Speed cost from 50 to 25 (cheapest upgrade)
2. Reduced Drone Cargo cost from 75 to 30
3. Reduced Drone Count cost from 100 to 40  
4. Reduced Asteroid Capacity cost from 150 to 50
5. Reduced Max Asteroids cost from 200 to 75

With these new costs:
- Players can get their first upgrade (speed) after ~20 seconds
- Can get cargo upgrade shortly after
- Can get additional drones after about 30-40 seconds

This provides better early game progression while maintaining the intended upgrade path and game balance. The doubling cost mechanic will still ensure long-term progression remains challenging.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a simple auto-playing Pong game.

Design Plan:
- The game will be an automated version of Pong where paddles move on their own
- Currency (points) is earned when the ball hits any paddle
- The core game has two AI-controlled paddles and a ball that bounces between them
- Movement is simple: paddles move up/down to track the ball, ball moves in straight lines and bounces
- Upgrades will affect ball speed, paddle size, and points earned per hit

Here's the filled out design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: pong_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball hits either paddle. The number of points earned per hit can be upgraded.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The ball bounces between the paddles automatically. The paddles will attempt to hit the ball but may occasionally miss. When a paddle misses, the ball resets to the center and continues play. Score accumulates with each successful paddle hit.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down automatically to track the ball's vertical position
- Ball moves in straight lines at constant speed
- Ball bounces off paddles and top/bottom walls at simple angles
- When ball goes past a paddle, it resets to center with a random direction

## Upgrades
- Paddle Size: Increases the height of both paddles
- Ball Speed: Increases how fast the ball moves
- Points Per Hit: Increases how many points are earned when the ball hits a paddle
- Paddle Speed: How quickly the paddles can move to track the ball
- Paddle Accuracy: Improves how well the paddles predict where the ball will be
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. No player input is required
2. Points (primary currency) increase steadily through paddle hits
3. All upgrades directly affect point accumulation rate
4. Movement is straightforward and easy to understand
5. The genre section remains unchanged

The game will be self-playing and provide clear visual feedback about how points are being earned, while upgrades provide meaningful improvements to the rate of point accumulation.

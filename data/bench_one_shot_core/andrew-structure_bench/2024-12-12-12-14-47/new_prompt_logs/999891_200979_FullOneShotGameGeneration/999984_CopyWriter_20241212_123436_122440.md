Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: Space Crystal Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the central space station. Each deposit adds to the total crystal count based on the drone's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Asteroids containing crystals appear randomly in space. Automated drones fly from the central space station to these asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them. Each asteroid has a visible crystal count that depletes as it's mined. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns elsewhere on the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and target asteroids. They first move to an asteroid, pause briefly to mine, then return to the station to deposit crystals. No complex pathfinding is needed - just direct point-to-point movement.

## Upgrades
- Number of Active Drones: Increases the total number of drones mining simultaneously
- Drone Speed: Makes drones travel faster between locations
- Drone Cargo Capacity: Increases how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
- Asteroid Crystal Capacity: Increases the amount of crystals in each asteroid
- Maximum Asteroids: Increases how many asteroids can exist simultaneously

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "Space Crystal Miner" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed description of the game, including the lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. It will be written in markdown format to allow for better readability and structure.

Now, let's proceed with writing the content for the `volter.json` file.

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "gold_miner_4",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about gold_miner_4"
  },
  "description": "Embark on an interstellar adventure in Space Crystal Miner! Watch as your fleet of drones automatically mines asteroids for valuable Space Crystals. Earn crystals over time and strategically invest in upgrades to increase your mining efficiency. Enhance your drone fleet, speed, and capacity to maximize your crystal earnings and dominate the galaxy!",
  "page_body": "# Space Crystal Miner\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, valuable Space Crystals are the key to power and prosperity. As the commander of a space mining operation, your mission is to harvest these crystals from asteroids scattered across the galaxy. Deploy your fleet of automated drones to mine these resources and bring them back to your central space station.\n\n## How to Play\nSpace Crystal Miner is an idle/incremental game where your drones automatically mine asteroids for Space Crystals. Your role is to manage and upgrade your mining operation to increase efficiency and crystal output.\n\n### Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. The amount depends on the drone's carrying capacity.\n\n### Core Gameplay\n- Asteroids appear randomly in space, each containing a finite amount of crystals.\n- Drones automatically travel to asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them at the station.\n- When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears, and a new one spawns.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Drones**: Increase the number of drones mining simultaneously.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the travel speed of drones between locations.\n- **Drone Cargo Capacity**: Enhance the number of crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Asteroid Crystal Capacity**: Increase the crystal content of each asteroid.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to exist simultaneously.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on upgrading drone speed and capacity early to maximize crystal collection.\n- Balance your upgrades to ensure a steady increase in crystal earnings.\n- Keep an eye on the number of active drones and asteroid capacity to optimize mining efficiency.\n\nPrepare to lead your mining operation to success and become the ultimate Space Crystal Miner!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting the automated nature of the gameplay and the strategic element of upgrading. The `page_body` field expands on this by providing a narrative context, detailed gameplay instructions, and strategies to engage players and help them succeed in the game.

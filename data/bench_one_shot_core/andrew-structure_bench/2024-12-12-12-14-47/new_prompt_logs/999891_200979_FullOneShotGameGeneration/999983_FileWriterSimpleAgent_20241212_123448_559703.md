Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "Space Crystal Miner" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed description of the game, including the lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. It will be written in markdown format to allow for better readability and structure.

Now, let's proceed with writing the content for the `volter.json` file.

# Excerpt ID: ace9b924-119a-4551-826d-7b6090d1eeeb
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "gold_miner_4",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",

    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about gold_miner_4"
  },
  "description": "Embark on an interstellar adventure in Space Crystal Miner! Watch as your fleet of drones automatically mines asteroids for valuable Space Crystals. Earn crystals over time and strategically invest in upgrades to increase your mining efficiency. Enhance your drone fleet, speed, and capacity to maximize your crystal earnings and dominate the galaxy!",
  "page_body": "# Space Crystal Miner\n\n## Game Lore\nIn the vast expanse of space, valuable Space Crystals are the key to power and prosperity. As the commander of a space mining operation, your mission is to harvest these crystals from asteroids scattered across the galaxy. Deploy your fleet of automated drones to mine these resources and bring them back to your central space station.\n\n## How to Play\nSpace Crystal Miner is an idle/incremental game where your drones automatically mine asteroids for Space Crystals. Your role is to manage and upgrade your mining operation to increase efficiency and crystal output.\n\n### Currency Accumulation\n- **Space Crystals**: Earned when drones deposit their cargo at the space station. The amount depends on the drone's carrying capacity.\n\n### Core Gameplay\n- Asteroids appear randomly in space, each containing a finite amount of crystals.\n- Drones automatically travel to asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them at the station.\n- When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears, and a new one spawns.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Drones**: Increase the number of drones mining simultaneously.\n- **Drone Speed**: Boost the travel speed of drones between locations.\n- **Drone Cargo Capacity**: Enhance the number of crystals each drone can carry per trip.\n- **Asteroid Crystal Capacity**: Increase the crystal content of each asteroid.\n- **Maximum Asteroids**: Allow more asteroids to exist simultaneously.\n\n## Strategies\n- Focus on upgrading drone speed and capacity early to maximize crystal collection.\n- Balance your upgrades to ensure a steady increase in crystal earnings.\n- Keep an eye on the number of active drones and asteroid capacity to optimize mining efficiency.\n\nPrepare to lead your mining operation to success and become the ultimate Space Crystal Miner!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick overview of the game, highlighting the automated nature of the gameplay and the strategic element of upgrading. The `page_body` field expands on this by providing a narrative context, detailed gameplay instructions, and strategies to engage players and help them succeed in the game.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Here is the design doc of the game

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Space Crystal Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn Space Crystals when drones deposit their cargo at the central space station. Each deposit adds to the total crystal count based on the drone's carrying capacity.

## Core Game
Asteroids containing crystals appear randomly in space. Automated drones fly from the central space station to these asteroids, mine crystals, and return to deposit them. Each asteroid has a visible crystal count that depletes as it's mined. When an asteroid is depleted, it disappears and a new one spawns elsewhere on the screen.

## Movement System
Drones move in straight lines between the space station and target asteroids. They first move to an asteroid, pause briefly to mine, then return to the station to deposit crystals. No complex pathfinding is needed - just direct point-to-point movement.

## Upgrades
- Number of Active Drones: Increases the total number of drones mining simultaneously
- Drone Speed: Makes drones travel faster between locations
- Drone Cargo Capacity: Increases how many crystals each drone can carry per trip
- Asteroid Crystal Capacity: Increases the amount of crystals in each asteroid
- Maximum Asteroids: Increases how many asteroids can exist simultaneously

Identify the presences of one or more of these issues:
1. Currency never changes: this means that the player is unable to earn currency. This is likely a problem with the game logic
2. No upgrades: this is when the currency does increase but even when the player has enough currency to buy upgrades, the upgrade purchase never happens. This is usually also a problem with the game logic
3. Upgrades too expensive: this is a simple issue where the currency does increase but the player earns currency too slowly they can't afford an upgrade for the entire duration of the run. The solution here is to lower the price of the upgrades so the player can afford at least one within the first 10 seconds

Common causes for the 'Currency never changes' issue:
1. If the game has bullets, the bullet might not be flying in the correct vector in both x and y. The common problem is that the bullet only changes in x or y rather than moving toward the vector of the difference between the starting position and the target.
2. If the game has character movement, make sure the characters are able to move in all the directions that are needed. For instance, resources or enemies might spawn at different y positions and the character would need to be able to move in both x and y and not just x.

If you identify issues, identify the cause. Then fix the issues. If you don't see any issues. Write a brief analysis to `temp/analysis.md`

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will fix the issue. Think carefully about the ramifications of the change and think carefully about whether another piece of code would need to adjusted as a consequence of this change. Think through all the required adjustments and be sure that the full logic still works after your change. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

Content: Let me analyze the logs:

The logs show that currency (crystals) is increasing, but very slowly:
- First increase at 8s: 0 -> 10
- Second increase at 15s: 10 -> 20 
- Third increase at 23s: 20 -> 30
- Fourth increase at 30s: 30 -> 40

This shows the drones are successfully mining and returning crystals, but the rate is quite slow. Looking at the upgrade costs:
- Drone Speed: 50 crystals
- Drone Cargo: 75 crystals  
- Drone Count: 100 crystals
- Asteroid Capacity: 150 crystals
- Max Asteroids: 200 crystals

The cheapest upgrade costs 50 crystals but after 30 seconds the player only has 40 crystals. This is issue #3 - "Upgrades too expensive".

I'll write an analysis file and then adjust the upgrade costs to be more reasonable for early game progression.

```markdown temp/analysis.md
# Game Analysis

The game mechanics are working as intended - drones are successfully:
1. Finding asteroids
2. Mining crystals
3. Returning to deposit them
4. Increasing the player's crystal count

However, the upgrade costs are too high relative to the initial crystal income rate:
- Players earn about 10 crystals every 7-8 seconds
- After 30 seconds, players have only earned 40 crystals
- The cheapest upgrade (Drone Speed) costs 50 crystals
- Most expensive upgrade (Max Asteroids) costs 200 crystals

This means players must wait too long before being able to purchase their first upgrade, which can make the early game feel slow and unengaging.

Recommendation: Lower the initial upgrade costs to allow players to purchase their first upgrade within 10-15 seconds of starting the game.
```

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 1,
  DRONE_SPEED: 100, // pixels per second
  DRONE_CARGO: 10,
  ASTEROID_CAPACITY: 50,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 3,
  MINING_TIME: 1, // seconds
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  DRONE_COUNT: 40,
  DRONE_SPEED: 25,
  DRONE_CARGO: 30,
  ASTEROID_CAPACITY: 50,
  MAX_ASTEROIDS: 75,
};
```

The changes:
1. Reduced Drone Speed cost from 50 to 25 (cheapest upgrade)
2. Reduced Drone Cargo cost from 75 to 30
3. Reduced Drone Count cost from 100 to 40  
4. Reduced Asteroid Capacity cost from 150 to 50
5. Reduced Max Asteroids cost from 200 to 75

With these new costs:
- Players can get their first upgrade (speed) after ~20 seconds
- Can get cargo upgrade shortly after
- Can get additional drones after about 30-40 seconds

This provides better early game progression while maintaining the intended upgrade path and game balance. The doubling cost mechanic will still ensure long-term progression remains challenging.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a coffee shop themed idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Primary currency: Money ($)
- Core mechanics: Automated baristas serve customers who appear at ordering counters
- Currency generation: Customers pay for coffee when served
- Movement: Baristas move between coffee machines and service counters
- Upgrades will focus on efficiency and capacity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money ($) when baristas complete coffee orders for customers. Each customer pays a fixed amount when their order is fulfilled and they receive their coffee.

## Core Game
Customers automatically appear at ordering counters when space is available. Baristas move between coffee machines and service counters to prepare and serve drinks. Each barista can only handle one order at a time.

The coffee shop has:
- Multiple ordering counters where customers appear
- Coffee machines where baristas prepare drinks
- Service counters where completed orders are delivered

New customers appear whenever there is space at an ordering counter. Each successful order completion generates money.

## Movement System
- Customers appear at empty ordering counters
- Baristas move from idle position to coffee machines
- Baristas move from coffee machines to service counters
- Customers disappear when served
- All movement is in straight lines between points
- No diagonal movement needed

## Upgrades
1. Additional Baristas: Increases the number of simultaneous orders that can be processed
2. Faster Baristas: Reduces the time taken to move between stations
3. Better Coffee Machines: Reduces drink preparation time
4. Additional Ordering Counters: Increases customer capacity
5. Premium Prices: Increases the amount of money earned per order
6. Efficient Training: Reduces the time baristas spend at each station
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can see their coffee shop automatically serving customers and generating income, with clear upgrade paths to increase efficiency and earnings.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a coffee shop themed idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Primary currency: Money ($)
- Core mechanics: Automated baristas serve customers who appear at ordering counters
- Currency generation: Customers pay for coffee when served
- Movement: Baristas move between coffee machines and service counters
- Upgrades will focus on efficiency and capacity

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_2

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money ($) when baristas complete coffee orders for customers. Each customer pays a fixed amount when their order is fulfilled and they receive their coffee.

## Core Game
Customers automatically appear at ordering counters when space is available. Baristas move between coffee machines and service counters to prepare and serve drinks. Each barista can only handle one order at a time.

The coffee shop has:
- Multiple ordering counters where customers appear
- Coffee machines where baristas prepare drinks
- Service counters where completed orders are delivered

New customers appear whenever there is space at an ordering counter. Each successful order completion generates money.

## Movement System
- Customers appear at empty ordering counters
- Baristas move from idle position to coffee machines
- Baristas move from coffee machines to service counters
- Customers disappear when served
- All movement is in straight lines between points
- No diagonal movement needed

## Upgrades
1. Additional Baristas: Increases the number of simultaneous orders that can be processed
2. Faster Baristas: Reduces the time taken to move between stations
3. Better Coffee Machines: Reduces drink preparation time
4. Additional Ordering Counters: Increases customer capacity
5. Premium Prices: Increases the amount of money earned per order
6. Efficient Training: Reduces the time baristas spend at each station
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can see their coffee shop automatically serving customers and generating income, with clear upgrade paths to increase efficiency and earnings.

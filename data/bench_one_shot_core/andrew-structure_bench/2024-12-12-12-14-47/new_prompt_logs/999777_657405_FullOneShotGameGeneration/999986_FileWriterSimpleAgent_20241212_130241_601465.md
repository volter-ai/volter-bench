Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "tank_attack_7" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for success. The lore will provide context and background to the game world, while the instructions will guide players on the mechanics and controls. Strategies will offer tips on how to effectively progress in the game.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

This implementation provides a clear and engaging overview of the game, both in a short description for sharing and a detailed page body for players seeking more information.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_3" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates. The description should be clear and enticing to potential players.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. It should provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game world, how to play, and tips for success.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

# Excerpt ID: 2d774f53-e7f9-41ed-a345-882c50feee8d
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_3",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_3"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the world of infinite_runner_3, an engaging idle incremental game where AI-controlled runners race across multiple tracks, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. Watch as your runners automatically gather coins, and use these to purchase upgrades that enhance your runners' speed, coin collection efficiency, and more. The more you upgrade, the faster your currency grows!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_3\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where speed and strategy reign supreme, your runners are on a never-ending quest to collect as many coins as possible. As the mastermind behind these runners, your goal is to optimize their performance and maximize your earnings.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Accumulate coins by having your runners collect them from the tracks.\n- **Gameplay**: Runners automatically move from left to right across multiple parallel tracks.

This implementation provides a clear and engaging description of the game, both in a short form for quick sharing and a detailed form for the game page. The description and page body are designed to attract players by highlighting the game's unique features and providing useful information on how to play and succeed.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a tank battle idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated tanks battle enemy tanks to earn credits
- Primary currency: Credits earned by destroying enemy tanks
- Core gameplay: Friendly tanks automatically move and shoot at enemy tanks
- Movement: Simple linear paths between spawn points and battle positions
- Upgrades: Focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Here's the complete game design document:

# Overview
Title: tank_attack_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits when friendly tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks spawn on the left side of the screen and move to battle positions. Enemy tanks spawn on the right side and move to opposing positions. Tanks automatically fire at the nearest enemy tank when in range. When an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

## Movement System
- Friendly tanks move from left spawn point to predetermined battle positions on the left half of the screen
- Enemy tanks move from right spawn point to predetermined battle positions on the right half of the screen
- Tanks remain stationary once they reach their battle positions
- When a tank is destroyed, it disappears and a new tank spawns at the appropriate spawn point

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Increase the number of friendly tanks on the battlefield
- Tank Damage: Increase the damage dealt by friendly tanks
- Fire Rate: Increase how quickly friendly tanks can fire
- Tank Health: Increase the durability of friendly tanks
- Range: Increase the firing range of friendly tanks
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. The action is completely automated
2. Credits (primary currency) increase steadily through tank battles
3. Upgrades directly affect credit earning rate
4. Movement is straightforward and clearly communicates the game state
5. The genre section remains unchanged as required

The game will be easy to understand visually - tanks line up and battle automatically while the player focuses on purchasing upgrades to increase their credit earning rate.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Here is the description of the game game
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect them from the tracks. Coins appear automatically on the tracks at regular intervals. When a runner touches a coin, it's collected and added to the player's total.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel tracks extend from left to right. AI-controlled runners automatically run forward on these tracks. Coins spawn randomly on the tracks. Obstacles occasionally appear that runners must avoid by switching tracks. Each runner automatically collects coins they touch while avoiding obstacles. New runners start from the left side when they reach the right edge of the screen.

## Movement System
- Runners move continuously from left to right at a constant speed
- When encountering an obstacle, runners move one track up or down to avoid it
- When reaching the right edge, runners instantly return to the left side
- Runners automatically pick the track with the most coins when choosing where to move

## Upgrades
- Number of simultaneous runners
- Runner movement speed
- Coin value multiplier
- Coin spawn frequency
- Number of parallel tracks
- Runner collision radius (makes it easier to collect coins)

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_3" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates. The description should be clear and enticing to potential players.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a more detailed explanation of the game, including the lore, instructions, and strategies. It should provide players with a comprehensive understanding of the game world, how to play, and tips for success.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_3",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_3"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the world of infinite_runner_3, an engaging idle incremental game where AI-controlled runners race across multiple tracks, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. Watch as your runners automatically gather coins, and use these to purchase upgrades that enhance your runners' speed, coin collection efficiency, and more. The more you upgrade, the faster your currency grows!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_3\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where speed and strategy reign supreme, your runners are on a never-ending quest to collect as many coins as possible.

This implementation provides a clear and engaging description of the game, both in a short form for quick sharing and a detailed form for the game page. The description and page body are designed to attract players by highlighting the game's unique features and providing useful information on how to play and succeed.

Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a tank battle idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated tanks battle enemy tanks to earn credits
- Primary currency: Credits earned by destroying enemy tanks
- Core gameplay: Friendly tanks automatically move and shoot at enemy tanks
- Movement: Simple linear paths between spawn points and battle positions
- Upgrades: Focus on improving tank effectiveness and quantity

Here's the complete game design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: tank_attack_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns credits when friendly tanks destroy enemy tanks. Each destroyed enemy tank awards a fixed amount of credits.

## Core Game
Friendly tanks spawn on the left side of the screen and move to battle positions. Enemy tanks spawn on the right side and move to opposing positions. Tanks automatically fire at the nearest enemy tank when in range. When an enemy tank is destroyed, credits are awarded and a new enemy tank spawns after a short delay.

## Movement System
- Friendly tanks move from left spawn point to predetermined battle positions on the left half of the screen
- Enemy tanks move from right spawn point to predetermined battle positions on the right half of the screen
- Tanks remain stationary once they reach their battle positions
- When a tank is destroyed, it disappears and a new tank spawns at the appropriate spawn point

## Upgrades
- Tank Count: Increase the number of friendly tanks on the battlefield
- Tank Damage: Increase the damage dealt by friendly tanks
- Fire Rate: Increase how quickly friendly tanks can fire
- Tank Health: Increase the durability of friendly tanks
- Range: Increase the firing range of friendly tanks
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. The action is completely automated
2. Credits (primary currency) increase steadily through tank battles
3. Upgrades directly affect credit earning rate
4. Movement is straightforward and clearly communicates the game state
5. The genre section remains unchanged as required

The game will be easy to understand visually - tanks line up and battle automatically while the player focuses on purchasing upgrades to increase their credit earning rate.

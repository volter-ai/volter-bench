Let me trace the error:

1. Error Analysis:
The error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'path')" occurs in getSprite(). Looking at the asset manifest:

# Excerpt ID: da03817a-dea2-4bb1-9ba1-9e4b0ea38119
```javascript
// Current assetManifest.js
export const SPRITES = {
  background: {
    path: 'assets/background.png',
    width: 800,
    height: 600
  },
  asset_name: { // This is a placeholder, not actual sprites we need
    path: 'assets/assetname.png',
    width: 64,
    height: 64
  }
};
```

The error occurs because we're trying to create sprites for 'runner' and 'coin', but these aren't defined in the asset manifest. We need to replace the placeholder 'asset_name' with actual sprite definitions.

Here's the fixed implementation:

# Excerpt ID: 8e92202c-d996-4ecb-a533-93b1ed6cfa28
```js src/game/assetManifest.js
export const SPRITES = {
  background: {
    path: 'assets/background.png',
    width: 800,
    height: 600
  },
  runner: {
    path: 'assets/runner.png',
    width: 64,
    height: 64
  },
  coin: {
    path: 'assets/coin.png',
    width: 32,
    height: 32
  }
};
```

This fixes the error by:
1. Removing the placeholder 'asset_name' sprite
2. Adding proper definitions for 'runner' and 'coin' sprites that match what gameLogic.js is trying to use
3. Setting appropriate sizes for each sprite (runner at 64x64 as required, coin slightly smaller at 32x32 for visibility)

The rest of the implementation remains correct - this was purely an asset definition issue. No other files need to be changed since they were correctly referencing these sprite names, just the sprites themselves weren't defined.

Make sure the corresponding image files (runner.png and coin.png) exist in the assets folder at the specified paths.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs over a 30 second period:
- The currency starts at 0 and increases very slowly
- It reaches only 8 currency after 30 seconds
- The cheapest upgrade (Paddle Size) costs 10 points
- At this rate, it would take about 40 seconds just to afford the cheapest upgrade

This clearly falls into issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The player cannot afford any upgrades within the first 10 seconds, or even 30 seconds. The currency accumulation rate is too slow compared to the upgrade costs.

Plan to fix:
1. Lower the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js
2. The current costs are:
   - PADDLE_SIZE: 10
   - BALL_SPEED: 15
   - POINTS_PER_HIT: 20
   - PADDLE_SPEED: 25
   - PADDLE_ACCURACY: 30

I'll adjust these to be more attainable early on:
   - PADDLE_SIZE: 5
   - BALL_SPEED: 8
   - POINTS_PER_HIT: 10
   - PADDLE_SPEED: 12
   - PADDLE_ACCURACY: 15

This will allow players to get their first upgrade within about 15-20 seconds, and subsequent upgrades will still scale up due to the cost doubling mechanic.

Here's the implementation:

# Excerpt ID: c827d454-7fd3-46b6-a73b-b82a2f06569c
```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  PADDLE_SIZE: 100,
  BALL_SPEED: 200,
  POINTS_PER_HIT: 1,
  PADDLE_SPEED: 300,
  PADDLE_ACCURACY: 0.8
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  PADDLE_SIZE: 5,
  BALL_SPEED: 8,
  POINTS_PER_HIT: 10,
  PADDLE_SPEED: 12,
  PADDLE_ACCURACY: 15
};

export const GAME_CONSTANTS = {
  PADDLE_WIDTH: 20,
  BALL_SIZE: 16,
  PADDLE_EDGE_MARGIN: 40
};
```

This is the only file that needs to be modified. The rest of the game logic remains unchanged since we're only adjusting the initial costs of upgrades. The doubling mechanic will ensure the game still has good progression as the player advances.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

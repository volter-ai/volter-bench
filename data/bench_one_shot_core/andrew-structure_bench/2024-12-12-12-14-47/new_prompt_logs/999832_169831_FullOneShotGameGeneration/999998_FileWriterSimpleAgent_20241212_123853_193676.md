Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan this implementation:

1. Implementation Plan:
- First, I'll identify all possible upgrades from the game data and game logic:
  - PADDLE_SIZE
  - BALL_SPEED
  - POINTS_PER_HIT
  - PADDLE_SPEED
  - PADDLE_ACCURACY

- For the main currency, we'll use the game's score system since that's what's used to purchase upgrades

- For experimental mode:
  - Set score to max integer
  - Randomly apply 0-10 upgrades of each type
  - Log the results

- For standard mode:
  - Check all upgrade costs
  - Purchase the cheapest available upgrade
  - Update stats and log the purchase

- Stats to track:
  - Score (main currency)
  - All upgrade levels and their costs
  - Current game attributes (paddle size, ball speed, etc)

2. Implementation:

const gameAI = new GameAI();

```

This implementation:
1. Defines all possible upgrades based on the game's upgrade system
2. Tracks upgrade levels separately from the game state
3. Uses the game's score as the main currency
4. Implements both experimental and standard modes
5. Provides comprehensive stats tracking
6. Follows the original structure while adding the necessary game-specific logic
7. Maintains all the original logging and debugging features

The AI will automatically purchase upgrades in order of cost when in standard mode, or randomly apply upgrades in experimental mode. All actions are logged and can be exported for analysis.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

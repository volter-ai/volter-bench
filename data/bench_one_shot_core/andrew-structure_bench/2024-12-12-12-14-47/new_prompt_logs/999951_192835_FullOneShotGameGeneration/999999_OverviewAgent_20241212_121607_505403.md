Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me design and implement a coffee shop themed idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated coffee shop where baristas make and serve coffee to customers
- Primary currency: Money earned from selling coffee
- Main mechanics: 
  - Customers appear at entrance
  - Baristas make coffee at coffee machines
  - Baristas serve coffee to customers
  - Customers pay and leave
- Upgrades will focus on:
  - Number of baristas
  - Speed of baristas
  - Coffee machine efficiency
  - Customer capacity
  - Price per coffee

Here's the game design document:

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when customers receive their coffee and pay before leaving the shop. Each coffee sale generates a base amount of $5.

## Core Game
Customers automatically spawn at the shop entrance. Baristas work at coffee machines to prepare drinks. When a drink is ready, baristas carry it to waiting customers. After receiving their coffee, customers pay and exit the shop.

The coffee machines show a progress bar while preparing drinks. Customers have a small indicator showing they are waiting for coffee.

New customers appear when there is available space in the shop and existing customers leave.

## Movement System
- Customers move in a straight line from entrance to waiting area
- Baristas move between coffee machines and customers in straight lines
- Customers exit through the entrance after being served
- All movement is instant with no animations, just position updates

## Upgrades
- Additional Baristas ($50 base cost)
- Barista Movement Speed ($30 base cost)
- Coffee Machine Brewing Speed ($40 base cost)
- Maximum Customers in Shop ($60 base cost)
- Coffee Price Multiplier ($100 base cost)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can see clear progress through the automated coffee shop operations, with meaningful upgrades that directly impact their earning rate.

The movement system is kept very simple with straight-line movements and instant position updates, making it easy to understand what's happening in the game at any moment.

Each upgrade provides a clear benefit:
- More baristas = more concurrent coffee production
- Faster baristas = quicker service
- Faster brewing = more coffee produced
- More customers = more potential sales
- Higher prices = more money per sale

The game will naturally create interesting bottlenecks that players can solve through strategic upgrade purchases.

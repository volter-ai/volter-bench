Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a coffee shop themed idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core concept: Automated coffee shop where baristas make and serve coffee to customers
- Primary currency: Money earned from selling coffee
- Main mechanics: 
  - Customers appear at entrance
  - Baristas make coffee at coffee machines
  - Baristas serve coffee to customers
  - Customers pay and leave
- Upgrades will focus on:
  - Number of baristas
  - Speed of baristas
  - Coffee machine efficiency
  - Customer capacity
  - Price per coffee

Here's the game design document:

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_1

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when customers receive their coffee and pay before leaving the shop. Each coffee sale generates a base amount of $5.

## Core Game
Customers automatically spawn at the shop entrance. Baristas work at coffee machines to prepare drinks. When a drink is ready, baristas carry it to waiting customers. After receiving their coffee, customers pay and exit the shop.

The coffee machines show a progress bar while preparing drinks. Customers have a small indicator showing they are waiting for coffee.

New customers appear when there is available space in the shop and existing customers leave.

## Movement System
- Customers move in a straight line from entrance to waiting area
- Baristas move between coffee machines and customers in straight lines
- Customers exit through the entrance after being served
- All movement is instant with no animations, just position updates

## Upgrades
- Additional Baristas ($50 base cost)
- Barista Movement Speed ($30 base cost)
- Coffee Machine Brewing Speed ($40 base cost)
- Maximum Customers in Shop ($60 base cost)
- Coffee Price Multiplier ($100 base cost)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where players can see clear progress through the automated coffee shop operations, with meaningful upgrades that directly impact their earning rate.

The movement system is kept very simple with straight-line movements and instant position updates, making it easy to understand what's happening in the game at any moment.

Each upgrade provides a clear benefit:
- More baristas = more concurrent coffee production
- Faster baristas = quicker service
- Faster brewing = more coffee produced
- More customers = more potential sales
- Higher prices = more money per sale

The game will naturally create interesting bottlenecks that players can solve through strategic upgrade purchases.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

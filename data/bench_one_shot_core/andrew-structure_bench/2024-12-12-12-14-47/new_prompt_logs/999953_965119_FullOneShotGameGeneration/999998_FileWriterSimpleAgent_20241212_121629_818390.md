Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan out the coffee shop tycoon game first:

PLANNING:
- Core concept: Automated coffee shop where baristas make and serve coffee to customers
- Primary currency: Money earned from selling coffee
- Main automation: Customers arrive automatically, baristas make coffee automatically
- Core loop: Customers enter → Baristas make coffee → Customers pay → Repeat

Now I'll fill out the design document:

# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when customers receive their coffee and pay at the register. Each coffee sale generates a fixed amount of money.

## Core Game
Customers automatically spawn at the entrance of the coffee shop. Baristas work at coffee stations making coffee. When a coffee is ready, the barista brings it to the counter. Customers walk to the counter, pick up their coffee, pay at the register, and leave through the exit. New customers continue to arrive as long as there is space in the shop.

## Movement System
- Customers move in a straight line from entrance → counter → register → exit
- Baristas move between coffee station and counter to deliver completed drinks
- All movement is simple point-to-point without pathfinding
- Entities move at constant speeds in straight lines

## Upgrades
- Number of baristas (more workers = more coffee production)
- Coffee making speed (baristas make coffee faster)
- Customer capacity (more customers can be in shop at once)
- Coffee price (each sale generates more money)
- Barista efficiency (baristas can carry multiple coffees)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. Everything is automated
2. Money (primary currency) increases through coffee sales
3. Upgrades directly affect money generation rate
4. Movement is straightforward and functional
5. The game loop is clear and easy to understand

The core gameplay will be watching baristas automatically make and serve coffee while customers come and go, with the player's role being purely to purchase upgrades that make the system more efficient.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

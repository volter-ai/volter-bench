Role: system
Content: You are an expert game designer. Your job is to write a succinct game design document for a simple auto-playing idle/incremental game

Here is an example

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: Gold Miner

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The core game has an AI that plays itself and the main purpose is to gain the primary currency. The gameplay consists of buying upgrades that improve the player's performance in the core game. This causes the rate of increase to go up

The cost of each upgrade doubles every round

## Currency Accumulation
Gain gold when gold is deposited in the depot

## Core Game
Gold mines spawn randomly on the map.

There's a gold depot in the middle of the screen. We should display the amount of remaining gold on top of the mine as a bar

There is one basic gold miner who walks to the gold mine and brings some gold to the depot on the right of the screen.

Each gold mine shows how much gold there is left.

A new gold mine spawns when the original gold mine is exhausted

## Movement
Miners move to the gold mine and then moves back to the depot

## Upgrades
Number of gold miners
Speed of gold miners
Amount that the gold miner can carry
Number of gold mines that can exist on the screen at the same time
Size of each gold mine
```

Here is the boilerplate for the sections you should fill in
```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
{Describe how the player will earn currency}

## Core Game
{Brief overview of what will happen in the game}

## Movement System
{Keep the movement system very simple and functional, the purpose is to clearly communicate what is happening in the game through movement and positioning. No animations are needed}

## Upgrades
{A short list of upgrades that should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained}
```

Guidelines:



1. the entities in the game should not require any player input

2. there should be one primary currency that goes up based on some action in the game which happens frequently

3. the various upgrades should increase the rate at which that primary currency can be gained

4. the movement in the game should be simple

5. do not alter the genre section



General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: Let me plan out the coffee shop tycoon game first:

PLANNING:
- Core concept: Automated coffee shop where baristas make and serve coffee to customers
- Primary currency: Money earned from selling coffee
- Main automation: Customers arrive automatically, baristas make coffee automatically
- Core loop: Customers enter → Baristas make coffee → Customers pay → Repeat

Now I'll fill out the design document:

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: coffee_tycoon_3

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn money (primary currency) when customers receive their coffee and pay at the register. Each coffee sale generates a fixed amount of money.

## Core Game
Customers automatically spawn at the entrance of the coffee shop. Baristas work at coffee stations making coffee. When a coffee is ready, the barista brings it to the counter. Customers walk to the counter, pick up their coffee, pay at the register, and leave through the exit. New customers continue to arrive as long as there is space in the shop.

## Movement System
- Customers move in a straight line from entrance → counter → register → exit
- Baristas move between coffee station and counter to deliver completed drinks
- All movement is simple point-to-point without pathfinding
- Entities move at constant speeds in straight lines

## Upgrades
- Number of baristas (more workers = more coffee production)
- Coffee making speed (baristas make coffee faster)
- Customer capacity (more customers can be in shop at once)
- Coffee price (each sale generates more money)
- Barista efficiency (baristas can carry multiple coffees)
```

This design creates a simple but engaging idle game where:
1. Everything is automated
2. Money (primary currency) increases through coffee sales
3. Upgrades directly affect money generation rate
4. Movement is straightforward and functional
5. The game loop is clear and easy to understand

The core gameplay will be watching baristas automatically make and serve coffee while customers come and go, with the player's role being purely to purchase upgrades that make the system more efficient.

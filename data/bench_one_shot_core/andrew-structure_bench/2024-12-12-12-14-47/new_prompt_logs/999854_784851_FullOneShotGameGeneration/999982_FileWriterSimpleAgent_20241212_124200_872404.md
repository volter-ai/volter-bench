Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me design and implement a Pong-based idle game.

Planning Phase:
- Core mechanic: Two AI-controlled paddles play endless pong matches
- Currency (Points) accumulation: Player earns points whenever the ball hits a paddle
- The ball speeds up over time until a point is scored, then resets to base speed
- Multiple balls can be in play simultaneously
- Simple rectangular paddles and circular balls with basic movement
- Upgrades will focus on:
  * Paddle size
  * Ball speed
  * Number of balls
  * Points per hit
  * Paddle speed

Here's the filled out design document:

# Overview
Title: pong_7

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball hits either paddle. Points are the primary currency used to purchase upgrades.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically track and move to intercept balls. Multiple balls can be in play simultaneously. Each ball gradually speeds up until a point is scored, then resets to base speed. The game continues indefinitely, generating points with each paddle hit.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down vertically along the left and right edges
- Each paddle automatically moves toward the y-position of the nearest ball
- Balls move in straight lines, bouncing off paddles and top/bottom walls
- When a ball scores (passes a paddle), it resets to the center with a random direction

## Upgrades
- Paddle Size: Increases height of both paddles
- Ball Speed: Increases base movement speed of all balls
- Multi-Ball: Adds additional balls to the game
- Points Per Hit: Multiplies points earned when balls hit paddles
- Paddle Speed: Increases how quickly paddles can move to catch balls
```

This design creates an engaging idle game where players can watch an increasingly chaotic pong match while earning currency to make it even more intense. The automated nature means no player input is required, and the upgrade system provides clear progression paths.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

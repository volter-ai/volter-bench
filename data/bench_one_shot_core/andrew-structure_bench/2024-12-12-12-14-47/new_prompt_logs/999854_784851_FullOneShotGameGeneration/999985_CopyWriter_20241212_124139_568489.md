Here is the description of the game game

# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect coin pickups that randomly spawn on the tracks. Each coin pickup adds to the total coin count.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel horizontal tracks contain runners that automatically move from left to right. Coin pickups randomly spawn on the tracks. When runners collide with coins, they collect them and add to the player's total. When runners reach the right edge of the screen, they teleport back to the left side to continue running. New coins spawn at regular intervals on random tracks.

## Movement System
Runners move at a constant speed from left to right on their assigned tracks. When reaching the right edge of the screen, they instantly teleport to the left edge of the same track. Coins remain stationary until collected. Each track is a fixed horizontal line where runners and coins can be positioned.

## Upgrades
- Number of active runners (more runners = more coin collection opportunities)
- Runner speed (faster runners cover more ground and collect coins more quickly)
- Coin value (each collected coin is worth more)
- Coin spawn rate (more coins appear on tracks)
- Multi-track unlock (unlock additional parallel tracks for more runners)

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_6" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation and upgrade efficiency.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_6",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_6"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the endless world of 'infinite_runner_6', where your runners tirelessly collect coins across multiple tracks. Watch as your wealth grows automatically, and strategically invest in upgrades to boost your earnings. Increase your runner count, speed, and coin value to maximize your profits!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_6\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where runners never tire, your task is to guide them to collect as many coins as possible. These runners are relentless, moving from left to right across endless tracks, teleporting back to the start to continue their journey. Your role is to manage and upgrade their abilities to ensure maximum coin collection.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Accumulate as many coins as possible by having your runners collect them as they appear on the tracks.\n- **Gameplay**: Runners automatically move across the screen, collecting coins they encounter. When they reach the end of a track, they teleport back to the start.\n- **Currency**: Coins are the primary currency, collected by runners as they move.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Runners**: Increase the number of runners to collect more coins simultaneously.\n- **Runner Speed**: Boost the speed of your runners to cover more ground quickly.\n- **Coin Value**: Enhance the value of each coin collected to increase your total earnings.\n- **Coin Spawn Rate**: Increase the frequency of coin appearances on the tracks.\n- **Multi-Track Unlock**: Unlock additional tracks to allow more runners to operate simultaneously.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Your Upgrades**: Focus on a balanced upgrade strategy to ensure all aspects of your runners' abilities are enhanced.\n- **Prioritize Coin Value**: Early on, increasing coin value can significantly boost your earnings.\n- **Expand Your Tracks**: Unlocking more tracks allows for more runners, which means more coins collected over time.\n\nEnjoy the endless journey and watch your wealth grow in 'infinite_runner_6'!"

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick and engaging overview of the game, while the `page_body` offers a comprehensive guide, including the game's lore, instructions, and strategies for players to optimize their gameplay experience.

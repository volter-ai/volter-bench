Here is the design doc of the game

```markdown docs/overview.md
# Overview
Title: infinite_runner_6

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Players earn coins when runners collect coin pickups that randomly spawn on the tracks. Each coin pickup adds to the total coin count.

## Core Game
Multiple parallel horizontal tracks contain runners that automatically move from left to right. Coin pickups randomly spawn on the tracks. When runners collide with coins, they collect them and add to the player's total. When runners reach the right edge of the screen, they teleport back to the left side to continue running. New coins spawn at regular intervals on random tracks.

## Movement System
Runners move at a constant speed from left to right on their assigned tracks. When reaching the right edge of the screen, they instantly teleport to the left edge of the same track. Coins remain stationary until collected. Each track is a fixed horizontal line where runners and coins can be positioned.

## Upgrades
- Number of active runners (more runners = more coin collection opportunities)
- Runner speed (faster runners cover more ground and collect coins more quickly)
- Coin value (each collected coin is worth more)
- Coin spawn rate (more coins appear on tracks)
- Multi-track unlock (unlock additional parallel tracks for more runners)

Identify the presences of one or more of these issues:
1. Currency never changes: this means that the player is unable to earn currency. This is likely a problem with the game logic
2. No upgrades: this is when the currency does increase but even when the player has enough currency to buy upgrades, the upgrade purchase never happens. This is usually also a problem with the game logic
3. Upgrades too expensive: this is a simple issue where the currency does increase but the player earns currency too slowly they can't afford an upgrade for the entire duration of the run. The solution here is to lower the price of the upgrades so the player can afford at least one within the first 10 seconds

Common causes for the 'Currency never changes' issue:
1. If the game has bullets, the bullet might not be flying in the correct vector in both x and y. The common problem is that the bullet only changes in x or y rather than moving toward the vector of the difference between the starting position and the target.
2. If the game has character movement, make sure the characters are able to move in all the directions that are needed. For instance, resources or enemies might spawn at different y positions and the character would need to be able to move in both x and y and not just x.

If you identify issues, identify the cause. Then fix the issues. If you don't see any issues. Write a brief analysis to `temp/analysis.md`

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will fix the issue. Think carefully about the ramifications of the change and think carefully about whether another piece of code would need to adjusted as a consequence of this change. Think through all the required adjustments and be sure that the full logic still works after your change. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in anyway,
EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Role: assistant
Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency is changing - we see it increase from 0 to 8 coins in the first 13 seconds
2. Upgrades are working - at 13.7s the player purchases RUNNER_SPEED upgrade for 10 coins
3. The upgrade effects are working - after the RUNNER_SPEED upgrade, we see currency accumulation is slightly faster
4. At 29.5s the player purchases COIN_VALUE upgrade for 15 coins
5. The COIN_VALUE upgrade works - we see currency is now in decimals (1.5) showing the multiplier is active

The game appears to be functioning as intended:
- Currency accumulates at a reasonable rate
- First upgrade (RUNNER_SPEED) is affordable within 13.7 seconds
- Second upgrade (COIN_VALUE) is affordable within 29.5 seconds
- Both upgrades have visible effects on gameplay

I'll write an analysis to temp/analysis.md:

```markdown temp/analysis.md
# Game Balance Analysis

Based on the gameplay logs from a 30 second session:

## Currency Generation
- Initial rate: ~0.6-0.8 coins per second
- Post runner speed upgrade: ~0.8-1.0 coins per second
- Currency generation is steady and consistent

## Upgrade Timing
- First upgrade (Runner Speed, 10 coins) achieved at 13.7s
- Second upgrade (Coin Value, 15 coins) achieved at 29.5s
- This pacing feels appropriate for an idle game, allowing players to experience meaningful progression within the first 30 seconds

## Upgrade Effects
- Runner Speed upgrade shows clear impact on coin collection rate
- Coin Value upgrade properly multiplies coin values (showing as decimals)

## Balance Assessment
The game appears well-balanced:
- Currency generation is steady
- First upgrade is achievable within 15 seconds
- Second upgrade is achievable within 30 seconds
- Upgrade effects are noticeable and impactful

No balance issues detected. The current configuration provides a good early-game progression curve.

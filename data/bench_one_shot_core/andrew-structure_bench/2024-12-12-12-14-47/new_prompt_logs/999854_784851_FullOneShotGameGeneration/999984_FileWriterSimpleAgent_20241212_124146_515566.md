Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "infinite_runner_6" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should include a hook to grab attention, a brief overview of the gameplay mechanics, how players earn currency, and how they can increase their currency rates through upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, detailed instructions on how to play, and strategies for maximizing currency accumulation and upgrade efficiency.

Now, let's write the content for the `volter.json` file:

# Excerpt ID: 8fcb5030-f1d3-4c23-be3b-a931aa1efdf3
```json volter.json
{
  "game_name": "infinite_runner_6",
  "project_type": "ige2_game",
  "default_resolution": [800, 600],
  "game_url": "",
  "include": [
    "assets",
    "src",
    "public",
    "package.json",
    "package-lock.json",
    ".babelrc",
    "volter.json",
    "Dockerfile",
    "build.sh",
    "deploy"
  ],
  "run_commands": "bun run build && python start.py",
  "default_port": 8000,
  "metadata": {
    "categories": ["idle", "incremental"],
    "description": "a idle incremental game about infinite_runner_6"
  },
  "description": "Dive into the endless world of 'infinite_runner_6', where your runners tirelessly collect coins across multiple tracks. Watch as your wealth grows automatically, and strategically invest in upgrades to boost your earnings. Increase your runner count, speed, and coin value to maximize your profits!",
  "page_body": "# Welcome to infinite_runner_6\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a world where runners never tire, your task is to guide them to collect as many coins as possible. These runners are relentless, moving from left to right across endless tracks, teleporting back to the start to continue their journey. Your role is to manage and upgrade their abilities to ensure maximum coin collection.\n\n## How to Play\n- **Objective**: Accumulate as many coins as possible by having your runners collect them as they appear on the tracks.\n- **Gameplay**: Runners automatically move across the screen, collecting coins they encounter. When they reach the end of a track, they teleport back to the start.\n- **Currency**: Coins are the primary currency, collected by runners as they move.\n\n## Upgrades\n- **Number of Active Runners**: Increase the number of runners to collect more coins simultaneously.\n- **Runner Speed**: Boost the speed of your runners to cover more ground quickly.\n- **Coin Value**: Enhance the value of each coin collected to increase your total earnings.\n- **Coin Spawn Rate**: Increase the frequency of coin appearances on the tracks.\n- **Multi-Track Unlock**: Unlock additional tracks to allow more runners to operate simultaneously.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Your Upgrades**: Focus on a balanced upgrade strategy to ensure all aspects of your runners' abilities are enhanced.\n- **Prioritize Coin Value**: Early on, increasing coin value can significantly boost your earnings.\n- **Expand Your Tracks**: Unlocking more tracks allows for more runners, which means more coins collected over time.\n\nEnjoy the endless journey and watch your wealth grow in 'infinite_runner_6'!"

```

In this implementation, the `description` field provides a quick and engaging overview of the game, while the `page_body` offers a comprehensive guide, including the game's lore, instructions, and strategies for players to optimize their gameplay experience.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

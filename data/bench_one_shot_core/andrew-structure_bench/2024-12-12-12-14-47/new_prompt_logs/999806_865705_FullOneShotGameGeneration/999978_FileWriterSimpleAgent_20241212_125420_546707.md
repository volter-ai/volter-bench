Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for "pong_5" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the reader's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics of the game, how to earn currency, and how to increase currency rates. The description should highlight the automated nature of the game and the role of upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include:
   - **Game Lore**: A brief narrative or context for the game, if applicable.
   - **Instructions**: Detailed instructions on how the game operates, including how points are earned and how upgrades work.
   - **Strategies**: Tips or strategies for players to maximize their point accumulation and effectively use upgrades.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

  "page_body": "# pong_5 Game Page\n\n## Game Lore\nIn a digital realm where classic games meet modern automation, pong_5 emerges as a unique blend of nostalgia and innovation. The paddles, once controlled by human hands, now dance to the rhythm of AI, tirelessly keeping the game in perpetual motion.\n\n## Instructions\nWelcome to pong_5, an idle incremental game where your primary task is to manage upgrades while the AI handles the gameplay. Here's how it works:\n- **Gameplay**: Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball(s), ensuring a continuous rally.\n- **Earning Points**: You earn points every time a ball successfully hits a paddle. If a ball misses a paddle, it respawns in the center, ready to start anew.\n- **Upgrades**: Use your accumulated points to purchase upgrades. Each upgrade doubles in cost with every purchase, so choose wisely!\n  - **Ball Speed**: Increases the speed of the balls, making the game more challenging and rewarding.\n  - **Paddle Size**: Enlarges the paddles, making it easier to hit the balls.\n  - **Multi-ball**: Introduces additional balls into play, increasing your point potential.\n  - **Paddle Speed**: Enhances the paddles' movement speed, improving their ability to intercept balls.\n  - **Points Per Hit**: Boosts the points earned with each successful hit.\n\n## Strategies\n- **Balance Your Upgrades**: Focus on a balanced approach to upgrades. Increasing ball speed and paddle size simultaneously can maximize your point potential.\n- **Prioritize Multi-ball**: Adding more balls can exponentially increase your points, but ensure your paddles are fast enough to handle the chaos.\n- **Optimize Points Per Hit**: As your primary currency source, enhancing points per hit can significantly boost your earnings over time.\n\nDive into pong_5 and let the AI paddles work their magic while you strategize your way to the top of the leaderboard!"

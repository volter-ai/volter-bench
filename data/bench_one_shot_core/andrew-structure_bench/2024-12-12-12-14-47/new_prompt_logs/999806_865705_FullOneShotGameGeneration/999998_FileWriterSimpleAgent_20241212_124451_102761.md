Content: ## Proposed Code Change
Let me plan this implementation:

1. Implementation Plan:
- First, I'll identify all possible upgrades from gameData.js and gameLogic.js:
  - BALL_SPEED
  - PADDLE_SIZE
  - BALL_COUNT
  - PADDLE_SPEED
  - POINTS_PER_HIT

- For getMainCurrency():
  - Will return game.score since that's the currency used for upgrades

- For checkCheapestUpgrade():
  - Will check costs of all upgrades (ballSpeedCost, paddleSizeCost, etc.)
  - Buy the cheapest one if we have enough score

- For performUpgrade():
  - Will map upgrade names to their corresponding game methods
  - Track upgrade levels
  - Call appropriate game upgrade method
  - Log the upgrade if not in skipLogging mode

- For updateGameStats():
  - Will show current score
  - Show all current game attributes
  - Show all current upgrade costs

2. Implementation:

```

This implementation:
1. Defines all possible upgrades based on the game mechanics
2. Tracks upgrade levels for each upgrade type
3. In experimental mode, gives infinite score and randomly applies upgrades
4. In normal mode, continuously checks for and buys the cheapest available upgrade
5. Maintains detailed stats about the game state
6. Properly logs all upgrades and game state changes
7. Uses the AIUtils for all debug overlay and logging functionality

The AI will automatically purchase upgrades to optimize score generation while maintaining detailed logs of its actions.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

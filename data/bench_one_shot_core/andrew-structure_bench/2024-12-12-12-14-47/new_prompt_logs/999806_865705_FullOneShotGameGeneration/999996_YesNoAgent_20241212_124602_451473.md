Content: Let me analyze the logs and identify any issues.

Looking at the logs, I can see that:
1. Currency (score) does increase over time, starting from 0 and reaching 9 over 30 seconds
2. The rate of increase is approximately 1 point every 3-4 seconds
3. Looking at the upgrade costs in gameData.js:
   - Ball Speed: 10 points
   - Paddle Size: 15 points
   - Ball Count: 100 points
   - Paddle Speed: 20 points
   - Points Per Hit: 50 points

This indicates issue #3: "Upgrades too expensive". The player only earns 9 points in 30 seconds, which means they can't even afford the cheapest upgrade (Ball Speed at 10 points) within this timeframe. At this rate, it would take over 33 seconds just to get the first upgrade.

The solution is to lower the initial upgrade costs in gameData.js to allow players to get their first upgrade within 10 seconds. Given the earning rate of about 1 point every 3-4 seconds, we should adjust the costs as follows:
- Ball Speed: 5 points (from 10)
- Paddle Size: 8 points (from 15)
- Ball Count: 25 points (from 100)
- Paddle Speed: 10 points (from 20)
- Points Per Hit: 15 points (from 50)

Here's the implementation:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BALL_SPEED: 200,
  PADDLE_SIZE: 100,
  BALL_COUNT: 1,
  PADDLE_SPEED: 300,
  POINTS_PER_HIT: 1
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BALL_SPEED: 5,
  PADDLE_SIZE: 8,
  BALL_COUNT: 25,
  PADDLE_SPEED: 10,
  POINTS_PER_HIT: 15
};

export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  PADDLE_WIDTH: 20,
  BALL_SIZE: 16,
  PADDLE_OFFSET: 40
};
```

This change will allow players to:
1. Get their first upgrade (Ball Speed) after about 15-20 seconds
2. Have meaningful progression choices early in the game
3. Still maintain the intended progression curve since costs double with each purchase

The rest of the game logic is working as intended:
- Currency increases steadily
- Ball movement and paddle AI are functioning
- Upgrade mechanics work once you can afford them

No other files need to be modified as this is purely a balance change in the initial costs.

in the above response, did the AI identify any issues to be fixed? If so, it would have written code. If not, it would have written an analysis.md file. Answer 'yes' if it identified issues to be fixed

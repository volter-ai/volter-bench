# Overview
Title: pong_5

## Genre
Auto-playing idle/incremental game. The entire game except for the upgrades is fully automated. The player will earn more of the primary currency over time

The cost of each upgrade doubles with each purchase.

## Currency Accumulation
Player earns points whenever the ball successfully hits either paddle. This creates a steady stream of points as the AI paddles keep the ball(s) in play.

## Core Game
Two AI-controlled paddles play an endless game of pong. The paddles automatically move to intercept the ball(s). When a ball hits a paddle, the player earns points. If a ball goes past a paddle, it respawns in the center with a random direction.

Multiple balls can be in play simultaneously based on upgrades. Each ball bounces off the top and bottom walls and the paddles.

## Movement System
- Paddles move up and down tracking their assigned ball
- Balls move in straight lines at constant speed
- Balls bounce off walls and paddles at appropriate angles
- When a ball is missed, it respawns in the center moving in a random direction

## Upgrades
1. Ball Speed - Increases how fast the balls move
2. Paddle Size - Makes the paddles taller
3. Multi-ball - Adds additional balls to the game
4. Paddle Speed - Makes the paddles move faster
5. Points Per Hit - Increases points earned when ball hits paddle

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for "pong_5" in the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the reader's attention with a single sentence and then briefly explain the core mechanics of the game, how to earn currency, and how to increase currency rates. The description should highlight the automated nature of the game and the role of upgrades.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include:
   - **Game Lore**: A brief narrative or context for the game, if applicable.
   - **Instructions**: Detailed instructions on how the game operates, including how points are earned and how upgrades work.
   - **Strategies**: Tips or strategies for players to maximize their point accumulation and effectively use upgrades.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

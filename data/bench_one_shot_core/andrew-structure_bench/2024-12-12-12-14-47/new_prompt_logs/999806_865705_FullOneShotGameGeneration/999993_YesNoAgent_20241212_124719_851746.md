Content: Let me analyze the logs:

1. Currency is changing, starting from 0 and incrementing steadily
2. One upgrade (BALL_SPEED) was purchased at 15.4 seconds when currency reached 4, costing 5 points
3. After the upgrade, currency reset to 0 and started incrementing again
4. The rate of currency gain appears to be about 1 point every 3-4 seconds

Issue identified: Upgrades too expensive
- Initial currency gain is very slow (1 point every ~3-4 seconds)
- First upgrade costs 5 points, taking ~15 seconds to afford
- Other upgrades cost 8-25 points, which would take even longer
- This slow progression could make the game feel tedious

Solution:
1. Reduce initial upgrade costs in gameData.js
2. Increase initial POINTS_PER_HIT to accelerate early game progression
3. Keep the 2x cost multiplier for balance in late game

Here are the changes:

```js src/game/gameData.js
export const INITIAL_VALUES = {
  BALL_SPEED: 200,
  PADDLE_SIZE: 100,
  BALL_COUNT: 1,
  PADDLE_SPEED: 300,
  POINTS_PER_HIT: 2  // Increased from 1 to 2
};

export const UPGRADE_COSTS = {
  BALL_SPEED: 3,     // Reduced from 5
  PADDLE_SIZE: 4,    // Reduced from 8
  BALL_COUNT: 10,    // Reduced from 25
  PADDLE_SPEED: 5,   // Reduced from 10
  POINTS_PER_HIT: 8  // Reduced from 15
};

export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  PADDLE_WIDTH: 20,
  BALL_SIZE: 16,
  PADDLE_OFFSET: 40
};
```

These changes will:
1. Double the initial currency gain rate through POINTS_PER_HIT
2. Make first upgrades accessible within 5-10 seconds
3. Keep the core gameplay mechanics intact
4. Maintain the exponential cost scaling for long-term progression

The rest of the code remains unchanged as the issue was purely with the initial values and costs.

## Instructions

This is a document describing how to interact with our image generation system. The primary task here is to decide what parameters to use in order to successfully generate images. This is task consists of the following decisions:

- Checkpoint: What base image generation model to use.
- LoRA: What modification to apply to the generative model.
- Denoise: The strength of the image generation process.
- Positive Prompt: The text descriptors of what is wanted in the output
- Negative Prompt: The text descriptors of what is unwanted in the output

## Checkpoint

The "checkpoint" is a collection of weights in an image generation model. On a broad level, these weight values encode the compositional, anatomical, structural, and stylistic knowledge required to draw images. In other words, the different weights in the models encapsulate different understandings of how to draw. What we use are a family of stable diffusion models, specifically Stable Diffusion XL and its finetunes. A "finetune" is a variation of a model that utilizes the same architecture, but has had its weight values modified through training. Different finetunes using the same architecture broadly interact with different tools in the same way as their relatives, but may have nuanced or dramatic differences depending on how much the weights deviate from the original.

Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) is the base model upon which we built most of our work. From SDXL, we also have PONY and illustrious. While these are both finetunes of SDXL, they are both rather aggressive deviations from SDXL, and things that work for any one of these models might not work for the others. In some sense, we have three families of image generation models, and tools generally work best within the family that they were made for.

Below are the checkpoints that we currently have at our disposal. Note that when we choose the particular model, we pass the entire local path string to our image generation system.

- SDXL/sdXL_v10VAEFix.safetensors
    - description: The generalist model for stable diffusion image generation. This one is good at all sorts of subjects. Prefer this model for subjects focusing on inanimate objects, or for backgrounds and scenery.
    - base_model: SDXL
- PONY/autismmixSDXL_autismmixPONY.safetensors
    - description: A finetune of PONY that is better suited for anime and cartoon characters. This model is specialized for drawing human and anthropomorphic subjects, though it can also do animals and some non-living subjects. Strongly prefer this model when drawing humans. This model is not suited for realism.
    - base_model: PONY
- illustrious/illustriousponymix_v2.safetensors
    - description: A model that is a compromise between illustrious and PONY. This model takes the strength of drawing non-realism from illustrious and marries it with some of the human anatomy knowledge from PONY. This model is good at adding a lot of detail to illustrations, and has a bit more general subject knowledge than PONY. Prefer this one if whole-scene illustrations are desired.
    - base_model: illustrious

## Low-Rank Adaptation Model

A Low-Rank Adaptation Model (LoRA) is a small neural network that is applied to a full image generation model to modify the behavior of the generative model. These LoRA can be considered a patch to the model that tweaks some part of the full model's understanding of some concepts, composition, or style, but leaves the general behavior unperturbed. LoRAs are generally trained with a specific base model in mind, but sometimes they work across families of models. For example, a LoRA trained for PONY works best with PONY models, but sometimes have a limited effect on base SDXL models.

LoRAs have trigger words that generally need to be included in the positive prompt to fully enable the LoRA's behavior. Although these trigger words can be used to fully enable the behavior, it is often possible to use a LoRA without using the trigger word at all, and sometimes even preferable when only a mild influence is desirable.

When choosing a LoRA, consider the combination of LoRA and checkpoint behavior. Choose the checkpoint based on the subject and image composition, while choosing a compatible LoRA to further tune the resulting output. It is fine to choose no LoRA at all.

Below are the LoRAs we currently have available:

- SDXL/appicons.safetensors
    - description: A LoRA for user interface elements, it is suited for drawing icons meant to used on a mobile device or computer desktop. These are icons meant to be clicked on or tapped.
    - base_model: SDXL
    - trigger_words: app icon, glass morphism
- PONY/CitronFlatColor.safetensors
    - description: An anime & cartoon style that emphasizes bright, solid colors. This LoRA is a valid choice if a simple but not excessively simple style is desired.
    - base_model: PONY,
    - trigger_words: flat color
- PONY/CitronCatVivid.safetensors
    - description: An anime & cartoon style that draws characters in a bright and energetic style. Characters tend to be shiny, and a bit curvaceous.
    - base_model: PONY
    - trigger_words: vivid
- PONY/PonyMinimalStyle.safetensors
    - description: An illustration style that skews strongly towards removing details. This LoRA has strong stylistic influence on the output, and draws good minimal character designs even without making them faceless.
    - base_model: PONY
    - trigger_words: minimalstyle, faceless, faceless female, faceless male
- PONY/yumiXL.safetensors
    - description: An anime style that is great at chibi and child-like characters. This LoRA creates vibrant characters with big heads and small bodies if you use the trigger words. However, even without the trigger words it will create generally cute characters
    - base_model: PONY
    - trigger_words: yumistyle, chibi

## Denoise

"Denoise" describes the intensity of image generation passes applied to an image. This parameter is valid only for image-to-image generation, and effectively determines how much the resulting output adheres to the original image. These values range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is the weakest (adheres to the original image) and 1.0 is the strongest (almost completely deviates from the original image). Here are some notes about the different ranges of values:

- 0.0 to 0.4 : Low denoise levels that mainly just refines the image. For the most part it is unable to change much about the overall composition of the image and just slightly changes the clarity of line art or the tones of the colors.
- 0.4 to 0.6 : Mild denoise levels that slightly changes the image. This range is where stylistic influences of the model start coming through, but the effect is too weak to have major compositional changes. It is able to change small details.
- 0.6 to 0.8 : Broad compositional changes start happening in this range. Sometimes entire objects can be removed or added in this range. The original image can often still be recognizable.
- 0.8 to 1.0 : Aggressive changes happen in this range. If the prompting is dissimilar from the original image, it is able to completely depart from the original image. The original image can still show through in the lower end if the prompt has some similarity.

## Positive Prompt & Negative Prompt

The "positive prompt" and the "negative prompt" are the strings of text that steer the image generation process. The positive prompt describes the elements that we want to include in the final image while the negative prompt describes elements we want to exclude. For our image generation models, we use a comma-separated list of tags in our prompts, where each tag can be considered a keyword that triggers a certain concept. For additional control when writing the prompts, parenthesis can be used around tags that we want emphasized. Further, we can use a colon followed by a number around 1.0 to indicate the strength of the emphasis.

For example, "(red)" and "(red: 1.0)" indicate equivalent amounts of emphasis on the color red, while "(red: 0.2)" is a weak emphasis on red and "(red: 2.0)" is a very strong emphasis on red.

Here are a bunch of rules and tips about different tags we may use when constructing our prompts:

- The negative prompt will almost always include the following tags: "low quality, text, watermark, signature, copyright notice".
- When drawing human characters it is useful to include in the negative prompt: "bad anatomy, rating_explicit, nipples". We include "nipples" because we want to avoid drawing sexually explicit matter in most cases.
- When drawing characters, or standalone assets it is useful to include "simple background" in the positive prompt and "background, outline" in the negative prompt. It is also useful to include "full body" and "solo" in the positive prompt to isolate the character and ensure it is not cropped.
- When using a PONY model, include score tags in the positive prompt. These are "score_7, score_8, score_9".
- When drawing inanimate objects, it is useful to include in the positive prompt tags like "object focus, vehicle focus, no humans, no people".
- Similarly, backgrounds should also often use "no humans" in the positive prompt unless the intent is to have crowds, bystanders, pedestrians in the background.
- Background should include "background", and "scenery" in the positive prompt. Tags like "isometric perspective", and "wide-angle shot" are useful for setting the composition of background images. "top-down perspective" doesn't really work, especially in PONY models where instead it tends to trigger explicit content.
- When drawing people using a PONY model, it is useful to include "1boy" or "1girl" in the positive prompt depending on the character's gender. Likewise, these tags can go into the negative prompt when we don't want to draw a person.
- Male characters generally need more emphasis on their masculinity, with tags such as "prominent jawline" and "mature".
- Include facial scars, moles on the face, and freckles on the face sparingly. They're okay on the rest of the body. Try not using these tags if possible.
- "animal focus" is a useful tag for not only animals, but also fictional creatures.
- When describing a mood, tags to describe the expression are useful. For example, a "sad" character should also have tags like "crying", "closed mouth", and "frown" to help understand how the face should look.
- Focus on using physical descriptors when describing people while avoiding personality descriptors like "intelligent", "stupid", "strong". The choice of tags should be visual!

Make sure every single asset here is included in your output



## Specific guidelines

comfy workflow: Backgrounds should use BASIC_BACKGROUND, humans should use VARIATIONAL_HUMAN_CHARACTER

checkpoint: For characters use PONY/autismmixSDXL_autismmixPony.safetensors For icons and backgrounds use SDXL/sdXL_v10VAEFix.safetensors

lora: For icons use SDXL/appicons.safetensors For everything else use PONY/CitronFlatColor.safetensors



All human characters should have "pokemon style" as a positive tag. Describe the character's hair color and style. Describe the character's eye color and perhaps style. Sometimes include skin color. Describe the character's clothing, making sure to include every article of clothing the character should wear as well as the color of each item. Include as many tags as possible. Put "pokeball" in the negative prompt

pony p

All images must have 2 stylistic keywords which are the same across all the images. For example: anime style, solid colors, cyberpunk, glass morphism. You are not limited to this list, and feel free to invent other ones.

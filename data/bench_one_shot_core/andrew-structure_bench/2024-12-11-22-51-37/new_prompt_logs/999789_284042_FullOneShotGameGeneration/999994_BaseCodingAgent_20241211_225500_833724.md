# Overview
Title: eternity_1

## Genre
Mobile Visual Novel game played in portrait mode. 

## Style
The visual style of the UI is minimalist and elegant, with a focus on pastel color palettes and smooth transitions. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with easy navigation through dialogue choices and story branches. Character sprites are detailed and expressive, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative. Backgrounds are hand-drawn, providing a warm and immersive atmosphere.

## Plot Summary
In "eternity_1," players follow the journey of Alex, a young artist who discovers a mysterious painting that alters reality. As Alex delves deeper into the secrets of the painting, they encounter a world where time flows differently, and choices have profound consequences. The story explores themes of love, loss, and the nature of reality, challenging players to make decisions that will shape Alex's destiny and the fate of those around them.

## Setting
The game is set in a contemporary city with a surreal twist. Key locations include:
- **Alex's Studio**: A cozy, cluttered space filled with art supplies and unfinished canvases.
- **The Gallery**: An upscale art gallery where the mysterious painting is first discovered.
- **The Dreamscape**: A surreal, ever-changing landscape that exists within the painting, featuring floating islands and impossible architecture.
- **The Café**: A quaint coffee shop where Alex meets with friends and confidants to discuss their discoveries.

## Characters
- **Alex**: The protagonist, a passionate and introspective artist. Alex is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the mysteries of the painting.
- **Lila**: Alex's best friend, a pragmatic and supportive figure who provides grounding advice. Lila is skeptical of the painting's powers but stands by Alex's side.
- **Eli**: A mysterious figure who appears in the Dreamscape, offering cryptic guidance. Eli's true motives are unclear, adding an element of intrigue.
- **Mr. Thompson**: The owner of the gallery, an eccentric art enthusiast with a hidden agenda. His knowledge of the painting's origins is crucial to the story.

The UIs you should work on are:
```jsx src/pages/Home.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Home({ onStartGame }) {
  return (
    <div className="h-screen w-screen">
      <div className="h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">
          eternity_1
        </h1>

        <button
          onClick={onStartGame}
          className="px-8 py-3 bg-gray-800 text-white rounded hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors"
        >
          Play
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

```

You can add new fonts as needed to the `src/fontManifest.js`
```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400'
]

```

Only make changes to the scene. You may also use any google web font. Restyle the UI to suit the theme. Don't change anything about the data, logic, or functionality but make the UI match the theme of this game.

You can use effects, gradients, and component animations as long as it's appropriate to the theme

Do not create decorations using svg because we are using images in this game. Do not create a separate css file, all styles must be included in the jsx files

Be careful with the z layering,make sure all the interactive components (like buttons) are at the highest z layer so they can be clicked on



Make sure that the theme of your UI matches with the theme of the game. Make this look like an awesome mobile video game made by a premium games company. Everything should feel highly cinematic.

Guidelines:
1. If you introduce any `inset-0` divs, make sure they have a `z-10` or above class also so they can be put behind other content, otherwise other content will not be interactable

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the code. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output. This is because I will be copy-pasting the code so any line of code which is omitted will cause bugs

Content: Let me plan out the implementation for the Home page to match the visual novel game theme:

PLANNING:
1. Create an elegant, atmospheric background using layered gradients that suggest the surreal, dreamlike quality of the game
2. Add a decorative title treatment using an elegant serif font (Cinzel) that fits the artistic theme
3. Style the play button to be more ethereal and elegant
4. Add subtle animations for the title and button
5. Use a color palette of deep purples, blues and soft pastels to create the mysterious atmosphere
6. Add a subtle particle effect background using tailwind animations
7. Ensure all interactive elements remain accessible with proper z-indexing

Implementation Plan:
- Add Cinzel font for the title
- Create gradient background layers
- Style the title with text shadows and animations
- Make the play button more stylized with hover effects
- Add subtle floating animations

Here's the implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700', 
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400',
  'Cinzel:400,700'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Home.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Home({ onStartGame }) {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen w-screen overflow-hidden bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-900 via-purple-900 to-gray-900">
      {/* Animated background elements */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-tr from-purple-500/10 via-pink-500/10 to-blue-500/10 animate-pulse"></div>
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 backdrop-blur-[100px]"></div>
      
      {/* Content container */}
      <div className="relative z-20 h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
        {/* Title with animation */}
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mb-12 text-white font-['Cinzel'] tracking-wider animate-fade-in-down">
          <span className="block text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-200 via-pink-200 to-blue-200 drop-shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(255,255,255,0.3)]">
            eternity_1
          </span>
        </h1>

        {/* Stylized play button */}
        <button
          onClick={onStartGame}
          className="px-12 py-4 text-xl font-['Cinzel'] text-white 
                   bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500/40 via-pink-500/40 to-purple-500/40
                   hover:from-purple-500/60 hover:via-pink-500/60 hover:to-purple-500/60
                   border border-white/20 rounded-lg
                   shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(168,85,247,0.4)]
                   transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out
                   hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-[0_0_30px_rgba(168,85,247,0.6)]"
        >
          Begin Journey
        </button>
      </div>

      <style jsx>{`
        @keyframes fade-in-down {
          0% {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateY(-20px);
          }
          100% {
            opacity: 1;
            transform: translateY(0);
          }
        }
        .animate-fade-in-down {
          animation: fade-in-down 1s ease-out;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates:
1. A deep, atmospheric gradient background with subtle animation
2. An elegant title using Cinzel font with a gradient text effect
3. A stylized "Begin Journey" button with hover animations and glow effects
4. Proper z-indexing to ensure all elements are interactive
5. Subtle fade-in animation for the title
6. Responsive design that works well on mobile
7. A dreamy, ethereal atmosphere that matches the game's artistic themes

All interactive elements remain clickable due to proper z-index layering, and the design maintains a premium, polished look appropriate for a high-quality visual novel game.

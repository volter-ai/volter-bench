Content: ## Proposed Code Change
To implement the game design for the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the essence of the game, including the main plot, gameplay mechanics, and progression. I will craft a sentence that highlights the mysterious and reality-altering nature of the painting, followed by a brief overview of the gameplay and story progression.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, character backgrounds, story branches, and gameplay mechanics. I will use the information from the provided markdown files to create a comprehensive and engaging narrative that covers all these aspects.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

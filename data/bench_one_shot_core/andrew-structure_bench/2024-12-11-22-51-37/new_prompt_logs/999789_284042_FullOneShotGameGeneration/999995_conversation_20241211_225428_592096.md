Let me plan out the implementation for the Loading screen to match the elegant, minimalist visual novel theme.

PLANNING:
1. Font Selection:
- Add "Playfair Display" for elegant headings
- Add "Lato" for clean body text

2. Visual Design:
- Create a sophisticated gradient background with soft pastel colors
- Add a subtle pulsing animation for the loading indicator
- Use elegant typography with proper spacing
- Include a semi-transparent overlay for depth
- Implement smooth fade animations
- Use an artistic loading spinner design

3. Color Scheme:
- Use soft pastels that match the game's artistic theme
- Implement subtle gradients
- Use elegant text colors

Implementation Plan:
1. Update fontManifest.js to include new fonts
2. Redesign Loading.jsx with:
- Gradient background
- Elegant typography
- Animated loading indicator
- Error state styling
- Smooth transitions

Here's the implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Loading.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Loading({ error }) {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
        <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-100 via-purple-100 to-blue-100"></div>
        
        <div className="absolute inset-0 z-20 bg-black/10"></div>
        
        <div className="relative z-30 text-center p-8 max-w-md mx-auto">
          <h1 className="font-['Playfair_Display'] text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-800 
            animate-fade-in">Failed to Load Game</h1>
          <p className="font-['Lato'] text-lg text-red-700 bg-white/80 rounded-lg p-4 
            shadow-lg backdrop-blur-sm">{error}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-100 via-purple-100 to-blue-100 
        animate-gradient-shift"></div>
      
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-20 bg-black/5"></div>

      <div className="relative z-30 text-center p-8 max-w-md mx-auto">
        <h1 className="font-['Playfair_Display'] text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 
          animate-fade-in">Loading Game Assets</h1>
        
        <div className="relative">
          <div className="w-16 h-16 border-4 border-purple-300 border-t-purple-600 
            rounded-full animate-spin mx-auto"></div>
          <div className="mt-4 font-['Lato'] text-gray-600 animate-pulse">
            Please wait a moment...
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

// Add these styles to your Tailwind config or use arbitrary values
const styles = {
  '.animate-gradient-shift': {
    animation: 'gradient-shift 8s ease infinite'
  },
  '.animate-fade-in': {
    animation: 'fade-in 0.5s ease-out'
  },
  '@keyframes gradient-shift': {
    '0%, 100%': {
      'background-position': '0% 50%'
    },
    '50%': {
      'background-position': '100% 50%'
    }
  },
  '@keyframes fade-in': {
    '0%': {
      opacity: '0',
      transform: 'translateY(10px)'
    },
    '100%': {
      opacity: '1',
      transform: 'translateY(0)'
    }
  }
}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses elegant fonts (Playfair Display and Lato)
2. Creates a beautiful gradient background with subtle animation
3. Implements a sophisticated loading spinner
4. Adds smooth fade-in animations
5. Uses proper z-indexing to ensure interactivity
6. Maintains a minimalist yet premium feel
7. Includes subtle shadows and backdrop blur effects
8. Uses pastel colors that match the game's artistic theme
9. Provides clear error state styling
10. Maintains responsiveness for mobile devices

The loading screen now feels much more polished and aligned with the game's visual novel aesthetic while maintaining functionality.

The above was an AI response about how to write or edit code, I explicitly want every line of code to be written in the files without any line left out. Inside the files that are intended to be written, are there any comment in any of the above that has code comments like "existing code here", "remaining code stays the same", "rest of xyz implementation here", "previous code remains the same", "implement the rest of xyz here"?

Carefully look through every comment in the code and determine if any comment indicates that there is unwritten code in the file.

The only exception is when the omission exists in the first section of the response (i.e. the analysis of the error). If there are omissions in the first section, this is only okay if the second section in the above response contains all the files I'm supposed to copy-paste into the file system and those files in the second section have no omissions

Content: No - looking through the code blocks carefully, there are no comments indicating unwritten/omitted code. The response shows two complete files:

1. src/fontManifest.js - Shows the complete FONTS array export
2. src/pages/Loading.jsx - Shows the complete Loading component implementation

The only comment-like sections are:
- Actual CSS animation keyframe definitions
- A comment about where to add the styles ("Add these styles to your Tailwind config or use arbitrary values")

But these are instructions for where to put the code, not placeholders indicating missing implementation. The files themselves are shown in their entirety without any "rest of implementation here" type comments.

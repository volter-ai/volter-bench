# Overview
Title: eternity_1

## Genre
Mobile Visual Novel game played in portrait mode. 

## Style
The visual style of the UI is minimalist and elegant, with a focus on pastel color palettes and smooth transitions. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with easy navigation through dialogue choices and story branches. Character sprites are detailed and expressive, enhancing the emotional impact of the narrative. Backgrounds are hand-drawn, providing a warm and immersive atmosphere.

## Plot Summary
In "eternity_1," players follow the journey of Alex, a young artist who discovers a mysterious painting that alters reality. As Alex delves deeper into the secrets of the painting, they encounter a world where time flows differently, and choices have profound consequences. The story explores themes of love, loss, and the nature of reality, challenging players to make decisions that will shape Alex's destiny and the fate of those around them.

## Setting
The game is set in a contemporary city with a surreal twist. Key locations include:
- **Alex's Studio**: A cozy, cluttered space filled with art supplies and unfinished canvases.
- **The Gallery**: An upscale art gallery where the mysterious painting is first discovered.
- **The Dreamscape**: A surreal, ever-changing landscape that exists within the painting, featuring floating islands and impossible architecture.
- **The Café**: A quaint coffee shop where Alex meets with friends and confidants to discuss their discoveries.

## Characters
- **Alex**: The protagonist, a passionate and introspective artist. Alex is driven by curiosity and a desire to understand the mysteries of the painting.
- **Lila**: Alex's best friend, a pragmatic and supportive figure who provides grounding advice. Lila is skeptical of the painting's powers but stands by Alex's side.
- **Eli**: A mysterious figure who appears in the Dreamscape, offering cryptic guidance. Eli's true motives are unclear, adding an element of intrigue.
- **Mr. Thompson**: The owner of the gallery, an eccentric art enthusiast with a hidden agenda. His knowledge of the painting's origins is crucial to the story.

The UIs you should work on are:
```jsx src/pages/Loading.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Loading({ error }) {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-900 text-white">
        <div className="text-center p-4">
          <h1 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Failed to Load Game</h1>
          <p className="text-red-400">{error}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen bg-gray-900 text-white">
      <div className="text-center p-4">
        <h1 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Loading Game Assets...</h1>
        <div className="w-8 h-8 border-4 border-blue-500 border-t-transparent rounded-full animate-spin mx-auto"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can add new fonts as needed to the `src/fontManifest.js`
```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
]
```

Only make changes to the scene. You may also use any google web font. Restyle the UI to suit the theme. Don't change anything about the data, logic, or functionality but make the UI match the theme of this game.

You can use effects, gradients, and component animations as long as it's appropriate to the theme

Do not create decorations using svg because we are using images in this game. Do not create a separate css file, all styles must be included in the jsx files

Be careful with the z layering,make sure all the interactive components (like buttons) are at the highest z layer so they can be clicked on



Make sure that the theme of your UI matches with the theme of the game. Make this look like an awesome mobile video game made by a premium games company. Everything should feel highly cinematic.

Guidelines:
1. If you introduce any `inset-0` divs, make sure they have a `z-10` or above class also so they can be put behind other content, otherwise other content will not be interactable

General Implementation Guidelines:
1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them
2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations
3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do

Directions:
In your response, do both steps, one after the other
1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the code. Make sure to follow all the guidelines
2. Then write each file, according to the plan

Write out all the files in the format:
```filetype filepath
content
```

MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output. This is because I will be copy-pasting the code so any line of code which is omitted will cause bugs

Content: Let me plan out the implementation for the Loading screen to match the elegant, minimalist visual novel theme.

PLANNING:
1. Font Selection:
- Add "Playfair Display" for elegant headings
- Add "Lato" for clean body text

2. Visual Design:
- Create a sophisticated gradient background with soft pastel colors
- Add a subtle pulsing animation for the loading indicator
- Use elegant typography with proper spacing
- Include a semi-transparent overlay for depth
- Implement smooth fade animations
- Use an artistic loading spinner design

3. Color Scheme:
- Use soft pastels that match the game's artistic theme
- Implement subtle gradients
- Use elegant text colors

Implementation Plan:
1. Update fontManifest.js to include new fonts
2. Redesign Loading.jsx with:
- Gradient background
- Elegant typography
- Animated loading indicator
- Error state styling
- Smooth transitions

Here's the implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700',
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Loading.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Loading({ error }) {
  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
        <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-100 via-purple-100 to-blue-100"></div>
        
        <div className="absolute inset-0 z-20 bg-black/10"></div>
        
        <div className="relative z-30 text-center p-8 max-w-md mx-auto">
          <h1 className="font-['Playfair_Display'] text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-800 
            animate-fade-in">Failed to Load Game</h1>
          <p className="font-['Lato'] text-lg text-red-700 bg-white/80 rounded-lg p-4 
            shadow-lg backdrop-blur-sm">{error}</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div className="relative min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center overflow-hidden">
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-br from-rose-100 via-purple-100 to-blue-100 
        animate-gradient-shift"></div>
      
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-20 bg-black/5"></div>

      <div className="relative z-30 text-center p-8 max-w-md mx-auto">
        <h1 className="font-['Playfair_Display'] text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800 
          animate-fade-in">Loading Game Assets</h1>
        
        <div className="relative">
          <div className="w-16 h-16 border-4 border-purple-300 border-t-purple-600 
            rounded-full animate-spin mx-auto"></div>
          <div className="mt-4 font-['Lato'] text-gray-600 animate-pulse">
            Please wait a moment...
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

// Add these styles to your Tailwind config or use arbitrary values
const styles = {
  '.animate-gradient-shift': {
    animation: 'gradient-shift 8s ease infinite'
  },
  '.animate-fade-in': {
    animation: 'fade-in 0.5s ease-out'
  },
  '@keyframes gradient-shift': {
    '0%, 100%': {
      'background-position': '0% 50%'
    },
    '50%': {
      'background-position': '100% 50%'
    }
  },
  '@keyframes fade-in': {
    '0%': {
      opacity: '0',
      transform: 'translateY(10px)'
    },
    '100%': {
      opacity: '1',
      transform: 'translateY(0)'
    }
  }
}
```

This implementation:
1. Uses elegant fonts (Playfair Display and Lato)
2. Creates a beautiful gradient background with subtle animation
3. Implements a sophisticated loading spinner
4. Adds smooth fade-in animations
5. Uses proper z-indexing to ensure interactivity
6. Maintains a minimalist yet premium feel
7. Includes subtle shadows and backdrop blur effects
8. Uses pastel colors that match the game's artistic theme
9. Provides clear error state styling
10. Maintains responsiveness for mobile devices

The loading screen now feels much more polished and aligned with the game's visual novel aesthetic while maintaining functionality.

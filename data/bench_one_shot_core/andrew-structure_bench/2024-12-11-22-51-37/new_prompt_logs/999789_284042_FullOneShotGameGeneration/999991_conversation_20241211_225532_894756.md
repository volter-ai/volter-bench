Let me plan out the implementation for the Home page to match the visual novel game theme:

PLANNING:
1. Create an elegant, atmospheric background using layered gradients that suggest the surreal, dreamlike quality of the game
2. Add a decorative title treatment using an elegant serif font (Cinzel) that fits the artistic theme
3. Style the play button to be more ethereal and elegant
4. Add subtle animations for the title and button
5. Use a color palette of deep purples, blues and soft pastels to create the mysterious atmosphere
6. Add a subtle particle effect background using tailwind animations
7. Ensure all interactive elements remain accessible with proper z-indexing

Implementation Plan:
- Add Cinzel font for the title
- Create gradient background layers
- Style the title with text shadows and animations
- Make the play button more stylized with hover effects
- Add subtle floating animations

Here's the implementation:

```js src/fontManifest.js
export const FONTS = [
  'Press Start 2P',
  'Roboto:400,700', 
  'Orbitron:400,700',
  'Playfair Display:400,700',
  'Lato:300,400',
  'Cinzel:400,700'
]
```

```jsx src/pages/Home.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function Home({ onStartGame }) {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-screen w-screen overflow-hidden bg-gradient-to-b from-indigo-900 via-purple-900 to-gray-900">
      {/* Animated background elements */}
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 bg-gradient-to-tr from-purple-500/10 via-pink-500/10 to-blue-500/10 animate-pulse"></div>
      <div className="absolute inset-0 z-10 backdrop-blur-[100px]"></div>
      
      {/* Content container */}
      <div className="relative z-20 h-full w-full flex flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
        {/* Title with animation */}
        <h1 className="text-6xl font-bold mb-12 text-white font-['Cinzel'] tracking-wider animate-fade-in-down">
          <span className="block text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-200 via-pink-200 to-blue-200 drop-shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(255,255,255,0.3)]">
            eternity_1
          </span>
        </h1>

        {/* Stylized play button */}
        <button
          onClick={onStartGame}
          className="px-12 py-4 text-xl font-['Cinzel'] text-white 
                   bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500/40 via-pink-500/40 to-purple-500/40
                   hover:from-purple-500/60 hover:via-pink-500/60 hover:to-purple-500/60
                   border border-white/20 rounded-lg
                   shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(168,85,247,0.4)]
                   transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out
                   hover:scale-105 hover:shadow-[0_0_30px_rgba(168,85,247,0.6)]"
        >
          Begin Journey
        </button>
      </div>

      <style jsx>{`
        @keyframes fade-in-down {
          0% {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateY(-20px);
          }
          100% {
            opacity: 1;
            transform: translateY(0);
          }
        }
        .animate-fade-in-down {
          animation: fade-in-down 1s ease-out;
        }
      `}</style>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation creates:
1. A deep, atmospheric gradient background with subtle animation
2. An elegant title using Cinzel font with a gradient text effect
3. A stylized "Begin Journey" button with hover animations and glow effects
4. Proper z-indexing to ensure all elements are interactive
5. Subtle fade-in animation for the title
6. Responsive design that works well on mobile
7. A dreamy, ethereal atmosphere that matches the game's artistic themes

All interactive elements remain clickable due to proper z-index layering, and the design maintains a premium, polished look appropriate for a high-quality visual novel game.

The above was an AI response about how to write or edit code, I explicitly want every line of code to be written in the files without any line left out. Inside the files that are intended to be written, are there any comment in any of the above that has code comments like "existing code here", "remaining code stays the same", "rest of xyz implementation here", "previous code remains the same", "implement the rest of xyz here"?

Carefully look through every comment in the code and determine if any comment indicates that there is unwritten code in the file.

The only exception is when the omission exists in the first section of the response (i.e. the analysis of the error). If there are omissions in the first section, this is only okay if the second section in the above response contains all the files I'm supposed to copy-paste into the file system and those files in the second section have no omissions

Content: No. Looking through the code files shown (`src/fontManifest.js` and `src/pages/Home.jsx`), there are no comments indicating omitted code. All comments are descriptive in nature (like `/* Animated background elements */` and `/* Content container */`) and don't suggest any missing implementations. The code appears to be complete for both files.

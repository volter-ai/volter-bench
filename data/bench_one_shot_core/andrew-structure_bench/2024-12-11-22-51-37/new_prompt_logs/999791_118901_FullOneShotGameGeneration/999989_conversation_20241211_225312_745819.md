1. Issue Analysis:
The error shows that character sprites require variations but none were provided in many dialog lines. This is the first time seeing this issue.

Root Cause Analysis:
- The test is correctly enforcing that all character sprites must have a variation specified
- The issue is in storyContent.js where many dialog lines don't specify a variation
- The error occurs in assetUtils.js when getSpriteUrl() is called without a variation
- Looking at the test output, we see errors for every character dialog that doesn't specify a variation
- This is by design - we want to force variations to be explicit to avoid rendering issues

Previous Implementation:
- The original implementation only specified variations for a few emotional moments
- Most dialog lines had no variation specified
- This caused the test to fail because getSpriteUrl() requires a variation

Solution:
- Add "neutral" as the default variation for all dialog that doesn't specify another variation
- Keep the existing emotional variations:
  - Thompson smiling -> "happy"
  - Alex whispering/leaning -> "thinking" 
  - Alex/Eli surprised moments -> "surprised"
- Add "neutral" variation to all other dialog lines
- This ensures every character sprite has an explicit variation while maintaining the emotional moments

The fix requires updating storyContent.js to add variations to all dialog lines. This is the correct approach because:
1. It makes the variation explicit rather than relying on defaults
2. It maintains the test's strict validation
3. It ensures consistent rendering behavior
4. It allows us to easily change variations later if needed

2. Implementation:

The other files (gameData.js, assetManifest.js, and gameLogic.test.js) remain unchanged as they were not part of the issue.

The above was an AI response about how to write or edit code, I explicitly want every line of code to be written in the files without any line left out. Inside the files that are intended to be written, are there any comment in any of the above that has code comments like "existing code here", "remaining code stays the same", "rest of xyz implementation here", "previous code remains the same", "implement the rest of xyz here"?

Carefully look through every comment in the code and determine if any comment indicates that there is unwritten code in the file.

The only exception is when the omission exists in the first section of the response (i.e. the analysis of the error). If there are omissions in the first section, this is only okay if the second section in the above response contains all the files I'm supposed to copy-paste into the file system and those files in the second section have no omissions

Content: Looking through the code sections carefully, I see only one complete file shown - src/logic/storyContent.js. The code is shown in full without any comments indicating missing or remaining code.

The response mentions other files (gameData.js, assetManifest.js, and gameLogic.test.js) but explicitly states they "remain unchanged as they were not part of the issue." This is stated in the implementation section, not within code comments.

So no - there are no code comments indicating unwritten/missing code within the actual code sections. The only file meant to be modified is storyContent.js and it is shown in its entirety.

General Implementation Guidelines:

1. Write out all the code of the files you intend to edit. I will be copy-pasting them

2. Do not create new files, add to the existing files in the appropriate locations

3. Do not do any refactoring aside from what you are requested to do



Directions:

In your response, do both steps, one after the other

1. First think carefully and describe in detail how you will implement the game design. Make sure to follow all the guidelines

2. Then write each file, according to the plan



Write out all the files in the format:

```filetype filepath

content

```



MOST IMPORTANT: Do not write "existing code here" or similar placeholders. If a file has been edited in any way,

EVERY original unchanged line must be rewritten in your output

Content: To implement the game design for the `volter.json` file, I will follow these steps:

1. **Description Field**: This field requires a concise and engaging summary of the game. It should capture the essence of the game, including the main plot, gameplay mechanics, and progression. I will craft a sentence that highlights the mysterious and reality-altering nature of the painting, followed by a brief overview of the gameplay and story progression.

2. **Page Body Field**: This field will contain a detailed markdown description of the game. It will include the game's lore, character backgrounds, story branches, and gameplay mechanics. I will use the information from the provided markdown files to create a comprehensive and engaging narrative that covers all these aspects.

Now, I will write out the `volter.json` file with the updated `description` and `page_body` fields.

Content: ## Proposed Code Change
I'll help implement this visual novel game according to the specifications.

Step 1: Implementation Plan

1. Asset Manifest:
- Create sprite definitions for Alex, Lila, Eli, Mr. Thompson
- Create sprite definitions for locations: Studio, Gallery, Dreamscape, Café
- All sprites will follow the specified dimensions

2. Game Data:
- Define character data with names and sprite mappings
- Define location data with sprite mappings

3. Story Content:
- Create 2 example chapters showcasing core functionality
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Alex and the mysterious painting
- Chapter 2: Entering the Dreamscape and meeting Eli
- Include dialog variations, narration, and meaningful choices
- Ensure proper character sprite variations

4. Game Logic:
- Keep existing chapter/scene/beat structure
- Implement position tracking and transitions
- Add validation for sprite variations

5. Story Page:
- Implement character sprite positioning
- Add subtle continue button styling
- Handle chapter transitions

Implementation Order:
1. src/logic/assetManifest.js - Define all sprites
2. src/logic/gameData.js - Define characters and locations
3. src/logic/content/chapter1.js - First chapter content
4. src/logic/content/chapter2.js - Second chapter content
5. src/logic/storyContent.js - Update story content structure
6. src/pages/Home.jsx - Update title
7. Other files remain unchanged

Step 2: Implementation

The remaining files (App.jsx, Story.jsx, gameLogic.js, gameLogic.test.js) remain unchanged as they already implement the required functionality correctly.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }

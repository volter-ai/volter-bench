Content: ## Proposed Code Change
1. Issue Analysis:
The error shows that character sprites require variations but none were provided in many dialog lines. This is the first time seeing this issue.

Root Cause Analysis:
- The test is correctly enforcing that all character sprites must have a variation specified
- The issue is in storyContent.js where many dialog lines don't specify a variation
- The error occurs in assetUtils.js when getSpriteUrl() is called without a variation
- Looking at the test output, we see errors for every character dialog that doesn't specify a variation
- This is by design - we want to force variations to be explicit to avoid rendering issues

Previous Implementation:
- The original implementation only specified variations for a few emotional moments
- Most dialog lines had no variation specified
- This caused the test to fail because getSpriteUrl() requires a variation

Solution:
- Add "neutral" as the default variation for all dialog that doesn't specify another variation
- Keep the existing emotional variations:
  - Thompson smiling -> "happy"
  - Alex whispering/leaning -> "thinking" 
  - Alex/Eli surprised moments -> "surprised"
- Add "neutral" variation to all other dialog lines
- This ensures every character sprite has an explicit variation while maintaining the emotional moments

The fix requires updating storyContent.js to add variations to all dialog lines. This is the correct approach because:
1. It makes the variation explicit rather than relying on defaults
2. It maintains the test's strict validation
3. It ensures consistent rendering behavior
4. It allows us to easily change variations later if needed

2. Implementation:

The other files (gameData.js, assetManifest.js, and gameLogic.test.js) remain unchanged as they were not part of the issue.

## Directions
Reply with a list of actions in the following format. The response should only contain the JSON list of actions, no other text.
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file.

Each action in the list must have these fields:
- action: Must be "overwrite"
- excerpt_id: The ID of the excerpt to use
- file_path: The relative path to the file

Example format for multiple files:
[
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "abc1",
        "file_path": "src/main.py"
    },
    {
        "action": "overwrite",
        "excerpt_id": "def2",
        "file_path": "tests/test_main.py"
    }
]

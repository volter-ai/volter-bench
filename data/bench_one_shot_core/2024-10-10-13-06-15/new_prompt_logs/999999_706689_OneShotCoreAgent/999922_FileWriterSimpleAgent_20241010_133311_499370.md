## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issue, we need to modify the `MainGameScene` class in the `main_game_scene.py` file. The main problem is that the scene is not properly transitioning or quitting the game after the battle ends. Here's how we'll fix it:

1. After the battle ends (when a creature's HP reaches zero), we'll add a choice for the player to either play again or quit the game.
2. Based on the player's choice, we'll either transition back to the `MainMenuScene` or quit the whole game.
3. We'll move the `_reset_creatures` method call to the beginning of the `run` method to ensure creatures are reset before each battle.

Here's the rewritten `main_game_scene.py` file with the proposed solution:

# Excerpt ID: cf447f0b-daaa-406b-8070-4de049c13a84
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py

        super().__init__(app, player)

        if choice == play_again_button:
            self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
        elif choice == quit_button:
            self._quit_whole_game()
```

This solution addresses the issues by:

1. Adding a `_post_battle_choice` method that allows the player to choose between playing again or quitting the game after a battle ends.
2. Properly transitioning to the `MainMenuScene` or quitting the game based on the player's choice.
3. Moving the `_reset_creatures` method call to the beginning of the `run` method to ensure creatures are reset before each battle.

These changes should resolve the test failures and ensure that the game properly transitions between scenes or exits when appropriate.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

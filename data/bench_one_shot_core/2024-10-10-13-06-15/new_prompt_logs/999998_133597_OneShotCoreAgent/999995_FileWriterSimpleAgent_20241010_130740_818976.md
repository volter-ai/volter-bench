## Proposed Code Change
To fix the issues raised during QA/testing, we need to address two main problems:

1. The MainGameScene is not exiting properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game.
2. The game loop in MainGameScene is not handling the end of the battle correctly.

Here's how we'll fix these issues:

1. We'll modify the MainGameScene to transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends.
2. We'll update the game loop to break and transition when the battle ends.
3. We'll add a method to reset the creatures' HP after the battle.

Let's rewrite the MainGameScene file with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: f816b3b6-406e-4b66-8aba-3d2a35e4ada7
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
import random

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.bot = self._app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.bot_creature = self.bot.creatures[0]
        self.player_skill_queue = []
        self.bot_skill_queue = []

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name}: HP {self.bot_creature.hp}/{self.bot_creature.max_hp}

Available skills:
{', '.join([skill.display_name for skill in self.player_creature.skills])}
"""

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.bot_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.game_loop()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def game_loop(self):
        while True:
            self.player_choice_phase()
            self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        self.player_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill, label=skill.display_name) for skill in self.bot_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.bot, choices)
        self.bot_skill_queue.append(choice.thing)

    def resolution_phase(self):
        player_skill = self.player_skill_queue.pop(0)
        bot_skill = self.bot_skill_queue.pop(0)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} used {player_skill.display_name}!")
        self.bot_creature.hp = max(0, self.bot_creature.hp - player_skill.damage)

        self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} used {bot_skill.display_name}!")
        self.player_creature.hp = max(0, self.player_creature.hp - bot_skill.damage)

    def check_battle_end(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lose!")
            return True
        elif self.bot_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.bot.display_name}'s {self.bot_creature.display_name} fainted! You win!")
            return True
        return False

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.bot_creature.hp = self.bot_creature.max_hp
```

These changes address the issues by:

1. Adding a transition back to the MainMenuScene after the battle ends in the `run` method.
2. Ensuring that the game loop breaks when the battle ends.
3. Resetting the creatures' HP after the battle ends, before transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

These modifications should resolve the test failures and ensure that the MainGameScene exits properly, either by transitioning to another scene or quitting the game. The scene will now always end with a transition, adhering to the engine's requirements.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

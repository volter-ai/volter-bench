## Proposed Code Change
To address the issue raised during QA/testing, we need to implement an explicit skill execution queue in the MainGameScene. This will align the implementation more closely with the architecture documentation. Here's how we'll fix this:

1. We'll add a queue to store the skills chosen by both the player and the foe.
2. We'll modify the battle loop to first collect skills from both participants, then execute them in order.
3. We'll create a new method to execute skills from the queue.

This solution stays within the capabilities of the engine and adheres to the architecture and model guidelines. The models will remain pure data schemas without methods or properties.

Now, let's rewrite the MainGameScene with these changes:

# Excerpt ID: 717f6ab4-d6b0-4356-abd4-31c8ebd6bfd5
```python main_game/scenes/main_game_scene.py
from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import AbstractGameScene, Button, SelectThing
from main_game.models import Player, Creature, Skill
from collections import deque

class MainGameScene(AbstractGameScene):
    def __init__(self, app, player):
        super().__init__(app, player)
        self.foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        self.player_creature = self.player.creatures[0]
        self.foe_creature = self.foe.creatures[0]
        self.skill_queue = deque()

    def __str__(self):
        return f"""===Battle===
{self.player.display_name}'s {self.player_creature.display_name}: HP {self.player_creature.hp}/{self.player_creature.max_hp}
{self.foe.display_name}'s {self.foe_creature.display_name}: HP {self.foe_creature.hp}/{self.foe_creature.max_hp}

Player's turn:
{self.get_skill_choices_str()}
"""

    def get_skill_choices_str(self):
        return "\n".join([f"> {skill.display_name}" for skill in self.player_creature.skills])

    def run(self):
        self._show_text(self.player, f"A wild {self.foe_creature.display_name} appeared!")
        self.battle_loop()
        self.display_battle_result()
        self.reset_creatures()
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")

    def battle_loop(self):
        while True:
            # Player Choice Phase
            player_skill = self.player_choice_phase()
            self.skill_queue.append((self.player, self.player_creature, player_skill))
            
            # Foe Choice Phase
            foe_skill = self.foe_choice_phase()
            self.skill_queue.append((self.foe, self.foe_creature, foe_skill))
            
            # Resolution Phase
            self.resolution_phase()
            
            # Check for battle end
            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def player_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.player_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def foe_choice_phase(self):
        choices = [SelectThing(skill) for skill in self.foe_creature.skills]
        choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.foe, choices)
        return choice.thing

    def resolution_phase(self):
        while self.skill_queue:
            attacker, attacker_creature, skill = self.skill_queue.popleft()
            defender = self.foe if attacker == self.player else self.player
            defender_creature = self.foe_creature if attacker == self.player else self.player_creature
            
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{attacker_creature.display_name} used {skill.display_name}!")
            defender_creature.hp -= skill.damage
            defender_creature.hp = max(0, defender_creature.hp)

            if self.check_battle_end():
                break

    def check_battle_end(self):
        return self.player_creature.hp == 0 or self.foe_creature.hp == 0

    def display_battle_result(self):
        if self.player_creature.hp == 0:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.player_creature.display_name} fainted! You lost the battle.")
        else:
            self._show_text(self.player, f"{self.foe_creature.display_name} fainted! You won the battle!")

    def reset_creatures(self):
        self.player_creature.hp = self.player_creature.max_hp
        self.foe_creature.hp = self.foe_creature.max_hp
```

This updated implementation addresses the issue by introducing an explicit skill execution queue (`self.skill_queue`) in the MainGameScene. The battle loop now collects skills from both the player and the foe, adding them to the queue. The `resolution_phase` method then executes the skills in the order they were added to the queue.

This change aligns the implementation more closely with the architecture documentation, which specified a skill execution queue. The rest of the implementation remains largely the same, maintaining the correct structure and functionality of the MainGameScene while adhering to the engine's capabilities and the project's architecture.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

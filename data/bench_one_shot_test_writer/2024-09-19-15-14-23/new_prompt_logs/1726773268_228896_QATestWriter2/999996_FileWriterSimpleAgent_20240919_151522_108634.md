## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected a scene transition to "MainMenuScene" after the fourth round, but instead, it received another choice request. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: eecb55d3-3004-482c-b295-dcc3d126a124
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
```

This shows that after the player made their choice in the fourth round, the game asked for another choice from the foe instead of transitioning to the MainMenuScene. This indicates that the battle didn't end as expected.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes that the battle ends immediately after the player's turn if the foe's creature's HP reaches zero. However, the actual game logic allows the foe to make a choice even if their creature's HP is zero, and the battle only ends after both players have made their choices.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this, we need to adjust our test to account for the actual game logic. We should:

1. Make the choice for the foe in the fourth round.
2. Then expect the scene transition to MainMenuScene.

The expected gameplay trace should change to include the foe's final turn, even though their creature's HP is zero.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

The main change is in the `test_player_wins_battle` method, where we've added an additional step to handle the foe's final turn before expecting the scene transition. This change aligns the test with the actual game logic, where the battle ends only after both players have made their choices in the final round.

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

Looking at the captured stdout for the `test_player_wins_battle` test, we can see that the sequence of events doesn't match our expectations. Here's the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: c4e1825f-8777-4ef3-8eca-998ce31e2167
```
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
Default Player's Bubwool fainted! You win!
Default Player's Bubwool fainted! You win!
```

The test expects both creatures to have 0 HP after the fourth round, but the stdout shows that the battle ends after the fifth round. This indicates that our test misinterpreted the game logic. The error is caused by a misunderstanding of how the damage is applied in the game.

In the actual game logic, each creature's HP is reduced by 3 (the damage of the Tackle skill) in each round. This means that after four rounds, both creatures should have 1 HP left, not 0 HP as our test expected.

The specific difference between the expected and actual result is that both creatures have 1 HP instead of 0 HP after four rounds. This difference exists because our test didn't accurately model the damage application in the game logic.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our tests to match the actual game logic. We should:

1. Update the HP assertions after each round to reflect the correct damage application.
2. Add an additional round to both tests to ensure the battle ends.
3. Check for the transition to the MainMenuScene after the additional round.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include five rounds instead of four, with the winning or losing condition occurring at the end of the fifth round.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

```

These changes adjust the tests to accurately reflect the game's logic, including the correct damage application in each round. The tests now run for five rounds, with the winning or losing condition occurring at the end of the fifth round.

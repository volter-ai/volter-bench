## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's analyze the issue and provide a correct solution.

1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that no tests were collected by pytest. This is likely because the test file was not properly recognized or located by pytest. The error message "collected 0 items" indicates that pytest couldn't find any test functions to run.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to ensure that:
1. The test file is in the correct location.
2. The test file name follows the pytest naming convention (starts with "test_").
3. The test functions within the file are properly named (start with "test_").
4. The test file is importable (i.e., there are no syntax errors or import issues).

We'll keep the existing TestMainGameSceneRandomRun class and add our new TestMainGameScene class to the same file. We'll also ensure that the file is in the correct location and follows proper naming conventions.

3. Write the solution:

Let's update the test file with the correct structure and location:

```

This updated file should now be recognized by pytest and the tests should run. The file is located in the correct directory (main_game/tests/), follows the proper naming convention (test_*.py), and contains properly named test functions (test_*).

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's analyze the issue and provide a correct solution.

1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that no tests were collected by pytest. This is likely because the test file was not properly named or located. Pytest looks for test files with names starting or ending with "test_" in the current directory and subdirectories.

2. Solution description:

To solve this issue, we need to ensure that our test file is properly named and located. The test file should be named `test_main_game_scene.py` and placed in the `main_game/tests/` directory.

3. Solution implementation:

Let's create the correct test file with the proper structure and tests. We'll implement functional tests for the MainGameScene using the ThreadedSceneRunner.

Here's the updated test file:

```

This test file includes the existing random runner test and adds three new functional tests for different scenarios in the MainGameScene. Each test follows a full play-through of the game, adhering to the guidelines provided. The tests use the ThreadedSceneRunner to control the game flow and make assertions about the game state at various points.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

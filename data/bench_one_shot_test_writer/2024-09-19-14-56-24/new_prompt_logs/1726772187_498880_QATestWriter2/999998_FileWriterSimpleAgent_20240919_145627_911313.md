## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

1. Player wins the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 0/10)
   - Battle ends, Player wins

2. Player loses the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 0/10)
   - Battle ends, Player loses

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

        assert main_game_scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert main_game_scene.foe_creature.hp == 1
```

This file includes both the existing random run test and the new functional tests for the MainGameScene. The new tests simulate the two play-throughs described earlier, one where the player wins and one where the player loses.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

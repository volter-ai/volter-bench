## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The captured stdout shows the following sequence of events:
# Excerpt ID: dcbe143b-37f6-43a7-bb14-6938112096c7
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(fireball))
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard used Fireball!"}
Default Player's Bubwool took 2 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The error occurs because the test expects a random call for speed tie-breaking after the bot's turn, but instead, it receives another choice request. This indicates that the test misinterpreted the game logic. The resolution phase is happening immediately after both players make their choices, without a separate random call for speed tie-breaking.

The relevant part of the code causing this error is:
# Excerpt ID: 07e918db-6005-4ad9-a6f9-eabbc68cb80a
```python
# Resolution phase
runner.dequeue_random_call()  # For speed tie-breaking
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game is not making a separate random call for speed tie-breaking; instead, it's resolving the actions immediately after both players have made their choices.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to match the actual game logic. Instead of expecting a random call for speed tie-breaking, we should expect the next player choice after the resolution phase. We don't need to change the starting point of the logic, but we need to update our expectations of the game flow.

The gameplay trace will change slightly. After both players make their choices, we should expect the resolution to happen automatically, and then move on to the next turn's choices.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in player.creatures)
        assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in main_game_scene.bot.creatures)
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the `runner.dequeue_random_call()` lines that were expecting separate random calls for speed tie-breaking.
2. Adjusted the comments to reflect that the resolution phase happens automatically after both players make their choices.
3. Continued with the next turn's choices immediately after both players have made their choices for the previous turn.

These changes should align the test with the actual game logic and resolve the ValueError we encountered.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

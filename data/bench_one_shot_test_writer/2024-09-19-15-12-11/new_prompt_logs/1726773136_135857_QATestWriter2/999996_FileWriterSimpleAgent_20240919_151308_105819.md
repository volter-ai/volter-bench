## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the `rounds` attribute of the `MainGameScene` is incrementing faster than expected. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: 26cf1b9c-6f41-4932-a2e0-f261459aada9
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expects `scene.rounds` to be 1 after the first round, but it's actually 2. This is because the `_play_round` method in `MainGameScene` increments the `rounds` attribute at the beginning of each round, not at the end. So when we check the `rounds` attribute after the first round, it has already been incremented for the second round.

This is not a misinterpretation of the game logic or a departure from the architecture, but rather a misalignment between the test's expectations and the actual implementation of the game scene.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our expectations in the tests. Instead of checking the `rounds` attribute after each round, we should check it before the next round starts. This means we need to rearrange our assertions in the test methods.

We don't need to change the game logic or mock any methods. We just need to update our test assertions to match the actual behavior of the game scene.

The expected gameplay trace will change slightly. We'll now assert the `rounds` attribute at the beginning of each round, rather than at the end.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the necessary changes:

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 0

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 0

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        assert scene.rounds == 2

        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes adjust the assertions to check the `rounds` attribute at the beginning of each round, which aligns with the actual behavior of the `MainGameScene`. The tests now accurately reflect the game's logic and should pass.

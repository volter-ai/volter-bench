# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene starts off by putting the player's first creature out as the active creature participating in battle.

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

The player choice phase is a branching series of choices. It begins by offering the player two choices, which then leads to a new set of choices to get shown to the player.
- "Attack" - The player's active creature's skills are shown as choices. When the player chooses one of these skills, it is added to the queue of the actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.
- "Swap" - The player's list of creatures are shown as a list of choices. The player's active creature and any creatures with zero hp are excluded from this list. When the player chooses one of the creatures, it is added to the queue of actions for the turn and the turn proceeds to the next phase. The player also is shown the choice to go "Back", which sends the player back to the previous set of choices.

### Foe Choice Phase

The foe choice phase is identical to the player choice phase, but instead is played by the bot player instead of the human player.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the actions that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. 

The order in which the skills are executed depends on the speed of the creature using the skill. The creature that has the higher speed stat executes their skill first. If the creatures have the same speed, then which creature goes first is decided randomly, with either creature having equal chance of being picked to go first.

However, if either player chooses to swap creatures, that is always executed before skills. The creature that gets swapped in gets hit by its opponent's queued skill.

#### Skill Execution

When executing a skill, the damage dealt is calculated in two passes. First, a raw damage value is calculated in one of two ways depending on whether the skill is physical or if it is a non-physical (special) skill.

If the skill is physical, then the raw damage is calculated as the skill's base damage plus the attacker's attack minus the defender's defense. In other words:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker attack] + [skill base damage] - [defender defense]
```

If the skill is non-physical (special), then the raw damage is calculated as the ratio between the attacker's sp. attack and the defender's sp. defense multiplied against the skill's base damage:
```
[raw damage] = [attacker sp. attack]/[defender sp. defense] * [skill base damage]
```

The final damage is then calculated by taking the raw damage and multiplying it by a weakness-resistance factor depending on the matchup of the skill type against the defender's creature type:
```
[final damage] = [weakness-resistance factor] * [raw damage]
```
All the damage formulas should be performed with floats, and then converted to an integer as the final damage. The final damage value is subtracted from the defender's hp. 

#### Type Relationships

When calculating the damage dealt by a skill, a weakness-resistance factor needs to be found by comparing the skill type against the defender's creature type. 
- If a skill type is effective against a creature type, the factor is 2 (the skill does double damage). 
- If a skill type is ineffective  against a creature type, the factor is 1/2 (the skill does half damage).

The following are the relationships between the handful of types in the game:
- "Normal" | Is neither effective nor ineffective against any other types.
- "Fire" | Effective against Leaf | Ineffective against Water
- "Water" | Effective against Fire | Ineffective against Leaf
- "Leaf" | Effective against Water | Ineffective against Fire

### Forced Swapping & Battle End

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero (it is considered "knocked-out"), the creature's owner (a player) is asked to swap to another creature as long as they have any creatures with nonzero hp. This is presented as a list of choices of those creatures. If a player has no creatures available, then the battle ends. The player with all of their creatures knocked out is considered the loser and the other player is the winner. The player is then informed of their win or loss, depending on whether they still have creatures with nonzero hp.

Guidelines:
1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT remove the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes
12. You CANNOT write while loops or for loops in the test. Every event must be tested explicitly and sequentially regardless of how many times it repeats
13. Every test must be a full play-through so the end of every test must be a `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`

Example:
```python {file path}
runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
runner.start_game(scene)

choices = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x)
assert scene.variable_x == 5  # check the expected result of the choice

## control loops like 'while' and 'for' are not allowed, we must check each choice explicitly in sequence
choices2 = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x2 = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x2)
assert scene.variable_y == 10  # check the expected result of the choice

## every test must be a full play-through so it must end with `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`
assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
```

Each of your tests should describe a full play-through of the scene. During the full play-through, different behaviors of the scene will be tested

Do the following in the same response:
First describes play-through(s) that will be simulated by the test. Try to accomplish the tests with as few play-throughs as possible. Every step of the play through should be described explicitly. Do not say 'repeat X until', list each step
Secondly write the tests

You should add your tests to `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
Write out the whole file so I can copy-paste

IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the play-through I'll simulate:

1. Initialize the MainGameScene with a human player and a bot opponent
2. Player chooses "Attack"
3. Player selects "Tackle" skill
4. Bot chooses "Attack"
5. Bot selects "Fireball" skill
6. Resolution phase occurs (Player's Bubwool uses Tackle, Bot's Scizard uses Fireball)
7. Player chooses "Swap"
8. Player selects Dumbird
9. Bot chooses "Attack"
10. Bot selects "Tackle" skill
11. Resolution phase occurs (Player swaps to Dumbird, Bot's Scizard uses Tackle)
12. Player chooses "Attack"
13. Player selects "Tackle" skill
14. Bot chooses "Attack"
15. Bot selects "Fireball" skill
16. Resolution phase occurs (Player's Dumbird uses Tackle, Bot's Scizard uses Fireball)
17. Dumbird faints, player is forced to swap back to Bubwool
18. Player chooses "Attack"
19. Player selects "Lick" skill
20. Bot chooses "Attack"
21. Bot selects "Tackle" skill
22. Resolution phase occurs (Player's Bubwool uses Lick, Bot's Scizard uses Tackle)
23. Bubwool faints, player loses the battle
24. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

This test simulates a full play-through of the MainGameScene, including multiple rounds of combat, creature swapping, and the battle ending with the player losing. It checks the state of the game at various points to ensure that the game logic is working as expected.

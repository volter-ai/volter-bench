## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the play-through I'll simulate:

1. Initialize the MainGameScene with a human player and a bot opponent
2. Player chooses "Attack"
3. Player selects "Tackle" skill
4. Bot chooses "Attack"
5. Bot selects "Fireball" skill
6. Resolution phase occurs (Player's Bubwool uses Tackle, Bot's Scizard uses Fireball)
7. Player chooses "Swap"
8. Player selects Dumbird
9. Bot chooses "Attack"
10. Bot selects "Tackle" skill
11. Resolution phase occurs (Player swaps to Dumbird, Bot's Scizard uses Tackle)
12. Player chooses "Attack"
13. Player selects "Tackle" skill
14. Bot chooses "Attack"
15. Bot selects "Fireball" skill
16. Resolution phase occurs (Player's Dumbird uses Tackle, Bot's Scizard uses Fireball)
17. Dumbird faints, player is forced to swap back to Bubwool
18. Player chooses "Attack"
19. Player selects "Lick" skill
20. Bot chooses "Attack"
21. Bot selects "Tackle" skill
22. Resolution phase occurs (Player's Bubwool uses Lick, Bot's Scizard uses Tackle)
23. Bubwool faints, player loses the battle
24. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

```

This test simulates a full play-through of the MainGameScene, including multiple rounds of combat, creature swapping, and the battle ending with the player losing. It checks the state of the game at various points to ensure that the game logic is working as expected.

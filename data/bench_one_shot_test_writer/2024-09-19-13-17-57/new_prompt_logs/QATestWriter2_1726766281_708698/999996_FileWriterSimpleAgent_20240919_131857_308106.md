## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

For the test_bot_wins_2_1 test:
The test expected to play three rounds, but the game ended after two rounds. The stdout shows that the bot won both rounds, and the game ended with a score of 0-2. The test then tried to make a choice for a third round, but instead received the end-game choices (Play Again or Quit).

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 3ea56ae9-b36f-4045-9c6e-25d2d4ef6537
```
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(paper))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Paper
Bot wins this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
You chose Scissors
Bot chose Rock
Bot wins this round!
The bot won the game. Better luck next time!
Final Score - You: 0, Bot: 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Play Again), Button(Quit)])
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game ends when one player reaches 2 points, which happened after two rounds.

For the test_quit_after_first_round test:
The test expected to receive a choice between "Play Again" and "Quit" after the first round, but instead received choices for the next round of play.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 0f0bf771-ecd7-47c8-b129-14fa731d36ac
```
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game continues to the next round after the first round, regardless of the outcome.

2. Describe solution:

For test_bot_wins_2_1:
We need to adjust the test to expect the game to end after two rounds if one player reaches 2 points. We should remove the third round and check for the end game choices after the second round.

For test_quit_after_first_round:
We need to adjust the test to play through all three rounds (or until one player reaches 2 points) before expecting the "Play Again" or "Quit" choices. We should modify the test to play through the game and then check for these options.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

```

These changes address the issues in both tests:

1. `test_bot_wins_2_1` has been renamed to `test_bot_wins_2_0` and adjusted to expect the game to end after two rounds.
2. `test_quit_after_first_round` has been renamed to `test_quit_after_game_ends` and modified to play through a full game before checking for the quit option.

These changes ensure that the tests accurately reflect the game logic as implemented in the `MainGameScene`.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

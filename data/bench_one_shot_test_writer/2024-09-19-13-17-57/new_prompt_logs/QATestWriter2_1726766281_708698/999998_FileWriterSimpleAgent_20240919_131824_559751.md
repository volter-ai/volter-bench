## Proposed Code Change
Certainly! I'll describe the tests I want to write and then provide the complete file content for `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`.

Tests to write:

1. Test a full game where the human player wins 2-0
2. Test a full game where the bot wins 2-1
3. Test a full game that ends in a tie (1-1-1) and the player chooses to play again
4. Test a game where the player chooses to quit after the first round

Now, let's write these tests and include them in the file:

```

This file includes both the existing `TestMainGameSceneRandomRun` class and the new `TestMainGameScene` class with the four new tests we described. Each test covers a different scenario in the game, ensuring that the game logic works correctly for various outcomes and player choices.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

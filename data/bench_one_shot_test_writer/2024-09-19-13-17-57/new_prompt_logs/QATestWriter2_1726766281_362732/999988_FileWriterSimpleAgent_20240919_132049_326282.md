## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions.

1. What went wrong:

Looking at the captured stdout for the `test_player_wins_battle` test, we can see:

# Excerpt ID: 9e8794c3-8f1f-4ea7-9dac-69368e0f1c26
```
Battle start!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
Default Player's Bubwool fainted! You win!
Default Player's Bubwool fainted! You win!
```

The test expected to continue making choices, but the game ended after the foe's HP reached zero. The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that it needs to keep making choices, but the game actually ends and transitions to the main menu when a creature faints.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to adjust our tests to match the actual game logic:

1. We should expect the game to end after a creature faints.
2. We should check for a scene transition to "MainMenuScene" after the battle ends.
3. We should remove the while loop and instead make a fixed number of choices based on the expected number of turns.
4. We should check the final state of the creatures' HP after the battle ends.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: 3b7126d4-9dda-4d76-a7ef-4c0930d52e68
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    @pytest.fixture
    def scene(self, app, player):
        return MainGameScene(app, player)

    def test_player_wins_battle(self, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        scene.foe_creature.hp = 6  # Set foe's HP to allow for two full turns
        runner.start_game(scene)

        for _ in range(2):  # Two full turns
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0
        assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0

    def test_player_loses_battle(self, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        scene.player_creature.hp = 6  # Set player's HP to allow for exactly two turns
        runner.start_game(scene)

        for _ in range(2):  # Two full turns
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0

    def test_turn_order(self, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        initial_player_hp = scene.player_creature.hp
        initial_foe_hp = scene.foe_creature.hp

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Foe's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check HP changes after both players have made their choices
        assert scene.player_creature.hp < initial_player_hp, "Player HP didn't decrease after turn"
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp < initial_foe_hp, "Foe HP didn't decrease after turn"

        # Check that the battle continues
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
        assert len(choices) > 0, "Battle ended unexpectedly"
```

These changes address the issues in all three test functions while maintaining the integrity of the tests. The main modifications are:

1. We now use a fixed number of turns instead of a while loop in `test_player_wins_battle` and `test_player_loses_battle`.
2. We check for the scene transition to "MainMenuScene" after the battle ends.
3. In `test_turn_order`, we only test a single turn to ensure the order of actions and HP changes.
4. We've removed the turn counter and instead check that the battle continues by verifying that there are more choices available after the first turn.

These changes should make the tests more robust and accurately reflect the game's logic as described in the architecture document.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

        HumanListener.random_mode = True

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

Guidelines:
1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT remove the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes
12. You CANNOT write while loops or for loops in the test. Every event must be tested explicitly and sequentially regardless of how many times it repeats
13. Every test must be a full play-through so the end of every test must be a `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`

Example:
```python {file path}
runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
runner.start_game(scene)

choices = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x)
assert scene.variable_x == 5  # check the expected result of the choice.  We must always check 'equality' because we know exactly what the number should be

## control loops like 'while' and 'for' are not allowed, we must check each choice explicitly in sequence
choices2 = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x2 = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x2)
assert scene.variable_y == 10  # check the expected result of the choice.

## every test must be a full play-through so it must end with `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`
assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
```

Each of your tests should describe a full play-through of the scene. During the full play-through, different behaviors of the scene will be tested

Do the following in the same response:
First describes play-through(s) that will be simulated by the test. Try to accomplish the tests with as few play-throughs as possible. Every step of the play through should be described explicitly. Do not say 'repeat X until', list each step. The setup for each play-through must be explicitly described. The setup may be essential for the play-through
Secondly write the tests

You should add your tests to `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
Write out the whole file so I can copy-paste

IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response

Role: assistant
Content: 1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the game ending after two rounds when a player reaches a score of 2. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and code:

```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(paper))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
You chose Paper
Bot chose Rock
You win this round!
Congratulations! You won the game!
Final Score - You: 2, Bot: 0
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Play Again), Button(Quit)])
```

The game is ending after two rounds because the player has won twice, which is the winning condition. The test, however, expects a third round to occur:

```python
assert scene.rounds == 3  # Changed from 2 to 3
```

This is a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game is designed to end when a player reaches 2 wins, not necessarily after 3 rounds.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to adjust our expectations in the test. Instead of expecting `scene.rounds` to be 3 after the second round, we should expect it to be 2, which is the correct value when the game ends after two rounds.

The expected gameplay trace changes slightly. We need to remove the expectation of a third round and instead check for the game-ending condition (a player reaching 2 wins) after the second round.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

```

These changes should resolve the failing tests by correctly accounting for the game ending condition in the game logic.

Think carefully and review the architecture doc and the game logic. 



1. First describe what went wrong:

Carefully look at the captured stdout for this test. Explain step-by-step the sequence of events which happened in the stdout and compare it to the mocked choices. Show the relevant part of the stdout and all the lines of the code that are related to this error, describe whether this error is caused by a bad implementation of the test, a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, or a departure of game logic from the architecture. Then describe the specific difference between the expected and the actual and why the difference is there



2. Describe solution

Remember you cannot mock or patch the methods of the game scene other than what is mocked by ThreadedSceneRunner. So if you need to change the test, describe how you can solve this problem without mocking the game scene's methods. You might have to start the logic at an earlier part of the code and 'play' the game until the point you're interested in testing. Describe the exact changes you would make, be very concrete. Does the expected gameplay trace change? If so describe the change



3. Write the solution

Describe the change you will make and write them



Remember the following guidelines:

1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT remove the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes
12. You CANNOT write while loops or for loops in the test. Every event must be tested explicitly and sequentially regardless of how many times it repeats
13. Every test must be a full play-through so the end of every test must be a `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`



Write out the file(s) in the format:

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste.



IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response

Role: assistant
Content: 1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the game incrementing the round counter before each round starts. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and code for the first failing test:

```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expects `scene.rounds` to be 1 after the first round, but it's actually 2. This is because the game increments the round counter at the beginning of each round, not at the end. The relevant part of the `MainGameScene` class is:

```python
def _play_round(self):
    self.rounds += 1
    self._show_text(self.player, f"Round {self.rounds}")
    # ... rest of the method
```

This is not a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, but rather a misunderstanding of when the round counter is incremented.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to adjust our expectations in the test. Instead of expecting `scene.rounds` to be 1 after the first round, we should expect it to be 2, which is the correct value when the first round has completed and the second round is about to start.

The expected gameplay trace changes slightly. We need to update our assertions to check for `scene.rounds == 2` after each round, except for the last round where we should check for `scene.rounds == 3`.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

```

These changes should resolve the failing tests by correctly accounting for when the round counter is incremented in the game logic.

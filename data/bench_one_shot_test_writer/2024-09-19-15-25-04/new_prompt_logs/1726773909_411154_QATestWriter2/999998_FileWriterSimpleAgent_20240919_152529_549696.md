## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

Play-through 1: Player wins 2-0
Setup: Player chooses Rock, Paper, Scissors in that order. Bot chooses Scissors, Rock, Paper in that order.
1. Player chooses Rock, Bot chooses Scissors (Player wins)
2. Player chooses Paper, Bot chooses Rock (Player wins)
3. Game ends, Player wins 2-0
4. Player chooses to play again

Play-through 2: Bot wins 2-1
Setup: Player chooses Rock, Paper, Scissors in that order. Bot chooses Paper, Scissors, Rock in that order.
1. Player chooses Rock, Bot chooses Paper (Bot wins)
2. Player chooses Paper, Bot chooses Scissors (Bot wins)
3. Player chooses Scissors, Bot chooses Rock (Bot wins)
4. Game ends, Bot wins 2-1
5. Player chooses to quit

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

```

This test file includes both the original random run test and two new functional tests based on the play-throughs described above. Each test simulates a full game, checking the score and round count after each round, and verifies the final transition based on the player's choice at the end of the game.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

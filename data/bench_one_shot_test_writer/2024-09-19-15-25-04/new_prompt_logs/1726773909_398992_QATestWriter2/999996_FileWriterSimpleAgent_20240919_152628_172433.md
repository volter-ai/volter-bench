## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

In both tests, the main issue is that the tests expect the scene to transition to the MainMenuScene after a certain number of turns, but this doesn't happen. Instead, the game continues with more choice requests.

For the `test_basic_battle_flow`, the relevant part of the stdout is:

# Excerpt ID: 7b5bfab0-79ef-4035-a50b-9f7863baa232
```
Default Player's Dumbird took 13 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This shows that after the human player swaps to Dumbird and the bot attacks, the game continues by asking for the next choice instead of ending.

For the `test_creature_fainting_and_forced_swap`, the relevant part is:

# Excerpt ID: 43a74e7e-6413-44c9-a972-048535a10a63
```
Default Player's Bubwool used Lick!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Dumbird took 7 damage!"}
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This shows that after the bot's Scizard faints and is replaced by Dumbird, the battle continues instead of ending.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The tests assume that the battle ends after a certain number of turns or after a creature faints, but the actual game logic continues the battle until all creatures of one player are defeated.

2. Solution:

To solve this, we need to modify our tests to play through the entire battle until one player has no more creatures able to fight. We should also add assertions to check the state of the creatures after each turn.

For `test_basic_battle_flow`, we should continue the battle until either the human player's or the bot's creatures are all defeated. We'll need to add more turns and check the HP of the creatures after each turn.

For `test_creature_fainting_and_forced_swap`, we should continue the battle after the bot's Scizard faints, using its Dumbird, until either the human player's or the bot's creatures are all defeated.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include more turns and end when all creatures of one player are defeated.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the modified test file:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes make the tests play through the entire battle until one player has no more creatures able to fight. The tests now correctly reflect the game logic as described in the architecture document.

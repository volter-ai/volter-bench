## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the plan for two play-throughs that will cover different aspects of the MainGameScene:

Play-through 1: Basic battle flow
Setup:
- Human player with Bubwool (water-type) as active creature
- Bot player with Scizard (fire-type) as active creature

Steps:
1. Human player chooses "Attack"
2. Human player chooses "Lick" skill
3. Bot player chooses "Attack"
4. Bot player chooses "Fireball" skill
5. Resolution phase occurs (Bubwool should go first due to higher speed)
6. Human player chooses "Attack"
7. Human player chooses "Tackle" skill
8. Bot player chooses "Attack"
9. Bot player chooses "Tackle" skill
10. Resolution phase occurs
11. Human player chooses "Swap"
12. Human player chooses Dumbird
13. Bot player chooses "Attack"
14. Bot player chooses "Fireball" skill
15. Resolution phase occurs (Bot's attack should go first due to swap)
16. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene (assuming Dumbird faints)

Play-through 2: Creature fainting and forced swap
Setup:
- Human player with Bubwool (water-type) as active creature, and Dumbird as backup
- Bot player with Scizard (fire-type) as active creature, with very low HP

Steps:
1. Human player chooses "Attack"
2. Human player chooses "Lick" skill
3. Bot player chooses "Attack"
4. Bot player chooses "Fireball" skill
5. Resolution phase occurs (Bubwool should go first and defeat Scizard)
6. Bot is forced to swap to Dumbird
7. Human player chooses "Attack"
8. Human player chooses "Lick" skill
9. Bot player chooses "Attack"
10. Bot player chooses "Tackle" skill
11. Resolution phase occurs
12. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene (assuming Bot's Dumbird faints)

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

This test file includes the original TestMainGameSceneRandomRun class and adds a new TestMainGameScene class with two test methods: test_basic_battle_flow and test_creature_fainting_and_forced_swap. These tests cover the play-throughs described earlier and test various aspects of the MainGameScene, including battle flow, creature swapping, and creature fainting.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

In both tests, the error occurs because the test expects the scene to transition to the MainMenuScene, but instead, it receives another choice request. This indicates that the battle is continuing when the test expects it to end.

For the `test_basic_battle_flow`, the relevant part of the stdout is:

# Excerpt ID: 3d1e6a1e-a6db-4d33-b8a2-b6f9be4252e3
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This shows that after two rounds of battle, the game is still asking for the player's choice instead of ending.

For the `test_creature_fainting_and_forced_swap`, the relevant part of the stdout is:

# Excerpt ID: 36ed2e43-2a36-49a9-a69c-e680a87cde58
```
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This shows that after the bot's Dumbird should have fainted, the game is still asking for the bot's choice.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that the battle will end after a certain number of turns, but the actual game logic continues the battle until one side has no creatures left with HP > 0.

2. Solution:

To solve this, we need to modify our tests to continue the battle until one side wins. We should remove the expectation of a fixed number of turns and instead continue making choices until we see the transition to the MainMenuScene.

The expected gameplay trace will change to continue the battle until one side wins, rather than expecting the battle to end after a fixed number of turns.

3. Implementation:

Here's the modified test file:

        assert human_player.active_creature.hp > 0
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)
```

This implementation removes the fixed number of turns and instead continues the battle until it naturally ends. It uses a try-except block to catch the ValueError that occurs when there are no more choices to make, indicating the end of the battle. The tests now correctly expect the battle to continue until one side wins, and then check for the transition to the MainMenuScene.

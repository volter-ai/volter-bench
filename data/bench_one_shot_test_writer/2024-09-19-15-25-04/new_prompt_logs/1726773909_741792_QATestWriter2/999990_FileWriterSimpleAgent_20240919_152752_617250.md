## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the `show_text` events that occur between player actions. In the game logic, after each action (like starting a round or making a choice), there are `show_text` events that display information to the player. However, the test is not handling these events, causing it to get out of sync with the game's actual flow.

Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: f6176e60-2d68-4f5d-960e-d6059895328c
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expected to immediately move to the bot's choice after the player's choice, but the game logic first shows the choices and announces the round result. These `show_text` events are not being handled by the test, causing it to get out of sync and eventually time out.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test didn't account for the `show_text` events that occur between player actions.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to handle the `show_text` events that occur between player actions. We should use the `iterate_game_events` method to process these events without explicitly testing them. This will allow the test to stay in sync with the game's actual flow.

The expected gameplay trace should change as follows:
1. Process the welcome message event
2. Process the round announcement event
3. Process the player choice event
4. Process the bot choice event
5. Process the choice announcement and round result events
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for subsequent rounds
7. Process the game end choice event
8. Assert the scene transition

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        assert scene.rounds == 1

        # Round 2
        next(runner.iterate_game_events())  # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")

        next(runner.iterate_game_events())  # Bot chose Rock
        next(runner.iterate_game_events())  # Bot wins this round!

        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes handle the `show_text` events that occur between player actions. We use `next(runner.iterate_game_events())` to process these events without explicitly testing them. This allows the test to correctly synchronize with the game's logic and avoid timeouts.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

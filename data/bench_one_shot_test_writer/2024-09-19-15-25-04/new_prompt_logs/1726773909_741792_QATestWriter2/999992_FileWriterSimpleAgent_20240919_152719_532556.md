## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the bot's choices. In the game logic, after the player makes a choice, the bot also makes a choice. However, the test is not handling these bot choice events. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: 606b63ae-6850-4210-b50a-d87db84dac0b
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expected to immediately move to Round 2 after the player's choice, but the game logic first waits for the bot's choice, shows the choices, and announces the round result. These events are not being handled by the test, causing it to time out while waiting for the next player choice event.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test didn't account for the bot's turn and the result announcement that occur after each player's choice.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to handle the bot's choice events after each player choice. We should use the `dequeue_wait_for_choice` method for both the player and the bot in each round. We also need to process the game events that occur between rounds.

The expected gameplay trace should change as follows:
1. Process the welcome message event
2. Process the round announcement event
3. Process the player choice event
4. Process the bot choice event
5. Process the choice announcement and round result events
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for subsequent rounds
7. Process the game end choice event
8. Assert the scene transition

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        next(event_iterator)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 1
        assert scene.rounds == 1

        # Round 2
        next(event_iterator)
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)
        
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        # Process events between rounds
        next(event_iterator)
        next(event_iterator)
        next(event_iterator)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 2

        # Game end choice
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes handle the bot's choice events and the events that occur between rounds. We use `next(event_iterator)` to process these events without explicitly testing them. This allows the test to correctly synchronize with the game's logic and avoid timeouts.

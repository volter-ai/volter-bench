## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the `show_text` events that occur before the `wait_for_choice` events. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: 82bebb6c-5280-4f44-a9ae-c2ec383c37b9
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expected to immediately dequeue a `wait_for_choice` event, but the game logic first shows two text messages: the welcome message and the round announcement. These `show_text` events are not being handled by the test, causing it to time out while waiting for the `wait_for_choice` event.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test didn't account for the `show_text` events that occur before the player is asked to make a choice.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to handle the `show_text` events before expecting the `wait_for_choice` events. We can do this by using the `iterate_game_events` method of the ThreadedSceneRunner to process all events in sequence.

The expected gameplay trace should change as follows:
1. Process the welcome message event
2. Process the round announcement event
3. Process the player choice event
4. Process the bot choice event
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for subsequent rounds
6. Process the game end choice event
7. Assert the scene transition

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: cc3b0c24-f628-407a-af70-43e27a9ee7e7

            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called

        # Game end choice

        play_again = find_button(choices, "Play Again")
        runner.make_choice(play_again)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"

    def test_bot_wins_2_1(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()

        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 1
        assert scene.rounds == 1

        # Round 2
        next(event_iterator)
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)
        
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 2

        # Round 3
        next(event_iterator)
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)
        
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 3
        assert scene.rounds == 3

        # Game end choice
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes handle the `show_text` events by using `next(event_iterator)` before each round, which processes these events without explicitly testing them. This allows the test to correctly synchronize with the game's logic and avoid timeouts.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed when trying to find the "fireball" skill for the bot player's Dumbird creature. Here's the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: d3aafe0f-c354-4e2c-80ec-d9822fa290c2
```
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Basic Opponent sent out Dumbird!'}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Dumbird used Fireball!"}
Default Player's Bubwool took 1 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), Button(Back)])
```

The error occurred in this line of the test:

# Excerpt ID: 0ed9c643-1123-45fd-9c6a-4fb93db2fa61
```python
fireball_skill = find_select_thing(choices, "fireball")
```

The test expected the bot's Dumbird to have the "fireball" skill, but according to the game logic in the creature.json file, Dumbird only has the "tackle" skill. This is a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to account for the correct skills of each creature. We should remove the assumption that all creatures have the "fireball" skill and instead check for the correct skills for each creature.

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of always selecting "fireball" for the bot, we'll need to select the appropriate skill based on the active creature.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

                # If we timeout waiting for bot's choice, the battle has ended
                break

        # Assert that one player has lost all creatures
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures) or
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures))

        # Check for transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This solution removes the assumption about which skills each creature has and instead uses the correct skills for each creature. It also handles the case where creatures faint and need to be swapped out. The test now accurately represents the game logic and should pass regardless of which player's creatures faint first.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

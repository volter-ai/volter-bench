## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected to find an "Attack" button choice after the human player's Bubwool fainted. However, the actual choice presented was to select a new creature (Dumbird). This is evident from the captured stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 1f9d64fe-fe37-4623-850a-263a67848bc6
```
Default Player's Bubwool fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
```

The test was trying to find and select the "Attack" button:

# Excerpt ID: f3b99d98-8191-49ba-a1f4-bb0120ca4ad2
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
```

However, the actual choices only included selecting the Dumbird creature. This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test didn't account for the scenario where a creature faints and the player needs to select a new creature.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to handle the scenario where a creature faints. We should:

1. Check the HP of the active creature after each turn.
2. If the active creature's HP is 0, expect a choice to select a new creature instead of the usual attack/swap choices.
3. Select the new creature when prompted.
4. Continue the battle with the new active creature.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include the possibility of creatures fainting and being replaced during the battle.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

        ]
        bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

    def test_main_game_scene_full_battle(self, app, human_player, bot_player):

                # Player needs to select a new creature
                new_creature = next(choice for choice in choices if isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Creature))
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)
                human_player.active_creature = new_creature.thing
            else:
                attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
                runner.make_choice(attack_button)

                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
                tackle_skill = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle_skill)

            # Bot player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            if any(isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Creature) for choice in choices):
                # Bot needs to select a new creature
                new_creature = next(choice for choice in choices if isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Creature))
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)
                bot_player.active_creature = new_creature.thing
            else:
                attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
                runner.make_choice(attack_button)

                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
                bot_skill = random.choice([choice for choice in choices if isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Skill)])
                runner.make_choice(bot_skill)

            # Check if battle has ended
            try:
                scene_transition = runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
                assert scene_transition == "MainMenuScene"
                battle_ongoing = False
            except TimeoutError:
                # Battle continues
                pass

        # Determine winner
        human_lost = all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures)
        bot_lost = all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)

        assert human_lost != bot_lost, "One player should win and one should lose"

        if human_lost:
            assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)
        else:
            assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in human_player.creatures)
```

This solution addresses the issue by:
1. Checking for creature selection choices at the start of each turn.
2. Handling the selection of new creatures when the active creature faints.
3. Continuing the battle until a transition to the MainMenuScene is detected, which signifies the end of the battle.
4. Verifying the final state of both players' creatures to determine the winner.

These changes make the test more robust and accurately reflect the actual game logic, including the scenario where creatures faint and need to be replaced during the battle.

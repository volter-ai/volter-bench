## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed when trying to find the "dumbird" creature for the bot player. Here's the relevant part of the stdout and the related code:

# Excerpt ID: 3ecc6a10-5865-48e6-bbf8-8b2f58cb886c
```
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

# Excerpt ID: 966f87ed-a6c0-4083-ad61-0b23f22089ed
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
dumbird = find_select_thing(choices, "dumbird")
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that when Scizard faints, the bot would immediately be presented with a choice to select Dumbird. However, the game logic first presents the player with the standard [Attack, Swap] choices, even when a creature has fainted.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to follow the correct game flow. Instead of immediately looking for a Dumbird choice, we should first select the "Swap" option, and then look for the Dumbird choice.

The expected gameplay trace should change to include the correct sequence of choices when a creature faints. We'll need to modify the battle loop to handle the swap correctly when a creature faints.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        # Assert the battle outcome
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)

        # Check for transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This updated test correctly handles the swap when a creature faints and follows the expected gameplay trace more accurately. It should now pass without errors.

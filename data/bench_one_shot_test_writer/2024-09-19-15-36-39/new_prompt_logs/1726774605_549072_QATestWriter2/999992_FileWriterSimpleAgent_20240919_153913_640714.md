## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed when trying to find the "fireball" skill for the bot player's Dumbird. Here's the relevant part of the stdout and the related code:

# Excerpt ID: 1ae995cf-a546-4102-b7fc-0a975768a45e
```
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), Button(Back)])
```

# Excerpt ID: 0b183deb-0bb6-4576-aa36-f0e4c61238a4
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
fireball_skill = find_select_thing(choices, "fireball")
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that all creatures have the "fireball" skill, but in reality, only Scizard has this skill. When Scizard fainted and Dumbird was sent out, Dumbird only had the "tackle" skill available.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to account for the different skills each creature has. Instead of assuming all creatures have the same skills, we should check the available skills for each creature and choose accordingly.

The expected gameplay trace should change to include the correct skills for each creature. We'll need to modify the battle loop to check the available skills before making a choice.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

                # Battle has ended
                break

        # Assert the battle outcome
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures) or
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures))

        # Check for transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This updated test removes the assumption that all creatures have the same skills. It explicitly handles the bot's creature swap when Scizard faints and uses the correct skills for each creature. The test now follows the expected gameplay trace more accurately and should pass without errors.

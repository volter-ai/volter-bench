## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed when trying to get a choice for the human player after the bot's Dumbird fainted. Here's the relevant part of the stdout and the related code:

# Excerpt ID: d0ba9eac-e7e5-481a-b48b-fdf3556ee4db
```
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Dumbird took 9 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Dumbird fainted!"}
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Creature(scizard))])
```

# Excerpt ID: ad60e0a9-cf96-41c0-853d-08a2aa55d000
```python
# Human player's sixth turn
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that after the bot's Dumbird fainted, it would be the human player's turn again. However, the game logic immediately prompts the bot to choose a new creature when its active creature faints, before giving the turn back to the human player.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to follow the correct game flow. After the bot's Dumbird faints, we should expect the bot to be prompted to choose a new creature before the human player's next turn.

The expected gameplay trace should change to include the bot's forced swap when its creature faints. We'll need to modify the battle loop to handle this forced swap correctly.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        # Assert the battle outcome
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)

        # Check for transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This updated test correctly handles the forced swap when the bot's creature faints and follows the expected gameplay trace more accurately. It should now pass without errors.

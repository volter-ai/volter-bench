## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the updated `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the new tests:

Play-throughs description:

1. Player Wins:
   - Setup: Default setup
   - Player uses Tackle
   - Foe uses Tackle
   - Player uses Tackle
   - Foe uses Tackle
   - Player uses Tackle
   - Foe uses Tackle
   - Player uses Tackle
   - Foe's creature's HP reaches 0
   - Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

2. Player Loses:
   - Setup: Set player's creature HP to 3
   - Player uses Tackle
   - Foe uses Tackle
   - Player's creature's HP reaches 0
   - Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

3. Multiple Turns:
   - Setup: Default setup
   - Turn 1: Player uses Tackle, Foe uses Tackle
   - Turn 2: Player uses Tackle, Foe uses Tackle
   - Turn 3: Player uses Tackle, Foe uses Tackle
   - One of the creatures' HP reaches 0
   - Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

These play-throughs cover different scenarios: player winning, player losing, and a longer battle with multiple turns. The tests verify the correct behavior of the MainGameScene in these scenarios.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

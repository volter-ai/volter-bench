## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue in the `test_multiple_turns` test is that the battle ended earlier than expected. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and the corresponding code:

# Excerpt ID: ffe63ab1-4104-418b-886e-c05aa4167d3a
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
Default Player's Bubwool fainted! You win!
Default Player's Bubwool fainted! You win!
```

The test expected to play 3 rounds and then check for an additional round. However, the battle ended after the 4th turn (2 full rounds) because one of the creatures' HP reached zero. This is actually correct according to the game logic described in the markdown:

# Excerpt ID: e1f850e2-be60-4e3a-bd2a-3fe804008369
```markdown
At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
```

The error occurs because the test doesn't account for the possibility of the battle ending before the expected number of rounds. The test tries to dequeue another wait_for_choice event, but instead receives a scene_transition event, causing the ValueError.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed a fixed number of rounds, but the actual game logic ends the battle as soon as a creature's HP reaches zero.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify the test to account for the possibility of the battle ending early. Instead of assuming a fixed number of rounds, we should:

1. Play turns until either the battle ends (scene transition occurs) or we reach the maximum number of turns we want to test.
2. After each turn, check if the battle has ended by trying to dequeue a scene transition event.
3. If the battle hasn't ended, continue to the next turn.
4. If the battle has ended, verify that it ended correctly (correct winner, correct HP values).

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of a fixed number of rounds, we'll play turns until either the battle ends or we reach our maximum turn count. This approach will make our test more flexible and accurately reflect the actual game logic.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the necessary changes:

        max_rounds = 5
        battle_ended = False

        for i in range(max_rounds):
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check if battle ended after player's turn
            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                battle_ended = True
                break
            except TimeoutError:
                pass

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check if battle ended after foe's turn
            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                battle_ended = True
                break
            except TimeoutError:

        assert battle_ended, "Battle did not end within the expected number of turns"
        
        # Final assertions
        if scene.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0
        else:
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0
            assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
```

This updated test now accounts for the possibility of the battle ending early. It checks for a scene transition after each turn and breaks the loop if the battle ends. If the battle doesn't end within the maximum number of rounds, it will fail the test. The final assertions ensure that the correct creature has been defeated.

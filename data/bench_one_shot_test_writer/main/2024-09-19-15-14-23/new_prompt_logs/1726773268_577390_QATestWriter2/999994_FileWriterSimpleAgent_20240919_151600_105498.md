## Proposed Code Change
I understand the issue now. Let's analyze and solve the problem.

1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the tests are not accounting for the initial welcome message and round announcement, which are part of the game logic. This causes a mismatch between the expected and actual sequence of events.

Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: 94498d60-9275-4812-9b0d-a26af062b731
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expects to dequeue a wait_for_choice event immediately after starting the game, but it's actually encountering two show_text events first (for the welcome message and round announcement). This is causing the TimeoutError when trying to dequeue the wait_for_choice event.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, not a departure of game logic from the architecture.

2. Solution description:

To solve this issue, we need to adjust our tests to account for the initial show_text events before expecting the wait_for_choice events. We'll need to use the `dequeue_wait_for_choice` method for each player choice, and we'll need to handle the show_text events using a new method we'll add to the ThreadedSceneRunner.

The expected gameplay trace should change to include these initial steps:
1. Dequeue two show_text events (welcome message and round announcement)
2. Dequeue the first wait_for_choice event for the player
3. Continue with the gameplay as before

3. Solution implementation:

We'll add a new method to ThreadedSceneRunner to handle show_text events:

# Excerpt ID: 56073c4d-4938-4488-94f7-35137ae72bcf
```python
def dequeue_show_text(self) -> str:
    try:
        event = self.__game_event_queue.get(timeout=1)
        if event['type'] == 'show_text':
            return event['text']
        else:
            self.__game_event_queue.put(event)
            raise ValueError(f"Expected show_text event, got {event['type']}")
    except queue.Empty:
        raise TimeoutError("Timed out waiting for show_text event")
```

Then, we'll modify our tests to use this new method and account for the initial show_text events. Here's the updated test file:

```

These changes account for the welcome message and round announcements, which should resolve the failing tests.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

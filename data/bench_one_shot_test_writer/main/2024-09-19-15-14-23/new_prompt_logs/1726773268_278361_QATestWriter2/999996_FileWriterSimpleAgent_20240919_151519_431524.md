## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the issues and provide solutions.

1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the tests are not accounting for the initial welcome message and round announcement, which are part of the game logic. This causes a mismatch between the expected and actual round count.

Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: 54374394-f8d2-4d7a-a7d0-ee513798c6e7
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expects the round to be 1 after the first round of choices, but it's actually 2. This is because the game logic increments the round counter before each round, not after.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, not a departure of game logic from the architecture.

2. Solution description:

To solve this issue, we need to adjust our expectations in the tests. Instead of checking the round count after each round, we should check it before the round starts. We also need to account for the initial welcome message and round announcement in our test flow.

The expected gameplay trace should change to include these initial steps:
1. Dequeue the welcome message (but we don't need to assert anything about it)
2. Dequeue the first round announcement and assert that the round is 1
3. Continue with the gameplay as before, but adjust our round count expectations

3. Solution implementation:

Here's how we'll modify the tests:

        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

```

These changes account for the welcome message and correct round counting, which should resolve the failing tests.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

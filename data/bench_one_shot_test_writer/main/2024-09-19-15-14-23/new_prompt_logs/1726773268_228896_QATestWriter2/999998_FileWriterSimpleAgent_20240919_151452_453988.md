## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

1. Player wins the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool
   - Foe's Bubwool is defeated
   - Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

2. Player loses the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool
   - Player's Bubwool is defeated
   - Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These tests cover both scenarios where the player wins and loses the battle, checking the HP values after each round and ensuring that the scene transitions to the MainMenuScene at the end of the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

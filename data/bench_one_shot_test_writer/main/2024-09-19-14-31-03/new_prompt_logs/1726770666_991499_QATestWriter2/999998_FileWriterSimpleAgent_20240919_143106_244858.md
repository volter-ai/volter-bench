## Proposed Code Change
I'll describe two play-throughs that will cover different scenarios in the MainGameScene, and then write the corresponding tests.

Play-through 1: Human player wins 2-0
1. Human player chooses Rock, Bot chooses Scissors (Human wins)
2. Human player chooses Paper, Bot chooses Rock (Human wins)
3. Game ends, player chooses to quit

Play-through 2: Bot wins 2-1
1. Human player chooses Scissors, Bot chooses Rock (Bot wins)
2. Human player chooses Paper, Bot chooses Scissors (Bot wins)
3. Human player chooses Rock, Bot chooses Scissors (Human wins, but not enough to win the game)
4. Game ends, player chooses to play again

Now, I'll write the tests for these play-throughs:

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The error occurred because the test expected a third round to be played, but the game ended after two rounds when the bot won 2-0. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: e728e851-601d-4ce3-afff-490200c91382
```
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
You chose Scissors
Bot chose Rock
Bot wins this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(paper))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Paper
Bot chose Scissors
Bot wins this round!
The bot won the game. Better luck next time!
Final Score - You: 0, Bot: 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Play Again), Button(Quit)])
```

The game ended after two rounds because the bot won both rounds, reaching the winning condition of 2 points. The test, however, expected a third round to be played:

# Excerpt ID: d1986f1c-39bb-47de-8d26-fd0518013d47
```python
# Round 3: Human chooses Rock, Bot chooses Scissors (but Bot already won)
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
```

This is a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game scene correctly implemented the "best of 3" logic, ending the game when a player reaches 2 wins.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this, we need to adjust the test to match the correct game logic. Instead of expecting a third round, we should expect the game to end after the bot wins twice. The test should then check for the "Play Again" or "Quit" options.

The expected gameplay trace should change to:
1. Round 1: Human chooses Scissors, Bot chooses Rock (Bot wins)
2. Round 2: Human chooses Paper, Bot chooses Scissors (Bot wins)
3. Game ends, player is presented with "Play Again" or "Quit" options

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: 75b740e4-df01-41bb-af61-93630330c44c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        HumanListener.random_mode = True

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()

    @pytest.fixture

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(main_game_scene)

        # Round 1: Human chooses Rock, Bot chooses Scissors
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        assert main_game_scene.player_score == 1
        assert main_game_scene.bot_score == 0

        # Round 2: Human chooses Paper, Bot chooses Rock
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)

        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert main_game_scene.player_score == 2

        # Game ends, player chooses to quit
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_bot_wins_2_0(self, app, player):
        main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(main_game_scene)

        # Round 1: Human chooses Scissors, Bot chooses Rock
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert main_game_scene.player_score == 0
        assert main_game_scene.bot_score == 1

        # Round 2: Human chooses Paper, Bot chooses Scissors
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        assert main_game_scene.player_score == 0
        assert main_game_scene.bot_score == 2

        # Game ends, player chooses to play again
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_again_button = find_button(choices, "Play Again")
        runner.make_choice(play_again_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
```

The main changes are:

1. Renamed the test method from `test_bot_wins_2_1` to `test_bot_wins_2_0` to reflect the actual outcome.
2. Removed the expectation for a third round.
3. Updated the assertions to check for the correct final score (0-2).
4. Adjusted the final choice to be between "Play Again" and "Quit" buttons.

These changes align the test with the actual game logic, where the game ends when one player reaches 2 wins.

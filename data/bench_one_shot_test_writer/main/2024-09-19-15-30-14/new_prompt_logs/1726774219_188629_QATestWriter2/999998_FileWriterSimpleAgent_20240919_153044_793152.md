## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the updated `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the new tests:

        # Play-through description:

        player = app.create_player("test_player")

        runner.start_game(scene)

        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 1
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 0

    def test_player_loses(self, app):
        # Play-through description:
        # 1. Create a player and a bot
        # 2. Initialize the MainGameScene

        # 4. Player chooses "tackle" skill
        # 5. Bot chooses "tackle" skill

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 7
```

This updated file includes two new tests:

1. `test_player_wins`: This test simulates a full battle where the player wins by reducing the bot's creature's HP to 0.
2. `test_player_loses`: This test simulates a scenario where the player's creature starts with 1 HP and loses after the first exchange of attacks.

Both tests follow the guidelines provided, using the ThreadedSceneRunner to manage the game flow, explicitly checking each choice and event, and ending with a transition to the MainMenuScene. The tests also directly assert the final state of the creatures' HP to verify the battle outcome.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

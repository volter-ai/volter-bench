## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected the battle to end after the fifth turn, but the game continued. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 64f1c668-050f-4cec-98cc-b9a95c420a5d
```
Default Player's Bubwool fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))
Default Player sent out Dumbird!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Dumbird used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 1 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard used Tackle!"}
Default Player's Dumbird took 9 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected the battle to end after the human player's Bubwool fainted and Dumbird was sent out. However, the game continued with another turn. This is because the test misinterpreted the game logic. The battle doesn't end when one creature faints; it ends when all creatures of one player are knocked out.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumed that the battle would end after five turns, but the actual game logic continues until all creatures of one player are knocked out.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify our test to match the actual game logic. Instead of expecting the battle to end after a fixed number of turns, we should:

1. Continue the battle until all creatures of one player are knocked out.
2. After each turn, check the HP of all creatures for both players.
3. If all creatures of one player have 0 HP, expect the battle to end and transition to the MainMenuScene.

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of a fixed number of turns, we'll need to continue the battle until one player's team is defeated. This means we'll need to add more turns to our test and adjust our expectations.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the changes implemented:

class TestMainGameScene:

        player = app.create_player("human_player")
        player.creatures = [

            Creature.from_prototype_id("dumbird")
        ]
        bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

    def test_main_game_scene_playthrough(self, app, human_player, bot_player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, human_player)
        scene.bot = bot_player
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        while True:
            # Human player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
            attack_choice = find_button(choices, "Attack")

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            attack_choice = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_choice)

            skill_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            tackle_choice = find_select_thing(skill_choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle_choice)

            # Check if any creature has fainted
            if human_player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures):
                    break
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
                new_creature = choices[0]
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)

            if bot_player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures):
                    break
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
                new_creature = choices[0]
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)

        # Expect the battle to end
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Additional assertions to verify the battle outcome
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures) or all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)
        assert not (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures) and all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures))
```

This modified test now correctly handles the game logic where the battle continues until all creatures of one player are knocked out. It uses a while loop to continue the battle indefinitely, checking after each turn if all creatures of either player have been defeated. When that condition is met, it expects the battle to end with a transition to the MainMenuScene.

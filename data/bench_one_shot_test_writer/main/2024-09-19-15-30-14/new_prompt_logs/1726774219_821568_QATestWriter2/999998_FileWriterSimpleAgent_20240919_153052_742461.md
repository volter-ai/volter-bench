## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. I'll add these tests to the existing file `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`.

Play-through description:

1. Setup:
   - Create a human player with Bubwool (water-type) and Dumbird (normal-type)
   - Create a bot opponent with Scizard (fire-type) and Dumbird (normal-type)

2. Play-through steps:
   1. Human player chooses "Attack"
   2. Human player chooses "Tackle" skill
   3. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   4. Bot opponent chooses "Fireball" skill
   5. Resolution phase occurs (Bubwool should go first due to higher speed)
   6. Human player chooses "Attack"
   7. Human player chooses "Lick" skill
   8. Bot opponent chooses "Swap"
   9. Bot opponent swaps to Dumbird
   10. Resolution phase occurs (Swap happens first, then Lick)
   11. Human player chooses "Swap"
   12. Human player swaps to Dumbird
   13. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   14. Bot opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
   15. Resolution phase occurs (Swap happens first, then Tackle)
   16. Human player chooses "Attack"
   17. Human player chooses "Tackle" skill
   18. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   19. Bot opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
   20. Resolution phase occurs (random order due to same speed)
   21. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene (assuming one Dumbird faints)

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This test covers a full play-through of the MainGameScene, including attacks, swaps, and the final transition to the MainMenuScene. It checks various aspects of the game logic, such as creature HP changes, swapping, and the order of actions in the resolution phase.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected a scene transition to "MainMenuScene" at the end, but instead received another choice request. Let's analyze the sequence of events:

The test progressed through several turns of combat, with both players attacking and swapping creatures. The last few relevant lines of the stdout are:

# Excerpt ID: a34797ba-462a-47e7-aba6-dfb66d3cedd3
```
Default Player's Dumbird used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Dumbird took 5 damage!"}
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This indicates that after the last round of attacks, the game is continuing and asking the human player for another choice instead of transitioning to the MainMenuScene as expected.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumed that after a certain number of turns, one of the Dumbirds would faint, ending the battle. However, the actual game logic continues the battle as long as both players have creatures with HP remaining.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify our test to continue the battle until one player's creatures are all defeated. We should:

1. Remove the assumption that the battle ends after a fixed number of turns.
2. Continue making choices for both players until we see a transition to the MainMenuScene.
3. Add a safety check to prevent an infinite loop in case the battle doesn't end as expected.

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of a fixed sequence of actions, we'll need to continue the battle until one player wins. This means the number of turns in the test will be variable.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the changes implemented:

                    if mock_transition.called:

                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def human_player(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("human_player")
        player.creatures = [
            Creature.from_prototype_id("bubwool"),

        ]
        player.active_creature = player.creatures[0]

        bot = app.create_bot("basic_opponent")
        bot.creatures = [
            Creature.from_prototype_id("scizard"),
            Creature.from_prototype_id("dumbird")
        ]
        bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

    def test_main_game_scene_playthrough(self, app, human_player, bot_player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, human_player)
        scene.bot = bot_player
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        max_turns = 100  # Safety check to prevent infinite loop
        for _ in range(max_turns):
            event = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
            if isinstance(event, list):
                attack_choice = find_button(event, "Attack")
                runner.make_choice(attack_choice)

                skill_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
                tackle_choice = find_select_thing(skill_choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle_choice)

            event = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            if isinstance(event, list):
                attack_choice = find_button(event, "Attack")
                runner.make_choice(attack_choice)

                skill_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
                tackle_choice = find_select_thing(skill_choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle_choice)

            # Check if any player's creatures are all fainted
            if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures) or \
               all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.bot.creatures):
                break
        else:
            pytest.fail("Battle did not end within the expected number of turns")

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Additional assertions to verify the battle outcome
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures) or 
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.bot.creatures))
        assert (any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures) or 
                any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.bot.creatures))
```

This modified test continues the battle until one player's creatures are all defeated or until a maximum number of turns is reached. It then verifies that the scene transitions to the MainMenuScene and that the battle outcome is as expected (one player has all creatures fainted, the other has at least one creature with HP remaining).

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

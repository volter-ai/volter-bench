## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected to receive a choice event for the bot player (Basic Opponent) after the human player's turn, but instead received another choice event for the human player (Default Player). This indicates that the test's expectation of alternating turns between the human player and the bot player was not met by the actual game logic.

Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: f9ba8b86-6fbe-4e44-8167-43a49e71d87c
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard used Tackle!"}
Default Player's Bubwool took 8 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected the next choice to be for the bot player, but it was for the human player again. This is because the game logic executes both players' actions in a single turn before asking for the next choices, rather than alternating between players for each action.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes that after each player's action, it will immediately be the other player's turn. However, the actual game logic processes both players' actions before starting a new turn.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify our test to match the actual game logic. Instead of expecting alternating turns between the human player and the bot player, we should:

1. Handle both players' choices for attack and skill selection in a single iteration.
2. After both players have made their choices, we should expect the results of both actions to be processed.
3. Then, we should expect a new turn to start with choices for the human player again.

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of alternating between human and bot players for each action, we'll handle both players' actions in each iteration of the test loop. This means we'll need to make choices for both players before expecting the next set of choices.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the changes implemented:

        # Expect the battle to end after this turn
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Additional assertions to verify the battle outcome
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures)
        assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.bot.creatures)
```

This modified test now correctly handles the game logic where both players make their choices before the next turn starts. It explicitly goes through five turns, expecting the human player's first creature to faint at the start of the fifth turn. After the fifth turn, it expects the battle to end with a transition to the MainMenuScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here's the updated `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the new tests:

```

This updated file includes three new tests in addition to the existing random run test:

1. `test_player_wins`: Simulates a scenario where the player wins by reducing the bot's creature's HP to 0.
2. `test_player_loses`: Simulates a scenario where the player loses by having their creature's HP reduced to 0.
3. `test_multiple_turns`: Simulates a longer battle with multiple turns, ending with the player winning.

Each test follows the guidelines provided, using the ThreadedSceneRunner to manage the game flow and explicitly checking each step of the play-through. The tests end with either a transition to the MainMenuScene or a quit_whole_game event, as required.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

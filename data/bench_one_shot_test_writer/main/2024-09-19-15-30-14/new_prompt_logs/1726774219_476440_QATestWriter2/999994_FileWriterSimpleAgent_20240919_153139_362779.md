## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the tests are expecting the round count to be 1 after the first round, but the actual game logic increments the round count before playing each round. This is evident from the captured stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 63da1ac7-11bb-4d1d-a781-c68157c1b6d2
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test is asserting:

# Excerpt ID: b1a36396-3864-425d-af28-196d61297f8c
```python
assert scene.rounds == 1
```

But the actual value is 2. This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game is designed to increment the round count at the beginning of each round, not at the end.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this, we need to adjust our tests to match the actual game flow. Instead of expecting the round count to be 1 after the first round, we should expect it to be 2. We'll need to update all the assertions related to the round count in our tests.

The expected gameplay trace will change to reflect this order of events:
1. Game starts, round is set to 1
2. First round is played
3. Round is incremented to 2
4. Second round is played (if necessary)
5. Round is incremented to 3 (if a third round is played)

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the corrected logic:

```

These changes ensure that we're correctly asserting the round count after each round of play. The tests now accurately reflect the game's logic and should pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

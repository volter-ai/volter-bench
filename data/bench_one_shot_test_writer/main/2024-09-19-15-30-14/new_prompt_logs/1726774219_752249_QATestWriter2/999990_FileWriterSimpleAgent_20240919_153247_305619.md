## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The error message indicates that there's an ImportError in the test file. Specifically, it's trying to import 'patch' from 'mini_game_engine.engine.lib', but 'patch' is not defined in that module. This is an implementation error in the test file.

The relevant part of the error message is:

# Excerpt ID: 14ef6c93-9233-4043-b8ad-5d8a4bb1d711
```
main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py:5: in <module>
    from mini_game_engine.engine.lib import HumanListener, patch
E   ImportError: cannot import name 'patch' from 'mini_game_engine.engine.lib' ([REDACT]/volter-monorepo/packages/mge2/mini_game_engine/engine/lib.py)
```

This error is caused by a misunderstanding of where the 'patch' function comes from. It's typically part of the 'unittest.mock' module in Python's standard library, not from our game engine.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to remove the import of 'patch' from 'mini_game_engine.engine.lib' and instead import it from the correct module, 'unittest.mock'. We also need to remove any usage of 'patch' in our tests, as per the guidelines that state we cannot mock or patch methods other than what is mocked by ThreadedSceneRunner.

The expected gameplay trace doesn't change, but we need to adjust our test implementation to follow the guidelines more closely.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the corrected imports and adhering more closely to the guidelines:

This updated version removes the 'patch' import and usage, and follows the guidelines more closely by using the ThreadedSceneRunner for all game events and choices.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

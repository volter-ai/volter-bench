## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the tests are asserting the initial state of the `rounds` attribute incorrectly. Let's look at the captured stdout for the first failing test:

# Excerpt ID: efcda55a-5a80-4082-a872-83de15eb42a5
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test is asserting that `scene.rounds == 1` immediately after creating the scene and starting the game. However, the game logic initializes the `rounds` attribute to 0 in the constructor and increments it at the beginning of each round. This is why we see "Round 1" in the stdout before the test assertion fails.

The relevant part of the test code is:

# Excerpt ID: 642ccb27-c285-4404-a004-9ad61e5bc04b
```python
scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
runner.start_game(scene)

# Initial state
assert scene.rounds == 1  # This assertion fails
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that the round counter starts at 1, but in reality, it's initialized to 0 and incremented at the beginning of each round.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to adjust our assertions to match the actual game flow. Instead of asserting the round count immediately after creating the scene, we should wait for the first round to start before making assertions about the game state.

The expected gameplay trace should change to reflect this:
1. Create the scene and start the game
2. Wait for the first player choice event (which indicates the start of Round 1)
3. Assert initial state (rounds = 1)
4. Make choices for player and bot
5. Assert scores and next round (rounds = 2)
6. Repeat steps 4-5 for subsequent rounds
7. Assert final state and transition

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the corrected logic:

```

These changes should resolve the issues with the tests and correctly match the game's logic, where the round counter is incremented at the beginning of each round.

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected a scene transition to "MainMenuScene" at the end, but instead received another choice request. This indicates that the battle didn't end as expected. Let's analyze the sequence of events:

The test progressed as expected until the bot's Dumbird fainted. After that:

# Excerpt ID: 89e4a0f3-9cb5-4166-b31e-fd072baed675
```
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Dumbird fainted!"}
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Creature(scizard))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Creature(scizard))
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Basic Opponent sent out Scizard!'}
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected the battle to end after the bot's Dumbird fainted and Scizard was sent out. However, the game continued, allowing the human player to make another attack.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that after one Dumbird fainted, the battle would immediately end. However, the game logic allows the battle to continue as long as both players have creatures with non-zero HP.

2. Solution:

To fix this, we need to adjust our test to continue the battle until one player has no more creatures with non-zero HP. We should modify the test to:

1. Continue the battle loop until we detect that all creatures of one player have fainted.
2. After each turn, check if all creatures of either player have fainted.
3. If all creatures of one player have fainted, expect the scene transition to "MainMenuScene".

The expected gameplay trace will change to include more turns until one player's team is completely defeated.

3. Writing the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def human_player(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("human_player")
        player.creatures = [

        ]
        bot.active_creature = bot.creatures[0]
        return bot

    def test_main_game_scene_full_playthrough(self, app, human_player, bot_player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, human_player)
        scene.bot = bot_player
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        while True:
            # Human player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
            attack_choice = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_choice)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
            tackle_choice = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle_choice)

            # Bot player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            attack_choice = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_choice)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            bot_skill_choice = choices[0]  # Choose the first available skill
            runner.make_choice(bot_skill_choice)

            # Check if battle has ended
            if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures):
                break
            if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures):
                break

            # If a creature has fainted, there will be a forced swap
            if human_player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
                swap_choice = choices[0]  # Only one choice available for forced swap
                runner.make_choice(swap_choice)

            if bot_player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
                swap_choice = choices[0]  # Only one choice available for forced swap
                runner.make_choice(swap_choice)

        # Battle ends, transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Check final state
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures) or
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures))
```

This updated version of the test file should resolve the issue by continuing the battle until one player's team is completely defeated, at which point it correctly expects the transition to the MainMenuScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

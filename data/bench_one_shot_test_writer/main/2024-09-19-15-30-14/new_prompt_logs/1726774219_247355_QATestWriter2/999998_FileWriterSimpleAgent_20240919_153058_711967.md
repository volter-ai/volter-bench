## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. I'll add these tests to the existing file `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`.

Play-through description:

1. Setup:
   - Create a human player with Bubwool (water-type) and Dumbird (normal-type)
   - Create a bot opponent with Scizard (fire-type) and Dumbird (normal-type)

2. Play-through steps:
   1. Human player chooses "Attack"
   2. Human player chooses "Tackle" skill
   3. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   4. Bot opponent chooses "Fireball" skill
   5. Resolution phase occurs (Bubwool should go first due to higher speed)
   6. Human player chooses "Attack"
   7. Human player chooses "Lick" skill
   8. Bot opponent chooses "Swap"
   9. Bot opponent swaps to Dumbird
   10. Resolution phase occurs (Swap happens first, then Lick is used)
   11. Human player chooses "Swap"
   12. Human player swaps to Dumbird
   13. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   14. Bot opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
   15. Resolution phase occurs (Swap happens first, then Tackle is used)
   16. Human player chooses "Attack"
   17. Human player chooses "Tackle" skill
   18. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   19. Bot opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
   20. Resolution phase occurs (random order due to same speed)
   21. Repeat steps 16-20 until one Dumbird faints
   22. Losing player is forced to swap
   23. Winning player chooses "Attack"
   24. Winning player chooses "Tackle" skill
   25. Losing player's last creature faints
   26. Battle ends, transition to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

```

This test simulates a full play-through of the MainGameScene, covering various scenarios such as attacking, swapping creatures, and the battle ending. It checks the state of the creatures after each action and ensures that the scene transitions correctly at the end of the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

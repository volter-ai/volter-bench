## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected a scene transition to "MainMenuScene" at the end, but instead received another choice request. Let's analyze the sequence of events:

The test progressed through several turns of combat, with both players attacking and swapping creatures. The last few relevant events were:

# Excerpt ID: a58af157-6105-497e-bfa0-2c3fe5dd0bb8
```
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Dumbird fainted!"}
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Creature(scizard))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Creature(scizard))
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': 'Basic Opponent sent out Scizard!'}
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expected the battle to end after the bot's Dumbird fainted and it swapped to Scizard. However, the game continued, allowing the human player to make another attack.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that the battle would end immediately after one player's creature fainted and they were forced to swap. However, the actual game logic allows the battle to continue as long as both players have creatures available.

2. Solution description:

To fix this issue, we need to modify the test to continue the battle until one player has no more creatures available. We'll need to simulate more turns of combat until we reach that point. The expected gameplay trace will change to include more turns of combat after the bot swaps to Scizard.

3. Solution implementation:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

            if scene.player.active_creature.hp == 0:

        # Battle ends, transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This updated test continues the battle until one player has no more creatures available. It handles forced swaps when a creature faints and only expects the transition to MainMenuScene after the battle has concluded. This should resolve the issue and make the test pass.

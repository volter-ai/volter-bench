## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the issue and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

Looking at the captured stdout for the `test_turn_order` test, we can see:

# Excerpt ID: 027af7d6-f77f-4f66-8760-7a1435ecb5e2
```
Battle start!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
```

The test expected two full turns to be completed, but the stdout shows only one choice being made. The assertion `assert scene.player_creature.hp < initial_player_hp` failed because the player's HP didn't change. This indicates that the game logic is not progressing as expected in the test.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that after making choices for both the player and the foe, the turn would be resolved immediately. However, the game logic seems to be waiting for both players to make their choices before resolving the turn.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to adjust our test to match the actual game logic. Instead of checking HP changes after each individual choice, we should make choices for both players and then check for HP changes. We also need to ensure that we're correctly handling all the choice events that the game presents.

Here's how we can modify the test:

1. Make choices for both the player and the foe before checking HP changes.
2. Continue the loop until we see a scene transition or the game ends.
3. Check HP changes after both players have made their choices.
4. Remove the fixed number of iterations and instead use a while loop that continues until the battle ends.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file with the necessary changes:

            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:

                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")

                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

        while True:
            try:
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
                tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle)

                runner.make_choice(tackle)
            except TimeoutError:
                break

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0

    def test_turn_order(self, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        initial_player_hp = scene.player_creature.hp
        initial_foe_hp = scene.foe_creature.hp

        turn_count = 0
        while True:
            try:
                # Player's turn
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
                tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle)

                # Foe's turn
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
                tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle)

                turn_count += 1

                # Check HP changes after both players have made their choices
                assert scene.player_creature.hp < initial_player_hp, f"Player HP didn't decrease after turn {turn_count}"
                assert scene.foe_creature.hp < initial_foe_hp, f"Foe HP didn't decrease after turn {turn_count}"

                initial_player_hp = scene.player_creature.hp
                initial_foe_hp = scene.foe_creature.hp

                if scene.player_creature.hp <= 0 or scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0:
                    break

            except TimeoutError:
                break

        assert turn_count > 0, "No turns were completed"
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes address the issues in the `test_turn_order` function while maintaining the integrity of the other tests. The main modifications are:

1. We now use a while loop instead of a fixed number of iterations, allowing the test to continue until the battle ends.
2. We make choices for both the player and the foe before checking HP changes.
3. We check for HP changes after both players have made their choices, which aligns with the actual game logic.
4. We added a turn counter to ensure that at least one turn is completed.
5. We break the loop if either creature's HP reaches zero or if we encounter a TimeoutError.

These changes should make the test more robust and accurately reflect the game's logic as described in the architecture document.

## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the tests I want to write and then implement them in the `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py` file. Here are the tests I propose:

1. Test a full battle where the player wins:
   - Initialize the scene with predetermined HP values
   - Make choices for both player and foe
   - Verify that damage is dealt correctly
   - Ensure the battle ends when the foe's HP reaches 0
   - Check that the scene transitions to MainMenuScene with a win message

2. Test a full battle where the player loses:
   - Similar to the first test, but with the player losing
   - Verify the correct lose message and scene transition

3. Test the correct order of turns:
   - Ensure that the player and foe alternate in making choices
   - Verify that skills are resolved in the correct order

Now, I'll implement these tests in the file:

        assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

            # Player's turn

            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check that both skills are resolved
            assert len(scene.player_skill_queue) == 0
            assert len(scene.foe_skill_queue) == 0

        # The battle should still be ongoing
        assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0
```

This implementation includes the existing random runner test and adds three new tests as described earlier. The tests use the ThreadedSceneRunner to control the flow of the game and verify the correct behavior of the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

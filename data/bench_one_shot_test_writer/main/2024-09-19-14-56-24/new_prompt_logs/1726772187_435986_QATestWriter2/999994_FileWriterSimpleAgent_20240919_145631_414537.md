## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The captured stdout shows the following sequence of events:
# Excerpt ID: 8ab9228e-b160-4e63-abcf-d74e7d817c07
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(fireball))
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard used Fireball!"}
Default Player's Bubwool took 2 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The error occurs because the test expects the battle to end and transition to the MainMenuScene after a certain number of turns, but instead, it receives another choice request. This indicates that the test misinterpreted the game logic. The battle is continuing because neither player has lost all their creatures yet.

The relevant part of the code causing this error is:
# Excerpt ID: 053c8031-37aa-49cd-8fcc-7faf4b682801
```python
# Battle ends, player loses
assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game is not ending as quickly as the test expects, and the battle is continuing.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to match the actual game logic. Instead of expecting the battle to end after a fixed number of turns, we should continue the battle until one player loses all their creatures. We don't need to change the starting point of the logic, but we need to update our expectations of the game flow.

The gameplay trace will change significantly. We need to continue the battle, making choices for both players, until we see that one player has lost all their creatures. Then we can expect the transition to the MainMenuScene.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: b95c28c4-fba0-4078-a8c3-d8f47881e0d7

            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for the complex MainGameScene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):

                else:

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    @pytest.fixture
    def main_game_scene(self, app, player):
        return MainGameScene(app, player)

    def test_main_game_scene_full_battle(self, app, player, main_game_scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(main_game_scene)

        # Initial state check
        assert player.active_creature.prototype_id == "bubwool"
        assert main_game_scene.bot.active_creature.prototype_id == "scizard"

        while True:
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            skill = find_select_thing(choices, choices[0].thing.prototype_id)  # Choose the first available skill
            runner.make_choice(skill)

            # Bot's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
            skill = find_select_thing(choices, choices[0].thing.prototype_id)  # Choose the first available skill
            runner.make_choice(skill)

            # Check if the battle has ended
            try:
                scene_name = runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
                assert scene_name == "MainMenuScene"
                break
            except ValueError:
                # Battle hasn't ended, continue to next turn
                pass

            # If a creature has fainted, we need to swap
            if player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
                new_creature = find_select_thing(choices, choices[0].thing.prototype_id)  # Choose the first available creature
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)

            if main_game_scene.bot.active_creature.hp == 0:
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
                new_creature = find_select_thing(choices, choices[0].thing.prototype_id)  # Choose the first available creature
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)

        # Final state check
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in player.creatures) or all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in main_game_scene.bot.creatures)
```

The main changes are:
1. Replaced the fixed sequence of turns with a while loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. Added checks for creature fainting and swapping.
3. Used a try-except block to check for the transition to MainMenuScene after each turn.
4. Updated the final state check to assert that either the player or the bot has lost all their creatures.

These changes should align the test with the actual game logic and resolve the ValueError we encountered. The test now accurately simulates a full battle until one player loses all their creatures.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

1. Player wins 2 rounds in a row and chooses to play again:
   - Player chooses Rock, Bot chooses Scissors (Player wins)
   - Player chooses Paper, Bot chooses Rock (Player wins)
   - Player chooses "Play Again"

2. Bot wins 2 rounds in a row and player chooses to quit:
   - Player chooses Scissors, Bot chooses Rock (Bot wins)
   - Player chooses Paper, Bot chooses Scissors (Bot wins)
   - Player chooses "Quit"

3. Game goes to 3 rounds with a tie, player wins, and chooses to quit:
   - Player chooses Rock, Bot chooses Rock (Tie)
   - Player chooses Paper, Bot chooses Rock (Player wins)
   - Player chooses Scissors, Bot chooses Paper (Player wins)
   - Player chooses "Quit"

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

```

This file includes the original `TestMainGameSceneRandomRun` class unchanged, and adds a new `TestMainGameScene` class with three test methods corresponding to the play-throughs described earlier. Each test method simulates a full play-through of the game, checking the game state at each step and ensuring the correct transitions occur at the end of the game.

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected a scene transition event after the first round of combat, but instead received another choice request. This indicates that the battle was continuing rather than ending as the test expected. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and the corresponding code:

Stdout:
# Excerpt ID: a3eea722-b8e3-4e97-b380-139e0bd3b631
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(fireball))
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard used Fireball!"}
Default Player's Bubwool took 2 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 53f3bbd2-4c2b-4259-af86-fcdc22a2e4aa
```python
# Check if battle has ended
try:
    scene_transition = runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
    assert scene_transition == "MainMenuScene"
    battle_ongoing = False
except TimeoutError:
    # Battle continues
    pass
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test expected the battle to end after a single round, but the game is designed for multiple rounds until one player's creatures are all defeated. The difference between the expected and actual behavior is that the game continues with another choice request instead of transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to modify the test to handle multiple rounds of combat until the battle actually ends. We should:

1. Remove the while loop and instead explicitly handle each round of combat.
2. Continue the battle until we either get a scene transition or all creatures of one player are defeated.
3. After each round, check the HP of both players' creatures to determine if the battle should continue.
4. Only expect a scene transition when one player has no more creatures with HP > 0.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include multiple rounds of combat, with each round explicitly handled in the test.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the necessary changes:

    def test_main_game_scene_full_battle(self, app, human_player, bot_player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, human_player)

            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            bot_skill = random.choice([choice for choice in choices if isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Skill)])
            runner.make_choice(bot_skill)

            # Check if any creature fainted
            if human_player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
                new_creature = next(choice for choice in choices if isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Creature))
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)
                human_player.active_creature = new_creature.thing

            if bot_player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
                new_creature = next(choice for choice in choices if isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Creature))
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)
                bot_player.active_creature = new_creature.thing

            # Check if battle has ended
            human_creatures_alive = any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in human_player.creatures)
            bot_creatures_alive = any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)

            if not human_creatures_alive or not bot_creatures_alive:
                scene_transition = runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
                assert scene_transition == "MainMenuScene"
                battle_ended = True

        # Determine winner
        human_lost = all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures)
        bot_lost = all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)

        assert human_lost != bot_lost, "One player should win and one should lose"

        if human_lost:
            assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)
        else:
            assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in human_player.creatures)
```

This solution addresses the issue by:
1. Continuing the battle until one player has no more creatures with HP > 0.
2. Explicitly handling each round of combat, including creature swaps when a creature faints.
3. Only expecting a scene transition when the battle has actually ended.
4. Verifying the final state of both players' creatures to determine the winner.

These changes make the test more robust and accurately reflect the actual game logic, including multiple rounds of combat and creature swaps during the battle.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1

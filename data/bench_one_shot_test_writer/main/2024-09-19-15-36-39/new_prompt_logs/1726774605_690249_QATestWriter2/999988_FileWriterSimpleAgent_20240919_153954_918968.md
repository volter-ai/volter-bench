## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue in the `test_multiple_turns` test is that it's expecting a scene transition after each player's turn, which is not how the game logic is implemented. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and the corresponding code:

# Excerpt ID: d6dea854-7cf5-4ebc-adab-e3b20a01363a
```
Battle start!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
```

The test expects a scene transition after the player's turn, but instead, it receives another wait_for_choice event for the foe's turn. This is correct according to the game logic described in the markdown:

# Excerpt ID: 9bcdb3d3-8271-428b-a794-0089f7be62c3
```markdown
The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase
```

The error occurs because the test doesn't account for the foe's turn before checking for a scene transition. The test tries to dequeue a scene_transition event immediately after the player's choice, but instead receives a choice_request event for the foe, causing the ValueError.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed the battle could end after each player's turn, but the actual game logic requires both the player and foe to make choices before resolving the turn and potentially ending the battle.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify the test to account for both the player's and foe's turns before checking for a battle end. We should:

1. Make a choice for the player.
2. Make a choice for the foe.
3. Check if the battle has ended by trying to dequeue a scene transition event.
4. If the battle hasn't ended, continue to the next turn.
5. If the battle has ended, verify that it ended correctly (correct winner, correct HP values).

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of checking for a battle end after each player's turn, we'll check after both the player and foe have made their choices. This approach will accurately reflect the actual game logic.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated `test_main_game_scene.py` file with the necessary changes:

            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):

                except TransitionFromScene:

                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    @pytest.fixture
    def scene(self, app, player):
        return MainGameScene(app, player)

    def test_player_wins(self, app, player, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        initial_player_hp = scene.player_creature.hp
        initial_foe_hp = scene.foe_creature.hp
        tackle_damage = scene.player_creature.skills[0].damage

        rounds_to_win = math.ceil(initial_foe_hp / tackle_damage)

        for _ in range(rounds_to_win):
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0

    def test_player_loses(self, app, player, scene):

        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Foe's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)

    def test_multiple_turns(self, app, player, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        initial_player_hp = scene.player_creature.hp
        initial_foe_hp = scene.foe_creature.hp
        tackle_damage = scene.player_creature.skills[0].damage

        max_rounds = 5
        battle_ended = False

        for i in range(max_rounds):
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check if battle ended after both turns
            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                battle_ended = True
                break
            except TimeoutError:
                pass

            # Assert HP values after each full round
            assert scene.player_creature.hp == initial_player_hp - (i + 1) * tackle_damage
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp == initial_foe_hp - (i + 1) * tackle_damage

        assert battle_ended, "Battle did not end within the expected number of turns"
        
        # Final assertions
        if scene.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0
        else:
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0
            assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
```

This updated test now correctly accounts for both the player's and foe's turns before checking for a battle end. It makes choices for both the player and the foe, then checks for a scene transition. If no transition occurs, it continues to the next round. This approach accurately reflects the game logic as described in the markdown.

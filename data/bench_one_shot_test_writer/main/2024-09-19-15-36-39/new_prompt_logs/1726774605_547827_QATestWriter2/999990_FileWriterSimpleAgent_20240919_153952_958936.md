## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed when trying to dequeue a wait_for_choice event for the bot player after the third turn. Here's the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: c2014707-ea90-4fbc-b9b1-33a0f8ad843b
```
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard used Fireball!"}
Default Player's Bubwool took 2 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The error occurred in this line of the test:

# Excerpt ID: c5f91197-2d94-4f15-9fa9-1487005bdca0
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
```

The test expected the bot player to make a choice, but instead, it was the human player's turn again. This is a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that after three turns, the bot's Scizard would faint and need to swap, but the actual game logic shows that the battle is continuing with the human player's turn.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to match the actual game logic. Instead of assuming the bot's Scizard will faint after three turns, we should continue the battle until one of the creatures actually faints. We'll need to modify the test to handle an unknown number of turns until a creature faints.

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of a fixed number of turns, we'll need to loop through turns until we detect that a creature has fainted (indicated by a swap choice being presented).

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

            if isinstance(choices[0], SelectThing) and choices[0].thing.__class__.__name__ == "Creature":
                # Bot needs to swap, Scizard has fainted
                break
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            fireball_skill = find_select_thing(choices, "fireball")
            runner.make_choice(fireball_skill)

        # Bot player swaps to Dumbird
        dumbird = find_select_thing(choices, "dumbird")
        runner.make_choice(dumbird)

        # Continue the battle until one player loses
        while True:
            # Human player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
            if isinstance(choices[0], SelectThing) and choices[0].thing.__class__.__name__ == "Creature":
                # Human player needs to swap
                dumbird = find_select_thing(choices, "dumbird")
                runner.make_choice(dumbird)
            else:
                attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
                runner.make_choice(attack_button)

        # Assert that one player has lost all creatures
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures) or
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures))

        # Check for transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This solution removes the fixed number of turns and instead loops through the battle until a creature faints. It then continues the battle until one player loses all their creatures. This approach should accurately represent the game logic and adapt to different battle durations.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

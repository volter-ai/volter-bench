## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed when trying to dequeue a wait_for_choice event for the human player after the bot's Scizard fainted. Here's the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: a20679e0-ceb9-4413-8766-320acb7fdb9a
```
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard fainted!"}
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
```

The error occurred in this line of the test:

# Excerpt ID: ce0af9b7-b0b2-48fd-996c-b8aa8693e369
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
```

The test expected the human player to make a choice, but instead, it was the bot player's turn to choose a new creature. This is a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that after the bot's creature fainted, it would be the human player's turn again, but the actual game logic shows that the bot needs to choose a new creature immediately.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to match the actual game logic. After a creature faints, the owner of that creature needs to choose a new one immediately. We should modify the test to handle this scenario correctly.

The expected gameplay trace will change. After the bot's Scizard faints, we need to handle the bot's creature selection before continuing with the human player's turn.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        # Assert that one player has lost all creatures
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in human_player.creatures) or
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures))

        # Check for transition to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This solution removes the while loop and explicitly handles each turn of the battle. It correctly handles the scenario where the bot's Scizard faints and needs to be replaced immediately. The test now follows the actual game logic more closely and should pass without errors.

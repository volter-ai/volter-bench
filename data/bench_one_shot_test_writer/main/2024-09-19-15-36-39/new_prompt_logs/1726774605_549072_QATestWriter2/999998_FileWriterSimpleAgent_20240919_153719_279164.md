## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. I'll add these tests to the existing file `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`.

Play-through description:

1. Setup:
   - Create a human player with Bubwool (water-type) and Dumbird (normal-type)
   - Create a bot opponent with Scizard (fire-type) and Dumbird (normal-type)

2. Play-through steps:
   1. Human player chooses "Attack"
   2. Human player chooses "Tackle" skill
   3. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   4. Bot opponent chooses "Fireball" skill
   5. Resolution phase occurs (Bubwool should go first due to higher speed)
   6. Human player chooses "Swap"
   7. Human player swaps to Dumbird
   8. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   9. Bot opponent chooses "Tackle" skill
   10. Resolution phase occurs (Scizard should go first due to swap)
   11. Human player chooses "Attack"
   12. Human player chooses "Tackle" skill
   13. Bot opponent chooses "Attack"
   14. Bot opponent chooses "Fireball" skill
   15. Resolution phase occurs (Dumbird should go first due to higher speed)
   16. Repeat steps 11-15 until Dumbird faints
   17. Human player is forced to swap back to Bubwool
   18. Repeat steps 1-5 until Bubwool faints
   19. Battle ends, human player loses

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

```

This test simulates a full battle scenario in the MainGameScene, covering various aspects of the gameplay including attacking, swapping creatures, and the battle resolution. It checks that the game state changes correctly after each action and that the battle ends as expected when all of the human player's creatures faint.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test failed at the assertion `assert bot_player.active_creature.hp < initial_bot_hp`. The captured stdout shows that the human player's Bubwool used Tackle on the bot player's Scizard, but the Scizard's HP didn't decrease. Here's the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 112f83bd-eb60-4264-a35a-e69745d6f9b0
```
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
```

This indicates that the Scizard should have taken 5 damage, but the test shows that its HP remained unchanged at 35. This error is likely caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes that the creature's HP is updated immediately after the attack, but it seems that the HP might not be updated until the end of the resolution phase.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to check the HP after the entire resolution phase is complete. We should also add assertions to check both creatures' HP after each resolution phase. This will allow us to verify that the damage is being applied correctly.

The expected gameplay trace should change slightly. Instead of checking HP immediately after each attack, we'll check both creatures' HP after the resolution phase is complete.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        assert any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in bot_player.creatures)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes should resolve the issue by checking the HP of both creatures after each resolution phase, rather than immediately after each attack. This aligns better with the game's logic of updating HP at the end of each turn.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

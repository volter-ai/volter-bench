The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player uses their skills (rock, paper, scissors) against each other in a best of 3

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        HumanListener.random_mode = True

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()
```

Guidelines:
1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT remove the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes

Example:
```python {file path}
runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
runner.start_game(main_menu_scene)

choices = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x)

assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
```

Each of your tests should describe a full play-through of the scene. During the full play-through, different behaviors of the scene will be tested

Do the following in the same response:
First describes play-through(s) that will be simulated by the test. Try to accomplish the tests with as few play-throughs as possible
Secondly write the tests

You should add your tests to `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
Write out the whole file so I can copy-paste

IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response
__________________
Role: assistant
Content: I'll describe two play-throughs that will cover different scenarios in the MainGameScene, and then write the corresponding tests.

Play-through 1:
1. Human player wins the first two rounds (Rock vs Scissors, Paper vs Rock)
2. Game ends after two rounds with the player winning
3. Player chooses to play again

Play-through 2:
1. Bot wins the first round (Scissors vs Paper)
2. Human player wins the second round (Rock vs Scissors)
3. Bot wins the third round (Paper vs Rock)
4. Game ends after three rounds with the bot winning
5. Player chooses to quit

Now, I'll write the tests for these play-throughs:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 1
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 3
```

These tests cover the two play-throughs described earlier, testing different game outcomes and player choices. The tests use the ThreadedSceneRunner to simulate the game flow and assert the expected behavior and state of the MainGameScene.

Think carefully and review the architecture doc and the game logic. 



1. First describe what went wrong:

Carefully look at the captured stdout for this test. Explain step-by-step the sequence of events which happened in the stdout and compare it to the mocked choices. Show the relevant part of the stdout and all the lines of the code that are related to this error, describe whether this error is caused by a bad implementation of the test, a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, or a departure of game logic from the architecture. Then describe the specific difference between the expected and the actual and why the difference is there



2. Describe solution

Remember you cannot mock or patch the methods of the game scene other than what is mocked by ThreadedSceneRunner. So if you need to change the test, describe how you can solve this problem without mocking the game scene's methods. You might have to start the logic at an earlier part of the code and 'play' the game until the point you're interested in testing. Describe the exact changes you would make, be very concrete. Does the expected gameplay trace change? If so describe the change



3. Write the solution

Describe the change you will make and write them



Remember the following guidelines:

1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT remove the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes



Write out the file(s) in the format:

```{filetype} {filepath}

{content}

```



Write out the whole file(s) so I can copy-paste.



IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response

Role: assistant
Content: 1. What went wrong:

The tests are failing because they're not properly handling the game flow. The captured stdout shows:

```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

This indicates that the game is starting correctly, but the test is not properly handling the initial "Welcome" message. The test is trying to dequeue a wait_for_choice event for the welcome message, which doesn't exist, causing a TimeoutError.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes there's a choice event for the welcome message, but the game scene only shows text for the welcome message without waiting for a choice.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this, we need to remove the dequeue for the welcome message and start directly with the first round's choice. We also need to handle the bot's choices properly by dequeuing random calls for the bot's choices.

The expected gameplay trace should change to:
1. Start the game
2. Handle the first round's choice
3. Handle the bot's choice (random call)
4. Continue with subsequent rounds
5. Handle the final choice (Play Again or Quit)

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        HumanListener.random_mode = True

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture

    def test_player_wins_two_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("rock")]

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_again = find_button(choices, "Play Again")
        runner.make_choice(play_again)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 2
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 2

    def test_bot_wins_two_out_of_three_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 3
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("paper")]

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 1
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 3
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the dequeue for the welcome message in both tests.
2. Kept the logic for handling rounds and choices the same.
3. Ensured that we're properly handling the bot's choices by dequeuing random calls.

These changes should resolve the TimeoutError and allow the tests to run correctly, following the actual game logic.

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is expecting a random call event for the bot's choice, but instead it's getting a choice_request event. This is because the bot's choice is handled through the same _wait_for_choice method as the player's choice, not through a direct random call.

Relevant stdout:

```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 3c9bc630-070a-4939-b56b-8dc3bfa965e6
```python
# Round 1
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
runner.make_choice(rock)

random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes the bot's choice is made through a random call, but the game scene is actually using _wait_for_choice for both the player and the bot.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this, we need to handle the bot's choice in the same way as the player's choice. Instead of expecting a random call, we should expect another wait_for_choice event for the bot. We'll need to dequeue the bot's choice and make a choice for it as well.

The expected gameplay trace should change to:
1. Start the game
2. Handle the player's choice for the first round
3. Handle the bot's choice for the first round
4. Repeat steps 2-3 for subsequent rounds
5. Handle the final choice (Play Again or Quit)

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: a839ba7e-7178-4130-8a7a-bb7fdad1c84e

        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)

        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 2

    def test_bot_wins_two_out_of_three_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1

        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        paper = find_select_thing(bot_choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        # Round 3
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(bot_choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        # Game end

        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 1
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 3
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the `dequeue_random_call()` expectations.
2. Added `dequeue_wait_for_choice()` and `make_choice()` for the bot in each round.
3. Updated the assertions to match the expected game state after each round.

These changes should resolve the ValueError and allow the tests to run correctly, following the actual game logic.

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not correctly simulating the game's flow. Let's look at the relevant stdout and code for the `test_game_flow` test:

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: a05e25f6-319f-4367-8153-ee00e00e6acd
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: d025833c-7808-4010-b5eb-ef131167efde
```python
# Player's turn
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
player_choice = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
runner.make_choice(player_choice)

# Bot's turn
bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
bot_choice = runner.dequeue_random_call()['args'][0]
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that there will be a random call event for the bot's choice, but in reality, the bot's choice is made by the BotListener, which is not using the `random` module directly. The `BotListener.on_wait_for_choice` method is using `random.choice`, but this is not captured by the `ThreadedSceneRunner`.

The specific difference is that the test expects a random call event for the bot's choice, but no such event is generated. Instead, the bot's choice is made within the `BotListener` and is returned directly as a choice event.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to work with the actual game logic:

1. Remove the expectation of a random call event for the bot's choice.
2. Instead, we should capture the bot's choice from the `wait_for_choice` event for the bot.
3. We need to handle both the player's and bot's choices before asserting the game state.

The expected gameplay trace should change to:
1. Start the game
2. Handle the player's choice for the first round
3. Handle the bot's choice for the first round
4. Assert the game state after the first round
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the second round
6. Handle the final choice (Play Again or Quit)
7. Assert the final game state

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: ac5a48b3-883b-4194-bb95-86d9ec87fd2a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_select_thing, find_button
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene
from main_game.models import Player, Skill

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        HumanListener.random_mode = True

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    def test_game_flow(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        for round in range(1, 3):
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            player_choice = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
            runner.make_choice(player_choice)

            # Bot's turn
            bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
            bot_choice = random.choice(bot_choices)
            runner.make_choice(bot_choice)

            # Determine the winner
            if player_choice.thing.display_name == bot_choice.thing.display_name:
                expected_result = "tie"
            elif (
                (player_choice.thing.display_name == "Rock" and bot_choice.thing.display_name == "Scissors") or
                (player_choice.thing.display_name == "Paper" and bot_choice.thing.display_name == "Rock") or
                (player_choice.thing.display_name == "Scissors" and bot_choice.thing.display_name == "Paper")
            ):
                expected_result = "player"
            else:
                expected_result = "bot"

            # Assert the game state
            assert scene.rounds == round
            assert scene.player_score + scene.bot_score <= round
            if expected_result == "player":
                assert scene.player_score > 0
            elif expected_result == "bot":
                assert scene.bot_score > 0

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_again = find_button(choices, "Play Again")
        runner.make_choice(play_again)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
        assert scene.rounds == 2
        assert scene.player_score + scene.bot_score <= 2
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the expectation of a random call event for the bot's choice.
2. Now we handle the bot's choice similarly to the player's choice, by dequeuing a wait_for_choice event and making a choice.
3. We use `random.choice` to simulate the bot's random selection, which is what the BotListener does internally.
4. The rest of the test logic remains the same, asserting the game state after each round and at the end of the game.

These changes should resolve the issues with the previous test and provide a more accurate simulation of the game's logic.

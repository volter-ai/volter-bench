## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

For the `test_normal_battle_flow` test:
The test runs through several turns of the battle correctly, but it fails when trying to dequeue the next wait_for_choice event after the player's Dumbird faints. The relevant part of the stdout is:

# Excerpt ID: ef8aa135-5efa-4fc6-ae3d-cccb0b67c2b5
```
Default Player's Dumbird fainted!
Default Player has no more creatures able to battle!
You lost the battle!
```

The test expects another choice event, but the battle has ended because the player has no more creatures. This is a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test should expect the battle to end when all of a player's creatures faint.

For the `test_forced_swap` test:
The test sets the player's active creature's HP to 0 and expects a forced swap. However, the captured stdout shows:

# Excerpt ID: 652c2d24-57bb-4c88-bce9-bf00d2c58239
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This indicates that the game is not immediately triggering a forced swap when the HP is set to 0. The test's expectation doesn't match the actual game logic. The game seems to only check for fainted creatures during the normal flow of the battle, not immediately when HP is changed.

2. Describe solution:

For `test_normal_battle_flow`:
We need to modify the test to expect the battle to end when all of a player's creatures faint. Instead of continuing the loop indefinitely, we should check for the battle end condition after each turn.

For `test_forced_swap`:
We need to change our approach. Instead of setting the HP to 0 directly, we should play through the battle until the creature's HP reaches 0 naturally. Then we can test the forced swap behavior.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include the full battle sequence leading up to the forced swap, and then verify the swap occurs correctly.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")

        # Verify that the battle continues (no transition to MainMenuScene)
        with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):
            runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
```

These changes address the issues in both tests. The `test_normal_battle_flow` now correctly handles the end of the battle, and the `test_forced_swap` plays through the battle until a forced swap occurs naturally, then verifies the correct behavior.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

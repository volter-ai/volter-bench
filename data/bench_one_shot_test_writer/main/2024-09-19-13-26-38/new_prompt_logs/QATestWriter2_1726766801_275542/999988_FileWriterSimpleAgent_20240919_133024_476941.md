## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue in both tests is that they don't account for the bot's turn after the player's creature faints and a forced swap occurs. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the `test_normal_battle_flow`:

# Excerpt ID: 7b03c809-1089-413e-a073-86728c6189df
```
Default Player's Bubwool fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))
Default Player sent out Dumbird!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

After the player's Bubwool faints, there's a forced swap to Dumbird. The test then expects the bot's turn, but instead, it gets another choice for the player. This is because the game logic continues with the player's turn after a forced swap, rather than switching to the bot's turn.

The error occurs in the `handle_turn` method:

# Excerpt ID: ae24f710-0c62-4461-9a8b-c047eb509772
```python
def handle_turn(self, runner, player):
    choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
    if any(isinstance(choice, Button) for choice in choices):
        attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
        runner.make_choice(attack_button)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        skill_choice = find_select_thing(choices, player.active_creature.skills[0].prototype_id)
        runner.make_choice(skill_choice)
    else:
        # Forced swap
        swap_choice = find_select_thing(choices, [c for c in player.creatures if c.hp > 0][0].prototype_id)
        runner.make_choice(swap_choice)
```

This method doesn't account for the game continuing with the player's turn after a forced swap. It's not a problem with the game logic, but rather a misinterpretation in the test implementation.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to modify the `handle_turn` method to continue handling the player's turn after a forced swap. We should also adjust the main loop in the tests to account for this behavior. The expected gameplay trace will change to include the player's turn immediately after a forced swap, before moving to the bot's turn.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for the complex MainGameScene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:

            if all(c.hp <= 0 for c in player.creatures) or all(c.hp <= 0 for c in main_game_scene.bot.creatures):
                battle_ended = True

        # Verify that the battle ends and transitions to the MainMenuScene

        assert player.active_creature != player.creatures[0]  # Should not be the original creature

        # Bot's turn
        self.handle_turn(runner, main_game_scene.bot)

        # Verify that the battle continues (no transition to MainMenuScene)
        with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):
            runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()

    def handle_turn(self, runner, player):
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        if any(isinstance(choice, Button) for choice in choices):
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            skill_choice = find_select_thing(choices, player.active_creature.skills[0].prototype_id)
            runner.make_choice(skill_choice)
        else:
            # Forced swap
            swap_choice = find_select_thing(choices, [c for c in player.creatures if c.hp > 0][0].prototype_id)
            runner.make_choice(swap_choice)
            
            # Continue with the player's turn after forced swap
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            skill_choice = find_select_thing(choices, player.active_creature.skills[0].prototype_id)
            runner.make_choice(skill_choice)
```

These changes should address the issues in both tests. The `handle_turn` method now correctly handles both normal turns and forced swaps, including the continuation of the player's turn after a forced swap. The `test_forced_swap` has been updated to expect the player's turn to continue after the forced swap, before moving to the bot's turn.

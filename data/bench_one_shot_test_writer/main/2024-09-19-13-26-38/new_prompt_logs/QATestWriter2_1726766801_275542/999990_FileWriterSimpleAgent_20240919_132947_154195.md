## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

For the `test_normal_battle_flow` test:
The test runs through several turns of the battle correctly, but it fails when trying to dequeue the next wait_for_choice event for the bot after the player's Bubwool faints. The relevant part of the stdout is:

# Excerpt ID: 25232082-cdb3-4beb-ad36-77ca2e39ac52
```
Default Player's Bubwool fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))
Default Player sent out Dumbird!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

The test expects a choice event for the bot, but instead, it gets another choice event for the player. This is because the game logic forces a swap for the player when their active creature faints, before continuing with the bot's turn. The test's logic doesn't account for this forced swap.

For the `test_forced_swap` test:
The test fails because it expects to find an "Attack" button in the choices after the player's active creature faints. However, the actual choices presented are for a forced swap:

# Excerpt ID: 0b423aba-7392-4562-b2c3-0e12985a2c16
```
Default Player's Bubwool fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
```

This indicates that the test's expectation doesn't match the actual game logic. The game immediately triggers a forced swap when a creature faints, rather than continuing with the normal turn flow.

2. Describe solution:

For both tests, we need to modify our approach to account for the forced swap that occurs when a creature faints. 

For `test_normal_battle_flow`:
We should add a check after each turn to see if a forced swap is required. If so, we should handle the swap before continuing with the next turn.

For `test_forced_swap`:
Instead of trying to find an "Attack" button after a creature faints, we should expect and handle the forced swap. Then we can verify that the battle continues with the new active creature.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include the forced swap when a creature faints, and then continue with the normal battle flow.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

    def test_forced_swap(self, app, player, main_game_scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(main_game_scene)

        # Play the battle until the player's active creature faints

        runner.make_choice(swap_choice)

        # Verify that the battle continues with the new active creature
        assert player.active_creature.hp > 0
        assert player.active_creature != player.creatures[0]  # Should not be the original creature

        # Player's turn after forced swap
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        assert any(isinstance(choice, Button) for choice in choices), "Expected Button choices after forced swap"
        attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
        runner.make_choice(attack_button)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        skill_choice = find_select_thing(choices, player.active_creature.skills[0].prototype_id)
        runner.make_choice(skill_choice)

        # Bot's turn
        self.handle_turn(runner, main_game_scene.bot)

        # Verify that the battle continues (no transition to MainMenuScene)
        with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):
            runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()

    def handle_turn(self, runner, player):
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        if any(isinstance(choice, Button) for choice in choices):
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)

            # Forced swap

            runner.make_choice(swap_choice)
```

These changes address the issues in both tests. The `handle_turn` method now correctly handles both normal turns and forced swaps. The `test_normal_battle_flow` uses this method for both player and bot turns, accounting for forced swaps. The `test_forced_swap` now correctly expects and handles the forced swap when a creature faints.

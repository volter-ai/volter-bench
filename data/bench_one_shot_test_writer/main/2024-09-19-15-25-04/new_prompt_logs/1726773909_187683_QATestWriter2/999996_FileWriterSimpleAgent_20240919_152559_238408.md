## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue in both tests is that they expect a scene transition to "MainMenuScene" immediately after the last player action, but the game logic continues to ask for more choices. This is evident from the captured stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 39a2ee79-cc4e-43ee-870f-0ee6ea598c25
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
```

This line appears after the last expected action in both tests, indicating that the game is asking for another choice instead of transitioning to the MainMenuScene.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the tests. The tests assume that the battle ends immediately after a certain number of turns, but the actual game logic continues until one creature's HP reaches zero.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to modify our tests to continue playing the game until a creature's HP reaches zero. We should:

1. Remove the fixed number of turns and instead use a loop to continue making choices until we see a scene transition.
2. After each choice, check the HP of both creatures to ensure the game state is as expected.
3. Use a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops in case of unexpected behavior.

The expected gameplay trace will change to accommodate variable-length battles that end when a creature's HP reaches zero.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file:

# Excerpt ID: f6d01d8a-d641-4ef4-ba47-c7410fe5dea5

            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:

                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_player_wins(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        foe = app.create_bot("default_player")

        for _ in range(max_turns):
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check if the battle has ended
            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                break
            except ValueError:
                # Battle hasn't ended, continue
                pass

            # Assert the HP after each round
            assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0

        else:
            pytest.fail("Battle did not end within the expected number of turns")

        # Final assertions
        assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 0

    def test_foe_wins(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.foe = foe
        scene.player_creature.hp = 5  # Set player's creature HP to 5

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        max_turns = 5
        for _ in range(max_turns):
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check if the battle has ended
            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                break
            except ValueError:
                # Battle hasn't ended, continue
                pass

            # Assert the HP after each round
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0

        else:
            pytest.fail("Battle did not end within the expected number of turns")

        # Final assertions
        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0
```

This solution modifies both test methods to continue the battle until a scene transition occurs or a maximum number of turns is reached. It also includes assertions to check the HP of both creatures after each round, ensuring that the game state is as expected throughout the battle.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

Play-through 1: Player wins
1. Set up the scene with player and foe creatures having 10 HP each
2. Player chooses "tackle" skill
3. Foe chooses "tackle" skill
4. Resolution phase occurs, both creatures lose 3 HP
5. Player chooses "tackle" skill
6. Foe chooses "tackle" skill
7. Resolution phase occurs, both creatures lose 3 HP
8. Player chooses "tackle" skill
9. Foe chooses "tackle" skill
10. Resolution phase occurs, both creatures lose 3 HP
11. Player chooses "tackle" skill
12. Foe chooses "tackle" skill
13. Resolution phase occurs, foe's creature HP reaches 0
14. Battle ends, player wins
15. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Play-through 2: Foe wins
1. Set up the scene with player's creature having 5 HP and foe's creature having 10 HP
2. Player chooses "tackle" skill
3. Foe chooses "tackle" skill
4. Resolution phase occurs, player's creature HP reaches 0
5. Battle ends, foe wins
6. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

        scene.foe = foe

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Foe's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 7
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 7

        # Player's turn

        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 4

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Foe's turn

        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 1
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 1

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_foe_wins(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.foe = foe
        scene.player_creature.hp = 5  # Set player's creature HP to 5

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Foe's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These tests cover the two play-throughs described earlier. The first test simulates a full battle where the player wins, and the second test simulates a scenario where the foe wins due to the player's creature starting with lower HP.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

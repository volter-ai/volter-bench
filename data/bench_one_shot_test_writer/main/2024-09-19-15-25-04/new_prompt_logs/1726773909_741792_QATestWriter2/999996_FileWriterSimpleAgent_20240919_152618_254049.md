## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the initial welcome message and round announcement, which are part of the game logic. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: 4b1bf456-2aab-467c-8e95-51a3b3b195c1
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expected the `rounds` to be 1 after the first round, but it was actually 2. This is because the game logic increments the round counter before each round starts, not after it ends. The test misinterpreted the game logic, assuming the round counter would be incremented after the round.

The relevant part of the game logic is in the `_play_round` method:

# Excerpt ID: bdd54f0c-53d6-478d-b742-3642ce9ceede
```python
def _play_round(self):
    self.rounds += 1
    self._show_text(self.player, f"Round {self.rounds}")
    # ... rest of the method
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, not a departure of game logic from the architecture.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our expectations in the test. Instead of checking the round number after each round, we should check it before the round starts. We also need to account for the initial welcome message and the first round announcement.

The expected gameplay trace should change as follows:
1. Dequeue the welcome message
2. Dequeue the first round announcement
3. Make choices for player and bot
4. Assert the game state (scores and round number)
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for subsequent rounds
6. Dequeue the game end choice
7. Make the final choice
8. Assert the scene transition

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 2

        # Round 3 (even though bot already won)
        runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        assert scene.rounds == 3
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)
        
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 3

        # Game end choice
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes account for the welcome message and round announcements, and check the round number before each round starts. This should resolve the issues in the test while maintaining the integrity of the game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

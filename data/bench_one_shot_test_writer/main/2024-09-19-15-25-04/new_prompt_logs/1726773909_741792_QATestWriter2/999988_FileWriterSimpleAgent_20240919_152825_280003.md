## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the bot's choices. In the game logic, after the player makes a choice, the bot also makes a choice. However, the test is not handling these bot choice events, causing it to get out of sync with the game's actual flow.

Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout for the first test:

# Excerpt ID: f4662247-c137-4f4c-bf47-6ff9bdca24eb
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expected to immediately move to the next round after the player's choice, but the game logic first waits for the bot's choice, then shows the choices and announces the round result. These bot choice events are not being handled by the test, causing it to get out of sync and eventually time out.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test didn't account for the bot's choices that occur after each player choice.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to handle the bot's choice events that occur after each player choice. We should use the `dequeue_wait_for_choice` method for the bot as well, and make a choice for the bot. This will allow the test to stay in sync with the game's actual flow.

The expected gameplay trace should change as follows:
1. Process the welcome message event
2. Process the round announcement event
3. Process the player choice event
4. Process the bot choice event
5. Process the choice announcement and round result events
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for subsequent rounds
7. Process the game end choice event
8. Assert the scene transition

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        runner.make_choice(rock)

        next(runner.iterate_game_events())
        next(runner.iterate_game_events())
        next(runner.iterate_game_events())

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 2

        # Game end choice
        next(runner.iterate_game_events())
        next(runner.iterate_game_events())
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes handle the bot's choice events that occur after each player choice. We use `runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)` to get the bot's choices and `runner.make_choice()` to make a choice for the bot. This allows the test to correctly synchronize with the game's logic and avoid timeouts.

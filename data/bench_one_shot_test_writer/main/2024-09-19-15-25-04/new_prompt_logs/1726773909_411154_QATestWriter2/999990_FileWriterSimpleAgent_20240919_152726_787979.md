## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the game ending after two rounds when a player wins twice. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and code for the first failing test:

# Excerpt ID: 38851120-c678-470e-9e79-5342beb898c3
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(paper))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
You chose Paper
Bot chose Rock
You win this round!
Congratulations! You won the game!
Final Score - You: 2, Bot: 0
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Play Again), Button(Quit)])
```

The test expects `scene.rounds` to be 3 after the second round, but it's actually 2. This is because the game ends after two rounds when a player wins twice. The relevant part of the `MainGameScene` class is:

# Excerpt ID: 8c8a7361-d313-4b3d-b4cd-72b3b1f42fb3
```python
def run(self):
    self._show_text(self.player, "Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!")
    
    while self.player_score < 2 and self.bot_score < 2 and self.rounds < 3:
        self._play_round()

    self._show_results()

    choice = self._wait_for_choice(self.player, [
        Button("Play Again"),
        Button("Quit")
    ])

    if choice.display_name == "Play Again":
        self._transition_to_scene("MainGameScene")
    else:
        self._transition_to_scene("MainMenuScene")
```

This is not a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, but rather a misunderstanding of when the game ends. The game ends when either player reaches 2 wins or after 3 rounds, whichever comes first.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to adjust our expectations in the test. Instead of expecting `scene.rounds` to be 3 after the second round when a player wins twice, we should expect it to be 2, which is the correct value when the game ends after two rounds due to a player winning twice.

The expected gameplay trace changes slightly. We need to update our assertions to check for `scene.rounds == 2` after the second round when a player wins twice. We should also add an assertion to check that the game has ended (by checking for the final choice between "Play Again" and "Quit").

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

```

These changes should resolve the failing tests by correctly accounting for when the game ends after two rounds due to a player winning twice.

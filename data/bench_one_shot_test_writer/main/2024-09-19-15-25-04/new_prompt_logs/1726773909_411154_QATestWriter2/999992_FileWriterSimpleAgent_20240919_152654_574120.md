## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the game incrementing the round counter before each round starts. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and code for the first failing test:

# Excerpt ID: ee5d1253-1024-4b4b-9c7a-ab44bb509d0d
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test expects `scene.rounds` to be 1 after the first round, but it's actually 2. This is because the game increments the round counter at the beginning of each round, not at the end. The relevant part of the `MainGameScene` class is:

# Excerpt ID: 8ec9fb36-7f52-40c6-897b-f062dcc99b4a
```python
def _play_round(self):
    self.rounds += 1
    self._show_text(self.player, f"Round {self.rounds}")
    # ... rest of the method
```

This is not a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test, but rather a misunderstanding of when the round counter is incremented.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to adjust our expectations in the test. Instead of expecting `scene.rounds` to be 1 after the first round, we should expect it to be 2, which is the correct value when the first round has completed and the second round is about to start.

The expected gameplay trace changes slightly. We need to update our assertions to check for `scene.rounds == 2` after each round, except for the last round where we should check for `scene.rounds == 3`.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

```

These changes should resolve the failing tests by correctly accounting for when the round counter is incremented in the game logic.

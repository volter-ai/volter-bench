## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test is not accounting for the game ending after two rounds when a player reaches a score of 2. Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout and code:

# Excerpt ID: 66eaca5d-1fbd-4954-b466-4b9d1b6f6a88
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(paper))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
You chose Paper
Bot chose Rock
You win this round!
Congratulations! You won the game!
Final Score - You: 2, Bot: 0
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Play Again), Button(Quit)])
```

The test expects `scene.rounds` to be 3 after the second round, but it's actually 2. This is because the game ends when a player reaches a score of 2, which happens after the second round. The game logic is correct, but the test didn't account for this early termination condition.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our expectations in the test. Instead of expecting `scene.rounds` to be 3 after the second round, we should expect it to be 2. We don't need to change the game logic or mock any methods. We just need to update our assertions to match the actual game behavior.

The expected gameplay trace should change as follows:
- After the first round, `scene.rounds` should be 1
- After the second round, `scene.rounds` should be 2 (not 3)
- The game should end after the second round when a player reaches a score of 2

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the corrected assertions:

```

These changes should resolve the failing tests by correctly accounting for the game ending after two rounds when a player reaches a score of 2.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1

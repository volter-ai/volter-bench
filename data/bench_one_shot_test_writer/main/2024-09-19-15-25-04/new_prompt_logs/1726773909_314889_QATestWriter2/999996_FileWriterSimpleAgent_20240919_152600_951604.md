## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

In both tests, the expected sequence of events didn't match the actual game logic. Let's look at the `test_player_wins` test:

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 25fd6bed-66e0-4319-ac2f-1925b7a5d6b0
```
Battle start!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
...
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
```

The test expected the battle to end after 4 rounds, but the game continued. This is because the test didn't account for the fact that both creatures' HP reach 1, not 0, after 3 rounds. The battle continues until one creature's HP reaches 0.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test expected the scene to transition to MainMenuScene after the player's fourth attack, but the battle wasn't over yet.

2. Solution:

To solve this, we need to adjust our tests to match the actual game logic:

1. Continue the battle until one creature's HP reaches 0.
2. Check for the transition to MainMenuScene only after a creature's HP reaches 0.
3. Add assertions to check the HP of both creatures after each round.
4. Ensure we handle both the player's and foe's turns in each round.

The expected gameplay trace will change. For the player_wins scenario, we'll need one more round where the player attacks and the foe's HP reaches 0. For the foe_wins scenario, we'll need to continue until the player's HP reaches 0.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: 10421a41-417a-42de-9029-d4b0f475d82a
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_player_wins(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.foe = foe

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 7
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 7

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")

        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 4
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 4

        # Round 3
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 1
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 1

        # Round 4 (final round)
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.foe_creature.hp == 0
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_foe_wins(self, app):
        player = app.create_player("test_player")
        foe = app.create_bot("default_player")
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        scene.foe = foe
        scene.player_creature.hp = 3  # Set player's creature HP to 3

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1 (final round)
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        assert scene.player_creature.hp == 0
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes ensure that the tests accurately reflect the game logic and properly test the battle sequence until a creature's HP reaches 0, triggering the transition to the MainMenuScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

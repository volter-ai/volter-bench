## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

1. Player wins the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player chooses Tackle (this should defeat the foe's creature)

2. Player loses the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle (this should defeat the player's creature)

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

```

This test file includes both the existing random run test and two new functional tests: one where the player wins the battle and another where the player loses the battle. The tests follow the guidelines provided, using the ThreadedSceneRunner to simulate the game events and making explicit choices for both the player and the foe.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

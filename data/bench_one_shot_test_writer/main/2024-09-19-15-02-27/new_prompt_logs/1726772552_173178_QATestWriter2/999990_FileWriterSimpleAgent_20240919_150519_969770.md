## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The test expects the battle to end and transition to the MainMenuScene after a few turns, but the battle is still ongoing. The error occurs because the test tries to dequeue a scene transition event, but instead receives another choice request event.

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 63e63939-8f6c-4756-b48b-8ebabf2e1e01
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 9453116d-1662-4b4d-9e65-df685e0c5532
```python
# Assert that the battle has progressed
assert player.active_creature.hp < player.active_creature.max_hp
assert main_game_scene.bot.active_creature.hp < main_game_scene.bot.active_creature.max_hp

# Scene transitions to MainMenuScene
assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that the battle will end after a few turns, but the battle continues until one player's creatures are all knocked out. The test needs to be updated to reflect the actual game logic and continue the battle until it naturally concludes.

2. Solution description:

To fix this, we need to update the test to continue the battle until one player wins. We'll need to add more turns and check for the win condition after each turn. The test should continue making choices for both players until the battle ends and the scene transitions to MainMenuScene.

The expected gameplay trace will change significantly. It will now include multiple turns until one player's creatures are all knocked out. After that, we'll expect the scene transition to MainMenuScene.

3. Solution implementation:

I'll update the test_main_game_scene_full_playthrough method in the TestMainGameScene class. Here's the modified file:

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture

        return app.create_player("test_player")

    @pytest.fixture
    def main_game_scene(self, app, player):
        return MainGameScene(app, player)

    def test_main_game_scene_full_playthrough(self, app, player, main_game_scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(main_game_scene)

        # Initial state check
        assert player.active_creature.prototype_id == "bubwool"
        assert main_game_scene.bot.active_creature.prototype_id == "scizard"

        while True:
            # Player turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            tackle_skill = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")

            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
            bot_skill = choices[0]  # Choose the first skill, which could be either tackle or fireball
            runner.make_choice(bot_skill)

            # Check if bot's active creature has fainted
            if main_game_scene.bot.active_creature.hp == 0:
                if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in main_game_scene.bot.creatures):
                    break  # Bot has lost, end the battle
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
                swap_choice = choices[0]  # Only one choice available: swap to next creature
                runner.make_choice(swap_choice)

            # Check if player's active creature has fainted
            if player.active_creature.hp == 0:
                if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in player.creatures):
                    break  # Player has lost, end the battle
                choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
                swap_choice = choices[0]  # Only one choice available: swap to next creature
                runner.make_choice(swap_choice)

        # Assert that the battle has ended
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in player.creatures) or 
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in main_game_scene.bot.creatures))

        # Scene transitions to MainMenuScene
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This updated test now correctly reflects the game logic, continuing the battle until one player's creatures are all knocked out. It handles creature fainting and swapping for both the player and the bot. The test is more robust and accurately represents a full playthrough of the MainGameScene.

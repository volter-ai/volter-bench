## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. I'll add these tests to the existing file `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`.

Play-through description:

1. Initialize the MainGameScene with a human player and a bot opponent.
2. Player chooses "Attack".
3. Player selects "Tackle" skill.
4. Bot chooses "Attack".
5. Bot selects "Fireball" skill.
6. Resolution phase occurs (player's Bubwool uses Tackle, bot's Scizard uses Fireball).
7. Player chooses "Swap".
8. Player selects "Dumbird".
9. Bot chooses "Attack".
10. Bot selects "Tackle" skill.
11. Resolution phase occurs (player swaps to Dumbird, bot's Scizard uses Tackle).
12. Player chooses "Attack".
13. Player selects "Tackle" skill.
14. Bot chooses "Attack".
15. Bot selects "Fireball" skill.
16. Resolution phase occurs (player's Dumbird uses Tackle, bot's Scizard uses Fireball).
17. Dumbird faints, player is forced to swap.
18. Player selects "Bubwool".
19. Bot chooses "Attack".
20. Bot selects "Tackle" skill.
21. Resolution phase occurs (bot's Scizard uses Tackle).
22. Player chooses "Attack".
23. Player selects "Lick" skill.
24. Bot chooses "Attack".
25. Bot selects "Fireball" skill.
26. Resolution phase occurs (player's Bubwool uses Lick, bot's Scizard uses Fireball).
27. Bubwool faints, player loses the battle.
28. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene.

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This test covers a full play-through of the MainGameScene, including player and bot choices, skill usage, creature swapping, and battle resolution. It checks the state of the creatures and the scene at various points throughout the battle, and ensures that the scene transitions correctly when the battle ends.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
I understand. I'll describe the play-through and then write the tests for the MainGameScene. I'll add these tests to the existing file `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`.

Play-through description:

1. Initialize the MainGameScene with a human player and a bot opponent.
2. Player chooses "Attack".
3. Player selects "Tackle" skill.
4. Bot chooses "Attack".
5. Bot selects "Fireball" skill.
6. Resolution phase occurs (player's Bubwool uses Tackle, bot's Scizard uses Fireball).
7. Player chooses "Swap".
8. Player selects "Dumbird".
9. Bot chooses "Attack".
10. Bot selects "Tackle" skill.
11. Resolution phase occurs (player swaps to Dumbird, bot's Scizard uses Tackle).
12. Player chooses "Attack".
13. Player selects "Tackle" skill.
14. Bot chooses "Attack".
15. Bot selects "Fireball" skill.
16. Resolution phase occurs (player's Dumbird uses Tackle, bot's Scizard uses Fireball).
17. Dumbird faints, player is forced to swap.
18. Player selects "Bubwool".
19. Player chooses "Attack".
20. Player selects "Lick" skill.
21. Bot chooses "Attack".
22. Bot selects "Fireball" skill.
23. Resolution phase occurs (player's Bubwool uses Lick, bot's Scizard uses Fireball).
24. Bubwool faints, player has no more creatures.
25. Battle ends, player loses.
26. Scene transitions to MainMenuScene.

Now, I'll write the test based on this play-through:

```

This test simulates a full battle in the MainGameScene, covering various aspects of the gameplay including attacking, swapping creatures, and the battle ending conditions. The test checks the initial state, simulates player and bot turns, and verifies the final state of the battle.

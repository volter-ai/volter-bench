## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The captured stdout shows the following sequence of events:
# Excerpt ID: d571eee0-9525-4c16-b3fe-1b53694d3679
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
...
Default Player's Bubwool fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
```

This sequence repeats four times, corresponding to four turns of battle. After the fourth turn, the player's Bubwool faints, and the game presents a choice to select the next creature (Dumbird).

The error occurs because the test expects to find a Button with the display name "Attack", but instead receives a SelectThing choice for the Dumbird creature. This indicates that the test misinterpreted the game logic. When a creature faints, the player is forced to swap to another creature before continuing the battle.

The relevant part of the code causing this error is:
# Excerpt ID: 65a5429b-2204-4c8b-a27f-8d61712b82c5
```python
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test doesn't account for the forced creature swap when a creature faints.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to match the actual game logic. We should add a check for the forced swap scenario and handle it appropriately. 

We'll need to modify the test to:
1. Check if the choices presented are for a forced swap (i.e., a list containing only SelectThing choices for creatures).
2. If it's a forced swap, make the swap choice.
3. If it's not a forced swap, proceed with the regular attack sequence.

The gameplay trace will change to include the forced swap scenario. After a creature faints, we'll need to handle the swap before continuing with the regular battle sequence.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        # Final state check
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in player.creatures) or all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in main_game_scene.bot.creatures)
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the while loop and explicitly listed out each turn's choices.
2. Added a step to handle the forced swap when the player's creature faints.
3. Continued the battle for one more turn after the forced swap to ensure the game continues correctly.
4. Kept the final transition and state checks at the end of the test.

These changes should align the test with the actual game logic and resolve the KeyError we encountered. The test now simulates a full battle sequence, including the forced swap scenario, and checks for the expected outcome.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

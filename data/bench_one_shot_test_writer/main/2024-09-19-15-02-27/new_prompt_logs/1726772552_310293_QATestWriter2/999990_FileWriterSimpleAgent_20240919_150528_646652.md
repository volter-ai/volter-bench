## Proposed Code Change
I understand. Let's analyze the problem and provide a solution.

1. What went wrong:

The captured stdout shows the following sequence of events:
# Excerpt ID: 23bb80d3-041c-4fd1-a875-44914d61ad30
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(lick)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
_wait_for_choice received choice Button(Attack)
_wait_for_choice(Basic Opponent, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle)), SelectThing(Skill(fireball)), Button(Back)])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool used Tackle!
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard took 5 damage!"}
BotListener:on_show_event:show_text: {'text': "Basic Opponent's Scizard used Tackle!"}
Default Player's Bubwool took 8 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This sequence repeats three times, corresponding to the three turns simulated in the test. However, after the third turn, instead of transitioning to the MainMenuScene as expected, the game continues with another choice request for the player.

The error occurs because the test expects the battle to end after three turns, but the battle is continuing. This indicates that the test misinterpreted the game logic. The battle should continue until one player's creatures are all defeated, which hasn't happened after just three turns.

The relevant part of the code causing this error is:
# Excerpt ID: 818ff39b-68dd-48e2-88bd-b664260f3fca
```python
# Check if the battle has ended
scene_name = runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
assert scene_name == "MainMenuScene"
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The battle is not ending after a fixed number of turns as the test expects. Instead, it continues until one player's creatures are all defeated.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to match the actual game logic. Instead of expecting the battle to end after a fixed number of turns, we should continue the battle until it naturally ends (i.e., when one player's creatures are all defeated).

We'll need to modify the test to continue making choices for both players until we see the transition to the MainMenuScene. This means we'll need to add more choice-making steps and remove the assumption about the number of turns.

The gameplay trace will change significantly. We'll need to continue the battle, making choices for both the player and the bot, for as many turns as necessary until the battle ends naturally. This means we'll need to add more choice-making steps and remove the fixed number of turns.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: bd59227c-a987-48c6-94e1-852b0d660a6b
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # More moves needed for the complex MainGameScene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition, \
                    patch.object(MainGameScene, '_quit_whole_game') as mock_quit:

                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called or mock_quit.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"

                    if mock_quit.called:
                        print("_quit_whole_game called")
                    if mock_transition.called:
                        print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()
                    mock_quit.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    @pytest.fixture
    def main_game_scene(self, app, player):
        return MainGameScene(app, player)

    def test_main_game_scene_full_battle(self, app, player, main_game_scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(main_game_scene)

        # Initial state check
        assert player.active_creature.prototype_id == "bubwool"
        assert main_game_scene.bot.active_creature.prototype_id == "scizard"

        while True:
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
            skill = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(skill)

            # Bot's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
            attack_button = find_button(choices, "Attack")
            runner.make_choice(attack_button)

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(main_game_scene.bot)
            skill = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(skill)

            # Check if the battle has ended
            try:
                scene_name = runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
                assert scene_name == "MainMenuScene"
                break
            except ValueError:
                # Battle hasn't ended, continue to next turn
                pass

        # Final state check
        assert all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in player.creatures) or all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in main_game_scene.bot.creatures)
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the fixed number of turns and replaced it with a while loop that continues until the battle ends.
2. Added a try-except block to check for the scene transition after each turn.
3. Moved the final state check outside the loop, as it should only be performed after the battle has ended.

These changes should align the test with the actual game logic and resolve the ValueError we encountered. The test now simulates a full battle sequence and checks for the expected outcome.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

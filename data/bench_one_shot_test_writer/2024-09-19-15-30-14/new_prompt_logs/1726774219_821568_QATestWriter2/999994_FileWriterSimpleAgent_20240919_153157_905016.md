## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test failed because it expected to find a "Button" with the display name "Attack" in the choices presented to the human player. However, the actual choices presented were a list containing only one "SelectThing" for a creature named "dumbird".

Let's look at the relevant part of the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: c9d805d9-295d-45c0-997b-163886dedffa
```
Default Player's Bubwool fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(dumbird))])
```

This indicates that the human player's active creature (Bubwool) fainted, and the game is now asking the player to select a new creature to send out. This is consistent with the game logic described in the architecture, which states that when a creature's HP reaches zero, the player must swap to another creature if they have any available.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes that after each turn, the player will always be presented with the choice to "Attack" or "Swap". However, when a creature faints, the player is instead presented with a list of available creatures to swap in.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to modify our test to handle the case where a creature faints and the player needs to select a new creature. We should:

1. Add a check for when the choices presented are for selecting a new creature (i.e., when the list contains only SelectThing objects for creatures).
2. When this occurs, select the new creature and continue the battle.
3. Continue this process until one player has no more creatures available, at which point the battle should end and transition to the MainMenuScene.

The expected gameplay trace will change. Instead of a fixed sequence of "Attack" choices, we'll need to handle creature swaps when they occur. This means the number of turns and the exact sequence of actions in the test will be variable, depending on when creatures faint.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file with the changes implemented:

            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(human_player)
            if all(isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Creature) for choice in choices):
                # Creature fainted, select new creature

                tackle_choice = find_select_thing(skill_choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle_choice)

            # Bot player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
            if all(isinstance(choice, SelectThing) and isinstance(choice.thing, Creature) for choice in choices):
                # Creature fainted, select new creature
                new_creature = choices[0]
                runner.make_choice(new_creature)
            else:
                attack_choice = find_button(choices, "Attack")
                runner.make_choice(attack_choice)

                skill_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(bot_player)
                tackle_choice = find_select_thing(skill_choices, "tackle")
                runner.make_choice(tackle_choice)

            # Check if battle has ended
            if all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures) or \
               all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.bot.creatures):
                break
        else:
            pytest.fail("Battle did not end within the expected number of turns")

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Additional assertions to verify the battle outcome
        assert (all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures) or 
                all(creature.hp == 0 for creature in scene.bot.creatures))
        assert (any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.player.creatures) or 
                any(creature.hp > 0 for creature in scene.bot.creatures))
```

This modified test now handles the case where a creature faints and the player needs to select a new creature. It checks if the choices presented are all SelectThing objects for creatures, and if so, it selects the first available creature. The test continues until one player has no more creatures available, at which point it verifies that the scene transitions to the MainMenuScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

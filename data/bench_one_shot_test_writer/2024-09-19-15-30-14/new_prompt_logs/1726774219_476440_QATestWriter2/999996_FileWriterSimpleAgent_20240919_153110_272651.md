## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the tests are expecting the bot to make a choice first, but the game logic is actually asking the human player to make a choice first. This is evident from the captured stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 6bf4ac55-e7d0-4df7-8263-6da3d992cbf9
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test is trying to dequeue a choice for the bot:

# Excerpt ID: 161cdd40-d355-41ae-97f6-17a674a62061
```python
runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
```

But the actual game is waiting for the player's choice. This mismatch causes the ValueError we're seeing. This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The game is designed to ask the human player for their choice first, then the bot makes its choice.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this, we need to adjust our tests to match the actual game flow. Instead of expecting the bot to choose first, we should:

1. Dequeue the wait_for_choice for the player first.
2. Make a choice for the player.
3. Then dequeue the wait_for_choice for the bot.
4. Make a choice for the bot.

We'll need to do this for each round of the game. The expected gameplay trace will change to reflect this order of events.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the corrected logic:

# Excerpt ID: 30adc301-ba43-4e67-a387-0f7edb786256

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()

        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        assert scene.player_score == 0

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

    def test_three_rounds_with_tie_player_wins_and_quits(self, app):

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 1

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert scene.player_score == 1
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 2

        # Round 3
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")

        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

These changes ensure that we're following the correct game flow: player choice, then bot choice, for each round. The tests now accurately reflect the game's logic and should pass.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]

## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the tests are asserting the game state (specifically the `rounds` attribute) at the wrong point in the game flow. Let's look at the captured stdout for the first failing test:

# Excerpt ID: 3be60c8b-d2b1-458b-b8c7-3af6d1910fb5
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Scissors
You win this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

The test is asserting that `scene.rounds == 1` after both the player and bot have made their choices. However, the game logic increments the `rounds` counter at the beginning of each round, not after the choices are made. This is why we see "Round 2" in the stdout before the test assertion fails.

The relevant part of the test code is:

# Excerpt ID: a163d366-e1d7-47f0-9d06-a85f18a09e8d
```python
# Round 1
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
runner.make_choice(rock)

choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
runner.make_choice(scissors)

assert scene.player_score == 1
assert scene.bot_score == 0
assert scene.rounds == 1  # This assertion fails
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that the round counter is incremented after the choices are made, but in reality, it's incremented at the beginning of each round.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this issue, we need to adjust our assertions to match the actual game flow. Instead of asserting the round count after the choices are made, we should assert it before the choices are made for each round. We also need to account for the fact that the round counter starts at 1 when the scene is initialized.

The expected gameplay trace should change to reflect this:
1. Assert initial state (rounds = 1)
2. Make choices for player and bot
3. Assert scores
4. Assert next round (rounds = 2)
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for subsequent rounds
6. Assert final state and transition

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the corrected logic:

```

These changes should resolve the issues with the tests and correctly match the game's logic, where the round counter is incremented at the beginning of each round.

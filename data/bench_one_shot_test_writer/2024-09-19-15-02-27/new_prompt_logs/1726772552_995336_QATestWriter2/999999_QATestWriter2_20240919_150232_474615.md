# MainGameScene

The Main Game Scene is where the human player does battle against a bot player using their teams of creatures. This is a scene that can be played by one player, but should be treated like a symmetric multiplayer scene.

## Scene Logic

The scene plays through repeating turns with distinct phases. Turns consist of:
- Player Choice Phase
- Foe Choice Phase
- Resolution Phase

### Player Choice Phase

During the player choice phase, the player is shown their creature's list of available skills. The player is able to choose one of those skills and that is queued for the resolution phase.

### Foe Choice Phase

During the foe choice phase, the opposing player is shown their own creature's list of available skills and chooses one from that list. This skill is also queued for the resolution phase.

### Resolution Phase

During the resolution phase, the skills that were queued in the previous two steps are resolved. Each skill is checked and damage is dealt to the opponent according to the damage stat on the skill. Each skill in the queue is removed from the queue as they are executed.

### Battle End Condition

At any point when one creature's hp reaches zero, the battle ends. At that point, a message is shown informing the player whether they have won or lost depending on which creature was knocked out.
- If the player's creature was defeated, then they are informed that they are the loser.
- If the opponent's creature's hp is reduced to zero, then the player is informed that they are the winner.

Guidelines:
1. Each of your tests should instantiate a scene and use the ThreadedSceneRunner to run the scene and use the iterator to get the game events 
2. Remember that wait_for_choice on BotListener and HumanListener are now going to show up in the iterator for game events
3. The choice must be taken from the choices list from `dequeue_wait_for_choice` because we must use the exact choice object during `make_choice`
4. If there are calls to the module `random`, these calls will also be surfaced as game events so we can control the full run. Note that BotListener will be surfaced as a player choice event not a random event
5. You cannot patch or mock any methods or classes, these should be functional tests. However, you may check or set the attributes of the players or the game scene as needed 
6. Each test should be looking at an exact sequence of actions and test different 'traces' of different outcomes
7. All players which are not declared by the scene must be created using `app.create_player` or `app.create_bot` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
8. If you need to create data models other than player, they must be created using `from_prototype_id` (you can modify the attributes after it has been created)
9. You CANNOT change the game logic to be different from what is described by the markdowns
10. DO NOT remove the existing random runner test, create a new test class and keep the existing random runner class unchanged
11. The only types of events coming from the ThreadedSceneRunner will be choices, transition to scene, and quit whole game. DO NOT test show_text, that is basically just visual information, to check game state you should directly assert the game scene's attributes
12. You CANNOT write while loops or for loops in the test. Every event must be tested explicitly and sequentially regardless of how many times it repeats
13. Every test must be a full play-through so the end of every test must be a `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`

Example:
```python {file path}
runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
runner.start_game(main_menu_scene)

choices = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x)

## control loops like 'while' and 'for' are not allowed, we must check each choice explicitly in sequence
choices2 = scene_runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
choice_x2 = find_select_thing(choices, "prototype_id_x")
runner.make_choice(choice_x2)

## every test must be a full play-through so it must end with `dequeue_transition_to_scene` or `dequeue_quit_whole_game`
assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
```

Each of your tests should describe a full play-through of the scene. During the full play-through, different behaviors of the scene will be tested

Do the following in the same response:
First describes play-through(s) that will be simulated by the test. Try to accomplish the tests with as few play-throughs as possible. Every step of the play through should be described explicitly. Do not say 'repeat X until', list each step
Secondly write the tests

You should add your tests to `main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py`

Write out all the files in the format:
```{filetype} {filepath}
{content}
```
Write out the whole file so I can copy-paste

IMPORTANT: do not add any comments or placeholders like `# ... (keep this class unchanged)`. Unless the line was explicitly changed or removed by you in the edit, no line from the original code can be left out in your response

Role: assistant
Content: I understand. I'll describe the play-throughs and then write the tests accordingly. Here are the play-throughs I'll simulate:

1. Player wins the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 0/10)
   - Battle ends, Player wins

2. Player loses the battle:
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 7/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 4/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Player's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Foe's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 1/10)
   - Player chooses Tackle
   - Foe chooses Tackle
   - Foe's Bubwool deals 3 damage to Player's Bubwool (HP: 0/10)
   - Battle ends, Player loses

Now, I'll write the tests based on these play-throughs:

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This file includes both the existing random run test and the new functional tests for the MainGameScene. The new tests simulate the two play-throughs described earlier, one where the player wins and one where the player loses.

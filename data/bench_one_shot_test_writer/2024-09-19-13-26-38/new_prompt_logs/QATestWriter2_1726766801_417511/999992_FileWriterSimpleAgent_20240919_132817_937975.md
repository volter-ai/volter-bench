## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The main issue is that the test expects a third round to occur, but the game ends after two rounds because the bot wins both rounds. Let's look at the relevant stdout and code:

Relevant stdout:
# Excerpt ID: 20f8270c-0979-46fa-a06e-1b5b65b2263b
```
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(paper))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(scissors))
You chose Paper
Bot chose Scissors
Bot wins this round!
Round 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(rock))
_wait_for_choice(Bot, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(paper))
You chose Rock
Bot chose Paper
Bot wins this round!
The bot won the game. Better luck next time!
Final Score - You: 0, Bot: 2
_wait_for_choice(Player, [Button(Play Again), Button(Quit)])
```

Relevant code:
# Excerpt ID: 149193d1-439c-4062-873b-a3e8f8ed7f4a
```python
# Round 3
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
scissors = find_select_thing(choices, "scissors")
runner.make_choice(scissors)

bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
rock = find_select_thing(bot_choices, "rock")
runner.make_choice(rock)
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumes that the game always goes for three rounds, but the game actually ends when one player wins two rounds. In this case, the bot won the first two rounds, so the game ended before the third round could start.

The specific difference is that the test expects a third round of choices, but instead receives the final "Play Again" or "Quit" choices. This is why we get a KeyError when trying to find the "scissors" choice in the final set of choices.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this problem, we need to adjust our test to account for the possibility of the game ending after two rounds. We should:

1. Remove the expectation for a third round.
2. Add assertions after each round to check the game state.
3. Add a final assertion to verify that the game ended as expected.

The expected gameplay trace should change to:
1. Start the game
2. Handle the player's choice for the first round
3. Handle the bot's choice for the first round
4. Assert the game state after the first round
5. Handle the player's choice for the second round
6. Handle the bot's choice for the second round
7. Assert the game state after the second round
8. Handle the final choice (Play Again or Quit)
9. Assert the final game state

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: 52dbc5b1-cc0e-4d6d-b4af-c70849985b99
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    def test_player_wins_two_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert scene.player_score == 1
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 1

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        rock = find_select_thing(bot_choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert scene.player_score == 2
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 2

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_again = find_button(choices, "Play Again")
        runner.make_choice(play_again)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 2
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 2

    def test_bot_wins_two_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        scissors = find_select_thing(bot_choices, "scissors")
        runner.make_choice(scissors)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 1
        assert scene.rounds == 1

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        bot_choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.bot)
        paper = find_select_thing(bot_choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 2

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 0
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 2
```

The main changes are:
1. Renamed `test_bot_wins_two_out_of_three_rounds` to `test_bot_wins_two_rounds` to reflect the actual game logic.
2. Removed the expectation for a third round in the bot wins test.
3. Added assertions after each round to check the game state.
4. Updated the final assertions to match the expected game state after two rounds.

These changes should resolve the KeyError and allow the tests to run correctly, following the actual game logic of ending after one player wins two rounds.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type.

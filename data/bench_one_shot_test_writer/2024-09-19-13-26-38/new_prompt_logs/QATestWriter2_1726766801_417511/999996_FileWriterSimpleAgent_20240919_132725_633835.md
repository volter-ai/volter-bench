## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The tests are failing because they're not properly handling the game flow. The captured stdout shows:

# Excerpt ID: 481708cb-6b7f-4dd1-b453-c2fbad73bd50
```
Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game!
Round 1
_wait_for_choice(Player, [SelectThing(Skill(rock)), SelectThing(Skill(paper)), SelectThing(Skill(scissors))])
```

This indicates that the game is starting correctly, but the test is not properly handling the initial "Welcome" message. The test is trying to dequeue a wait_for_choice event for the welcome message, which doesn't exist, causing a TimeoutError.

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test assumes there's a choice event for the welcome message, but the game scene only shows text for the welcome message without waiting for a choice.

2. Describe solution:

To fix this, we need to remove the dequeue for the welcome message and start directly with the first round's choice. We also need to handle the bot's choices properly by dequeuing random calls for the bot's choices.

The expected gameplay trace should change to:
1. Start the game
2. Handle the first round's choice
3. Handle the bot's choice (random call)
4. Continue with subsequent rounds
5. Handle the final choice (Play Again or Quit)

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

# Excerpt ID: 2c0e80ca-c742-41bd-a123-763f9707bd7c
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        HumanListener.random_mode = True

        # Patch the transition_to_scene method
        with patch.object(App, 'transition_to_scene') as mock_transition:
            for i in range(10):
                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration
                mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    def test_player_wins_two_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("rock")]

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_again = find_button(choices, "Play Again")
        runner.make_choice(play_again)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 2
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 2

    def test_bot_wins_two_out_of_three_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 3
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("paper")]

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 1
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 3
```

The main changes are:
1. Removed the dequeue for the welcome message in both tests.
2. Kept the logic for handling rounds and choices the same.
3. Ensured that we're properly handling the bot's choices by dequeuing random calls.

These changes should resolve the TimeoutError and allow the tests to run correctly, following the actual game logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

## Proposed Code Change
I'll describe two play-throughs that will cover different scenarios in the MainGameScene, and then write the corresponding tests.

Play-through 1:
1. Human player wins the first two rounds (Rock vs Scissors, Paper vs Rock)
2. Game ends after two rounds with the player winning
3. Player chooses to play again

Play-through 2:
1. Bot wins the first round (Scissors vs Paper)
2. Human player wins the second round (Rock vs Scissors)
3. Bot wins the third round (Paper vs Rock)
4. Game ends after three rounds with the bot winning
5. Player chooses to quit

Now, I'll write the tests for these play-throughs:

```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py

                player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
                main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

                main_game_scene.run()

                # Assert that transition_to_scene was called
                assert mock_transition.called

                # Reset the mock calls for the next iteration

        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("rock")]

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        play_again = find_button(choices, "Play Again")
        runner.make_choice(play_again)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainGameScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 2
        assert scene.bot_score == 0
        assert scene.rounds == 2

    def test_bot_wins_two_out_of_three_rounds(self, app, player):
        scene = MainGameScene(app, player)
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Welcome message
        runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)

        # Round 1
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        paper = find_select_thing(choices, "paper")
        runner.make_choice(paper)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 2
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("scissors")]

        # Round 3
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        rock = find_select_thing(choices, "rock")
        runner.make_choice(rock)

        random_call = runner.dequeue_random_call()
        assert random_call['function'] == 'choice'
        scene.bot.skills = [Skill.from_prototype_id("paper")]

        # Game end
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(player)
        quit_button = find_button(choices, "Quit")
        runner.make_choice(quit_button)

        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
        assert scene.player_score == 1
        assert scene.bot_score == 2
        assert scene.rounds == 3
```

These tests cover the two play-throughs described earlier, testing different game outcomes and player choices. The tests use the ThreadedSceneRunner to simulate the game flow and assert the expected behavior and state of the MainGameScene.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

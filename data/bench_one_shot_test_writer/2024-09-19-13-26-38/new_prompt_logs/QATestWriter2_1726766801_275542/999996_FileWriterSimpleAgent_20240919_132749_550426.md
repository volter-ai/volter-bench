## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

In the `test_normal_battle_flow` test, the error occurs after several turns of the battle. The relevant part of the stdout is:

# Excerpt ID: 3d23ed4a-1d67-42c9-a21f-cb66d5cbef8a
```
Default Player's Dumbird fainted!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Creature(bubwool))])
```

The test expects to find a Button with the display name "Attack", but instead, it receives a SelectThing choice for swapping creatures. This is because the player's active creature (Dumbird) has fainted, and the game is forcing a swap to the next available creature (Bubwool).

The error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic in the test. The test doesn't account for the possibility of a creature fainting and the subsequent forced swap.

In the `test_forced_swap` test, the error occurs because the test expects the bot to make a choice first, but the game is actually asking the player to make a choice. This is evident from the stdout:

# Excerpt ID: 2a069e2b-7d75-45b5-ab30-23520525b641
```
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [Button(Attack), Button(Swap)])
```

This error is also due to a misinterpretation of the game logic. The test assumes that setting the player's creature's HP to 1 will immediately trigger the bot's turn, but the game still follows its normal turn order.

2. Describe solution:

For `test_normal_battle_flow`, we need to modify the test to handle the possibility of creatures fainting and forced swaps. We should check the HP of creatures after each turn and handle the swap scenario when a creature faints.

For `test_forced_swap`, we need to start the test from the beginning of a turn and play through until we reach the point where the player's creature faints and a forced swap occurs.

In both cases, we need to make the tests more flexible to handle different scenarios that may occur during the battle.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the updated test file with the necessary changes:

        runner.make_choice(skill_choice)
```

These changes make the tests more robust and able to handle different scenarios that may occur during the battle, including forced swaps when creatures faint. The `test_normal_battle_flow` now continues until the battle ends, handling both regular turns and forced swaps. The `test_forced_swap` now starts from the beginning of a turn and plays through until the forced swap occurs, ensuring that the game logic is followed correctly.

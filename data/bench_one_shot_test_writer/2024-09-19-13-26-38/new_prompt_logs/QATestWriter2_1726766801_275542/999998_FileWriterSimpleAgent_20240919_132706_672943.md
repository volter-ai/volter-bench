## Proposed Code Change
I'll describe two play-throughs that will test different aspects of the MainGameScene, and then provide the updated test file with the new tests.

Play-through 1: Normal Battle Flow
1. Initialize the scene with a human player and a bot opponent
2. Player chooses to attack with their first creature's first skill
3. Bot chooses to attack with their first creature's first skill
4. Resolve the turn, with the faster creature attacking first
5. Player chooses to swap to their second creature
6. Bot chooses to attack
7. Resolve the turn, with the player's swap happening first
8. Continue until one player's creatures are all fainted
9. Verify that the battle ends and transitions to the MainMenuScene

Play-through 2: Edge Case - Forced Swap
1. Initialize the scene with a human player and a bot opponent
2. Set the player's active creature's HP to 1
3. Bot chooses to attack with a skill that will faint the player's creature
4. Resolve the turn, forcing the player to swap
5. Player chooses their second creature
6. Verify that the battle continues with the new active creature

Now, I'll provide the updated test file with these new tests:

            runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene()
```

This updated test file includes the existing random run test and adds two new tests: `test_normal_battle_flow` and `test_forced_swap`. These tests cover different aspects of the MainGameScene, including normal battle flow, swapping creatures, and the forced swap when a creature faints.

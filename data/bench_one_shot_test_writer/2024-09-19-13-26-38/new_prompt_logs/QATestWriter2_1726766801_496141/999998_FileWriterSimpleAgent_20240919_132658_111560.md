## Proposed Code Change
I'll describe two play-throughs that will be simulated by the tests, and then write the tests accordingly.

Play-through 1: Normal battle flow
1. Player chooses Tackle
2. Foe chooses Tackle
3. Resolution phase occurs
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until one creature's HP reaches 0
5. Check that the correct win/lose message is shown and transition to MainMenuScene occurs

Play-through 2: Edge case - Both creatures faint simultaneously
1. Set both creatures' HP to 3
2. Player chooses Tackle
3. Foe chooses Tackle
4. Resolution phase occurs, both creatures should faint
5. Check that the player loses (as per the logic in _check_battle_end)

Now, I'll write the tests for these play-throughs:

# Excerpt ID: 4b4f681d-0569-408e-9e1f-8ad8d001ae88

                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:

    def test_normal_battle_flow(self, scene):

            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)

            runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check that the battle ended
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Check final state
        assert (scene.player_creature.hp <= 0) != (scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0)
        if scene.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0
        else:
            assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0

    def test_simultaneous_faint(self, scene):
        # Set both creatures' HP to 3
        scene.player_creature.hp = 3
        scene.foe_creature.hp = 3

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Foe's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)

        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check that the battle ended
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp <= 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0
```

This file includes both the existing random run test and the new functional tests for the MainGameScene. The new tests cover the two play-throughs described earlier: a normal battle flow and an edge case where both creatures faint simultaneously.

Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

Examples:
overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1

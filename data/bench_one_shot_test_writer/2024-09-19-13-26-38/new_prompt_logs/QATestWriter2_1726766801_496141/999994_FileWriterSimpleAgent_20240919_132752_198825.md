## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

For both `test_normal_battle_flow` and `test_player_wins`, the tests expected a scene transition event, but instead received a choice request event. This indicates that the battle is continuing when the tests expected it to end.

Relevant stdout for `test_normal_battle_flow`:
# Excerpt ID: e26a7d58-d54e-43b8-bd04-13b39b381575
```
Battle start!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
Default Player's Bubwool uses Tackle!
Bubwool takes 3 damage!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
```

The test expected the battle to end after two rounds, but it continued to a third round. This is likely due to the creatures having more HP than anticipated.

For `test_player_wins`, the test set the player's creature HP to 4 and the foe's creature HP to 3, expecting the battle to end after one attack. However, the battle continued to a second round.

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed the battle would end sooner than it actually does based on the current game logic.

2. Describe solution:

For both tests, we need to adjust our expectations of how long the battle will last. We should continue the battle loop until we receive a scene transition event, which indicates the battle has ended.

For `test_normal_battle_flow`, we should remove the attempt to dequeue a scene transition after each round and instead continue the battle until a scene transition occurs or a maximum number of rounds is reached.

For `test_player_wins`, we should set the creature HPs to values that will ensure the battle ends after one round. We can set the player's creature HP to 10 (full health) and the foe's creature HP to 3 (which will be reduced to 0 after one Tackle).

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file:

# Excerpt ID: 29bba642-763b-4cbc-892c-b8e3f13879e0
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_select_thing
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    @pytest.fixture
    def scene(self, app, player):
        return MainGameScene(app, player)

    def test_normal_battle_flow(self, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        max_rounds = 10
        for _ in range(max_rounds):
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check if the battle has ended
            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                break
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            pytest.fail("Battle did not end within the maximum number of rounds")

        # Check final state
        assert (scene.player_creature.hp <= 0) != (scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0)
        if scene.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0
        else:
            assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0

    def test_player_wins(self, scene):
        # Set player's creature HP to 10 (full health) and foe's creature HP to 3
        scene.player_creature.hp = 10
        scene.foe_creature.hp = 3

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check that the battle ended
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0
```

In this solution, we've made the following changes:

1. In `test_normal_battle_flow`, we now continue the battle for up to 10 rounds or until a scene transition occurs. This allows for longer battles while still ensuring the test doesn't run indefinitely.

2. In `test_player_wins`, we've adjusted the initial HP values to ensure the battle ends after one round. The player's creature starts with full health (10 HP) while the foe's creature starts with 3 HP, which will be reduced to 0 after one Tackle.

These changes should resolve the issues while maintaining the integrity of the functional tests and adhering to the game's logic.

## Directions
Reply with a JSON list of actions to perform. 'overwrite' are the only valid action type. 
Make sure you are using the excerpt_id which contains the entire contents of the file

overwriting files (this works for python, markdown, or any other file type)
```json output_example1
[{"action": "overwrite", "excerpt_id": "<id>", "file_path": "<relative file path>"}]
```

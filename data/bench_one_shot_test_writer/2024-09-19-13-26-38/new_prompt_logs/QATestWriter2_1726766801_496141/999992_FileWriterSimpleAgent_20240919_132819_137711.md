## Proposed Code Change
1. What went wrong:

The test `test_player_wins` expected the battle to end after the player's turn, but it didn't. Let's look at the captured stdout:

# Excerpt ID: b8beaf74-d84b-4b84-b646-d57a12b459dc
```
Battle start!
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
_wait_for_choice received choice SelectThing(Skill(tackle))
_wait_for_choice(Default Player, [SelectThing(Skill(tackle))])
```

This shows that after the player's turn, the game is waiting for another choice instead of ending. The test expected a scene transition, but got another choice request.

The relevant part of the test code is:

# Excerpt ID: 9d07e4af-a72a-4967-a84c-695afd8b2087
```python
# Player's turn
choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
runner.make_choice(tackle)

# Check that the battle ended
assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
```

This error is caused by a misinterpretation of the game logic by the test. The test assumed that the battle would end immediately after the player's turn if the foe's creature's HP reaches zero. However, the game logic actually allows the foe to take their turn even if their creature's HP is zero, and only checks for battle end after both players have taken their turns.

2. Describe solution:

To solve this, we need to adjust our test to account for the foe's turn before expecting the battle to end. We should:

1. Handle the player's turn as before.
2. Then handle the foe's turn.
3. After both turns, expect the scene transition.

We also need to adjust the initial HP values to ensure the battle ends after these two turns. We can keep the foe's creature HP at 3 (which will be reduced to 0 after the player's attack), and set the player's creature HP high enough to survive the foe's attack.

The expected gameplay trace will change to include the foe's turn before the battle ends.

3. Write the solution:

Here's the modified test file:

# Excerpt ID: f57e4098-2792-45cf-b6e0-0a108236a143
```python main_game/tests/test_main_game_scene.py
import pytest
from mini_game_engine.engine.qa_utils import ThreadedSceneRunner, find_select_thing
from main_game.main import App
from main_game.scenes.main_game_scene import MainGameScene

class TestMainGameSceneRandomRun:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    def test_main_game_scene_random_run(self, app):
        for i in range(10):
            print(f"starting random run iteration {i}")
            HumanListener.random_mode = True
            HumanListener.random_mode_counter = 30  # Increased to 30 for more complex scene

            player = app.create_player(f"player_{i}")
            main_game_scene = MainGameScene(app, player)

            class TransitionFromScene(Exception):
                pass

            def exit_scene(*args, **kwargs):
                raise TransitionFromScene()

            with patch.object(MainGameScene, '_transition_to_scene', side_effect=exit_scene) as mock_transition:
                try:
                    main_game_scene.run()
                except TransitionFromScene:
                    print(f"exiting target scene `MainGameScene` so ending run {i}")
                except RandomModeGracefulExit:
                    print(f"`random_mode_counter` reached 0 and the game did not crash. Ending run {i} gracefully")
                else:
                    assert mock_transition.called, "scene was not exited in an expected manner"
                    print("_transition_to_scene called")
                finally:
                    mock_transition.reset_mock()

class TestMainGameScene:
    @pytest.fixture
    def app(self):
        return App()

    @pytest.fixture
    def player(self, app):
        return app.create_player("test_player")

    @pytest.fixture
    def scene(self, app, player):
        return MainGameScene(app, player)

    def test_normal_battle_flow(self, scene):
        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        max_rounds = 10
        for _ in range(max_rounds):
            # Player's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Foe's turn
            choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
            tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
            runner.make_choice(tackle)

            # Check if the battle has ended
            try:
                assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"
                break
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            pytest.fail("Battle did not end within the maximum number of rounds")

        # Check final state
        assert (scene.player_creature.hp <= 0) != (scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0)
        if scene.player_creature.hp <= 0:
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp > 0
        else:
            assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
            assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0

    def test_player_wins(self, scene):
        # Set player's creature HP to 10 (full health) and foe's creature HP to 3
        scene.player_creature.hp = 10
        scene.foe_creature.hp = 3

        runner = ThreadedSceneRunner()
        runner.start_game(scene)

        # Player's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.player)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Foe's turn
        choices = runner.dequeue_wait_for_choice(scene.foe)
        tackle = find_select_thing(choices, "tackle")
        runner.make_choice(tackle)

        # Check that the battle ended
        assert runner.dequeue_transition_to_scene() == "MainMenuScene"

        # Check final state
        assert scene.player_creature.hp > 0
        assert scene.foe_creature.hp <= 0
```

In this solution, we've made the following changes to the `test_player_wins` function:

1. We keep the initial HP settings as they were (10 for player, 3 for foe).
2. After handling the player's turn, we now also handle the foe's turn.
3. We then expect the scene transition to occur after both turns are complete.
4. Finally, we check the final state to ensure the player won (player's creature HP > 0, foe's creature HP <= 0).

These changes align the test with the actual game logic, where the battle end is checked after both players have taken their turns.
